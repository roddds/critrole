SAM: You have to remember

127
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.980

MATT: It'll come in handy.

129
00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.094
LIAM: Written in pink, "investigating well."

130
00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:13.090

"Succubus equals resistance against cold, fire, lightning,

139
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.200
poison, non magical," and spooky sexy speeches.

140
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.792

142
00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:46.230

If not, we'll correct it on socials,

153

00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:02.547
MARISHA: Livestream our baby.

180
00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.413
MATT: Oh, no, get him off on the wrong...

181
00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:06.018
LIAM: Everything is content.

182
00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:09.100
MATT: Yeah, we'll see you guys at Gen Con.

183
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.389
Check out critrole.com for more details there.

184
00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.230
We're also going to be at Emerald City Comic Con

185
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.691
this weekend, like very soon. We're leaving tomorrow.

186
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:18.630
You can check out all the details on both of these events

187
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.863
at critrole.com/events.

188
00:07:20.863 --> 00:07:24.604
We have, as some of you probably know,

189
00:07:24.604 --> 00:07:26.853
a Kickstarter for an animated series.

190
00:07:26.853 --> 00:07:28.988
(cheering)

191
00:07:28.988 --> 00:07:29.821
MATT: That is crazy.

192
00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:31.100
Travis, if you want to talk about this a little bit.

193
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.520
TRAVIS: Yeah. Guys, we continue to be blown away.

194
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.730
We have passed some incredible milestones so far.

195
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.490
We have passed over 53,000 backers.

196
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.950
That is so amazing.

197
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.410
We cannot thank you enough.

198
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.390
We love you so much for sharing our excitement

199
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.190
and passion for this animated now season, this series.

200
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.670
We are so close to our next stretch goal,

201
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.670
which is 7.5 million. If we hit that-- I know, I know!

202
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.510
I don't even know what these words are.

203
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.036
If we hit that, we're able to unlock two more episodes

204
00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:07.490
of the beloved Briarwood arc,

205
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.490
and we will give you more of that creepy shit

206
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.110
that you want just as much as we do.

207
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.960
Also, we will be unlocking a special one shot

208
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.654
featuring some of our favorite Vox Machina campaign guests.

209
00:08:19.654 --> 00:08:24.110
Confirmed to play, schedules, yep, yep, yep,

210
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.140
professional schedules, you know, TBD,

211
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.200
but we got Felicia Day, we got Wil Wheaton,

212
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.614
we got Will Friedle, we got Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

213
00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:35.530
We got some beauties for you, and they're going to have to

214
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.613
fucking fight each other.

215
00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:40.509
MATT: I got ideas.

216
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:41.342
TRAVIS: Yes. Ideas.

217
00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:42.530
Matt has ideas.

218
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.230
Anyway, if you want to check out our campaign,

219
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.400

221
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.050
MATT: No, don't.

222
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.830
Really, thank you guys so much for the support.

223
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.920
This has been overwhelming on like a spiritual level.

224
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.540
It's incredible.

225
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.073
We're but one of many creators out there.

226
00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:06.280
Beyond supporting us, this is a great community,

227
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.205
a lot of great folks you can check out.

228
00:09:08.205 --> 00:09:09.288
Go to Kickstarter Games

229
00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:11.140
to see a lot of other programs that are out there.

230
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.540
I've been supporting through the years,

231
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.160
even just recently this week supported

232
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.054
some great projects like Swordsfall.

233
00:09:16.054 --> 00:09:18.353
Or Humblewood. Go see what else is on there

234
00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:20.570
and what other people we can also help lift up

235
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.420
with this fantastic push of generosity and excitement.

236
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.288
Thank you guys very much.

237
00:09:27.288 --> 00:09:30.710
We have, Laura, an update on merch, I believe.

238
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.510
LAURA: Oh, we do.

239
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.351
TRAVIS: Get it, girl.

240
00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:35.036
LAURA: Here's a little treat for you guys.

241
00:09:35.036 --> 00:09:39.553
In the store right now is the Menagerie Coast.

242
00:09:41.252 --> 00:09:43.873
ALL: Ooh.

243
00:09:43.873 --> 00:09:45.760
LAURA: You may notice, it looks very similar to

244
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.090
our beautiful Wildemount map.

245
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.530
They go very well together.

246
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.363
SAM: Oh, do they?

247
00:09:52.363 --> 00:09:55.283
LAURA: Yeah. They're the same size.

248
00:09:55.283 --> 00:09:56.574
TRAVIS: It's almost like

249
00:09:56.574 --> 00:09:57.732
Deven Rue made that gorgeous piece.

250
00:09:57.732 --> 00:10:00.390
LAURA: Deven Rue did make this gorgeous piece!

251
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.430
Speaking of Deven Rue, yeah.

252
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.793
She's amazing.

253
00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:05.720
Yeah, check it out. It's in the store now,

254
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.260
as well as a bunch of other awesome things.

255
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.030
Oh, and by the way, it's in the UK shop, as well.

256
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.650
MATT: Get that fast delivery.

257
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.740
Thank you guys so much.

258
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.580
I believe that's all of our announcements.

259
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.052
Let's go ahead and dive in

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:23.927

295
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:05.137
MATT: Hello, and welcome back everyone.

296
00:12:05.137 --> 00:12:08.456
Last we left off:

297
00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:12.693
The Mighty Nein have found themselves

298
00:12:12.693 --> 00:12:17.456
in the eastern wastes of Xhorhas, seeking the recently

299
00:12:17.456 --> 00:12:21.731
captured and currently imprisoned

300
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:23.756
husband of Nott

301
00:12:23.756 --> 00:12:27.255
from essentially a past life.

302
00:12:28.671 --> 00:12:30.946
Upon traveling eastward through the wastes,

303
00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:33.211
dodging various dangers and entities,

304
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.494
you found yourselves in Asarius, the City of Beasts,

305
00:12:35.494 --> 00:12:37.949
which currently seems to exist under the banner

306
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:39.949
of the Kryn Dynasty.

307
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:42.876
A city brimming with ogres and goblins

308
00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:45.036
and bugbears and gnolls and all sorts

309
00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:47.793
of other monstrous races from the empire standpoint,

310
00:12:47.793 --> 00:12:50.849
living relatively civilized existence.

311
00:12:50.849 --> 00:12:54.534
Though, a mounting army itself, preparing to move westward

312
00:12:54.534 --> 00:12:57.310
to dive into conflict with the Dwendalian empire,

313
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.660
where you hail, most of you, at the very least.

314
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.230
Upon asking around the city, some of you, incognito,

315
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.713
as more acceptable members of the society,

316
00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:11.830
you managed to make a trade for both business and gold

317
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.353
for three moorbounder beasts.

318
00:13:15.736 --> 00:13:20.736
Trained them to be somewhat amiable to being mounts.

319
00:13:21.456 --> 00:13:23.674
Also upon speaking with

320
00:13:23.674 --> 00:13:27.430
the Kryn leader, it seems, or at least

321
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.190
one of the more prominent individuals here,

322
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.430
Lady Zethriss Olios, presented your capabilities

323
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.597
as an investigation crew.

324
00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:36.830
At least these two did.

325
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.142
Managed to convince her that your skill is not just boastful

326
00:13:40.142 --> 00:13:44.280
and were given two options to possibly make some money

327
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.660
and gain some favor with her rule in the city.

328
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.010
One of which was to hunt down a spy,

329
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.020
an empire spy here.

330
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.490
The other was to seek out the source of the seemingly

331
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.473
growing demonic force,

332
00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:03.531
this seeping abyssal influence

333
00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:05.500
that seems to be creeping into the city.

334
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.873
If you can find this source and snuff it out,

335
00:14:07.873 --> 00:14:12.858
both a good monetary reward and or a trade for favor

336
00:14:12.858 --> 00:14:15.010
with the Bright Queen herself,

337
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.420
might be able to be had.

338
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.610
In searching for this, you made your way,

339
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.530
eventually, towards the northern center of the city.

340
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.956
Upon speaking with a rather dimwitted

341
00:14:24.956 --> 00:14:29.756
and bulky bugbear, through fright and threat,

342
00:14:29.756 --> 00:14:32.420
seemed to be having some strange dreams,

343
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.030
where he was being enticed by spectral entities

344
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.830
to do bad things.

345
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.433
You came back later in the evening,

346
00:14:40.433 --> 00:14:44.150
after resting in the practically stables outside

347
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.880
of the Four Corners Inn,

348
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.880
and discovered these spectral demonic entities

349
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.770
harassing him in his sleep.

350
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.389
You immediately ran into the fight

351
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:59.140
and after a brief scuffle, they fled towards the well,

352
00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.660
to the back of the building, in this part of the city.

353
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.720
You went down into the well, discovered that a portion

354
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.540
of the inside of the wall had collapsed inward

355
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.360
where a tunnel continued within.

356
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.130
One by one, you all made your way down

357
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.673
into this mysterious tunnel and began to follow it

358
00:15:12.673 --> 00:15:15.469
as it curved to the left into shadow and into

359
00:15:15.469 --> 00:15:20.460
the mysterious continuation of this series

360
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.574
of tunnels and chambers. So Mighty Nein,

361
00:15:23.574 --> 00:15:26.556
what would you like to do?

362
00:15:26.556 --> 00:15:28.967
SAM: Ah!

363
00:15:28.967 --> 00:15:30.200
MATT: Good response.

364
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.258
LIAM: Nott is--

365
00:15:31.258 --> 00:15:33.474
SAM: Invisible, and running ahead.

366
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:36.190
TRAVIS: Tip of the spear.

367
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.630
LIAM: Did you drop some light at the end?

368
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.600
TALIESIN: I was going to ask if we want some light.

369
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.698
I don't think that we're trying to be sneaky, so.

370
00:15:44.698 --> 00:15:46.913
LAURA: Yeah, they know we're coming.

371
00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:48.254
TALIESIN: We have light.

372
00:15:48.254 --> 00:15:51.687
MATT: Marching order, technically on this, is that we have--

373
00:15:51.687 --> 00:15:53.065
ALL: Technically.

374
00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:55.410
MATT: We have Nott at the front who is invisible.

375
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.700
SAM: You have an invisible Nott?

376
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.530
MATT: I have an invisible tiny person figure that works.

377
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.280
LAURA and SAM: That looks like Nott.

378
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.796
MATT: It works well enough.

379
00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:03.929
TRAVIS: We're working our way through the tunnel,

380
00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.323
but it's super tight, right?

381
00:16:05.323 --> 00:16:08.080
MATT: It's about ten, sometimes pushing 15 feet.

382
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.769
You can go maybe two to three people shoulder to shoulder

383
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:15.761
comfortably, as far as using your space.

384
00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:17.500
You can squeeze closer if you need to.

385
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.490
TRAVIS: I'll be right behind you.

386
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.323
MATT: Fjord is--

387
00:16:20.323 --> 00:16:21.798
SAM: I'm trying to be sneaky.

388
00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:23.510
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm with you, man.

389
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.350
MARISHA: I'll be behind Fjord.

390
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.520
LAURA: I'll follow behind Beau, unless?

391
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.180
TRAVIS: Keep a good distance.

392
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.540
TALIESIN: I'll go behind you.

393
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.570
TRAVIS: Little lady luck herself doesn't need help,

394
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.798
you'll be fine.

395
00:16:33.798 --> 00:16:35.361
SAM: Are you my chaperone?

396
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:39.170
LIAM: I will go in front of Yasha.

397
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.478
LAURA: Clerics together forever.

398
00:16:41.478 --> 00:16:42.774
SAM: Oh no.

399
00:16:44.017 --> 00:16:46.047
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

400
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:50.490
All right, so. Nott.

401
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.823
First off, I'd like you to make a

402
00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:54.243
stealth check with advantage.

403
00:16:54.243 --> 00:16:57.760
SAM: Natural 20. Natural, no.

404
00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.709
MATT: What is the total of that?

405
00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:02.510
SAM: It's a million.

406
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.210
It is stealth, it's 31.

407
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.196
MATT: Jesus Christ, okay.

408
00:17:07.196 --> 00:17:09.313
You feel pretty confident no one notices

409
00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:13.473
you traversing the interior of these darkened tunnels.

410
00:17:13.473 --> 00:17:16.670
The walls are slick with the moisture

411
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.094
of the ground water that normally seeps into the well

412
00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:23.734
and this deep area of the ground, within Asarius.

413
00:17:23.734 --> 00:17:27.530
The air is humid and smells metallic

414
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.740
to the nose, like similar

415
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.850
to the aftermath of a cannon blast.

416
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.857
Basing it on your own previous experience.

417
00:17:34.857 --> 00:17:39.198
Move around the corner and the tunnel continues

418
00:17:39.198 --> 00:17:42.450
after the slight curvature to arc downward,

419
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.462
and then it evens out a bit about 60 feet ahead of you.

420
00:17:46.462 --> 00:17:48.777
Most of this seems like it may have at one point

421
00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:51.270
been an underground river that is either

422
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.400
dried up or was diverted, and so you can see

423
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.880
this mineral build up in the sides,

424
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.770
and the floor is pretty smooth,

425
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.400
as opposed to the roof area, which is a little more rough

426
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.763
and natural gathering stalactites made of various

427
00:18:02.763 --> 00:18:05.470
minerals and materials that over time just began

428
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.940
to drip and gather.

429
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.250
You find yourself, the rest of you, at some points,

430
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.680
having to duck down a little bit through some of these.

431
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.900
While the tunnel is wide, it's not as high as it is wide,

432
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.996
and so at points, it gets maybe five-foot,

433
00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:18.680
four and a half feet, and you're having to crouch

434
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.256
and find your way through.

435
00:18:20.256 --> 00:18:22.988
You ahead, make perception check for me.

436
00:18:22.988 --> 00:18:24.829
SAM: I'm great at those. Seven.

437
00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:27.062
MATT: Cool. You continue moving ahead.

438
00:18:27.062 --> 00:18:29.009
SAM: Looks like a cave.

439
00:18:29.009 --> 00:18:30.690
LAURA: I like that you scout ahead and you can't see shit.

440
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.171
SAM: It's my one weakness.

441
00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:36.038
(laughter)

442
00:18:36.038 --> 00:18:37.990
MATT: Travis, how far behind Nott are you traveling?

443
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.520
TRAVIS: 20 feet.
MATT: 20 feet, you got it.

444
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.430
Everyone else is in a five-foot line behind Fjord or

445
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.970
more distance between each of you? Just for my own.

446
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.880
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll stick up on Fjord.

447
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.150
MATT: Okay, cool.

448
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.560
Make a perception check for me, Fjord.

449
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.220
TRAVIS: Okay.

450
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.860
That's a natural one.

451
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.712
MATT: Okay, so.

452
00:19:01.712 --> 00:19:02.545
LAURA: Great.

453
00:19:02.545 --> 00:19:07.545
MATT: You guys continue down this path, following Fjord,

454
00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:09.860
who comfortably is following Nott, both of them very certain

455
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.713
of their surroundings.

456
00:19:11.713 --> 00:19:13.320
MARISHA: I trust her implicitly, right?

457
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.080
She will like just tell us if she sees something.

458
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.793
TRAVIS: Totally, she's got a nose for this stuff.

459
00:19:17.793 --> 00:19:18.855
It's dark in here.

460
00:19:18.855 --> 00:19:20.580
MARISHA: So dark, right?

461
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.850
TRAVIS: Where are you? Ah!

462
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.130
MARISHA: Sorry.

463
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.990
TALIESIN: You do have a light on, you know that, right?

464
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.740
It's like you guys are, okay.

465
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.250
MATT: Caduceus comes around the corner behind you,

466
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.330
like this beacon of bright, cantrip light

467
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.012
torch light, filtering in the vicinity.

468
00:19:38.012 --> 00:19:41.951
Both Nott and Fjord, you first hear what sounds like.

469
00:19:41.951 --> 00:19:43.330
(grunting)

470
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.657
The minor chatter.

471
00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:49.240
Looking up to the area, what you didn't see,

472
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.650
at a distance, because it's just hard to see down here,

473
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.560
and you're not very focused,

474
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.960
in the archway of this tunnel,

475
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.130
there's two creatures that are

476
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.330
grappled up and affixed to the wall and

477
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.840
grinding something, like sharpening their claws

478
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.130
in the stone, it looks like.

479
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.870
While one sits on the ground, below.

480
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.600
No more than like two feet tall each.

481
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.210
About the size of Nott,

482
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.212
crouched down, arms and legs folded in.

483
00:20:15.212 --> 00:20:18.430
What little bit you can see as the light comes in,

484
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.500
a deep gray, like a blue gray tint

485
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.080
to their leathery skin. They turn around,

486
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.473
and you can see these wide,

487
00:20:27.473 --> 00:20:30.730
lemur-like eyes, but black.

488
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.030
These tiny mouths with sharp teeth

489
00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.280
growl in your direction, and I need everyone

490
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.010
to roll initiative because you never noticed them.

491
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.066
LAURA: None of us saw it.
MATT: None of you saw it.

492
00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:44.725
TRAVIS: Hold your position.

493
00:20:44.725 --> 00:20:46.419
MARISHA: (yelling)

494
00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:47.820
SAM: Oh boy, we're already in a fight?

495
00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.114
TRAVIS: Good way to start a Thursday.

496
00:20:51.114 --> 00:20:51.947
Fuck.

497
00:20:51.947 --> 00:20:53.379
LAURA: What'd you roll?

498
00:20:53.379 --> 00:20:54.242
SAM: Terrible.

499
00:20:54.242 --> 00:20:56.450
TRAVIS: Initiative was balls.

500
00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.910
TALIESIN: It's just a hallway.

501
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.820
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's "just a hallway."

502
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.510
MATT: Actually, the arch would be down here.

503
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.310
Nott, you're right there.

504
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.768
Here we have everyone else following up right behind.

505
00:21:19.017 --> 00:21:21.580
There we have it.

506
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.360
Now for the creatures.

507
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.480
LAURA: You know what would be cool is if we could have

508
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.950
a thing that dropped in the middle

509
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.448
so it could be just a little bit lower than us.

510
00:21:30.448 --> 00:21:32.920
SAM: You mean the table went down or you could just

511
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.833
stand up a little?

512
00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:37.083
LAURA: Some of us are lazy, Sam.

513
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.730
TRAVIS: Jesus.

514
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.912
MATT: Yeah, roll initiative on this.

515
00:21:41.912 --> 00:21:42.903
LAURA: They've got wings?

516
00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:44.070
MATT: Technically, these creatures do not,

517
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.820
I just didn't have three minis of them with wings.

518
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.900
Close enough size and coloration, you get it.

519
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.880
LAURA: Yeah, it counts.

520
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.518
MATT: It's fine. All righty, so.

521
00:21:53.518 --> 00:21:55.330
Okay.

522
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.400
TRAVIS: Uh-oh, that's a bad okay.

523
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.920
MATT: 25 to 20.

524
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.200
MARISHA: Oh, shit, y'all.

525
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.930
MATT: 20 to 15.
MARISHA: 18.

526
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.760
LAURA: 19.

527
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.830
LIAM: Also 19.
SAM: 19, 19.

528
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:12.813
MATT: Then we have Beau.

529
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.028
15 to ten.

530
00:22:16.028 --> 00:22:17.747
TRAVIS: 14.
TALIESIN: 13.

531
00:22:17.747 --> 00:22:20.347
MARISHA: You know, maybe we did okay,

532
00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:22.230
maybe I rushed to judge us.

533
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.425
TRAVIS: No, we're fucked.
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

534
00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.583
MATT: Fjord got a 14, you said?

535
00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:25.421
TRAVIS: Yeah, Fjord 14.

536
00:22:25.421 --> 00:22:26.413
MATT: Caduceus, 13?

537
00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:27.246
TALIESIN: 13.

538
00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:29.123
SAM: Ten

539
00:22:29.123 --> 00:22:30.220
I'm ten.

540
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.350
What Yasha get?

541
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.450
TRAVIS: Oh, six.

542
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.466
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

543
00:22:34.466 --> 00:22:36.358
LAURA: Ashley...

544
00:22:36.358 --> 00:22:38.642
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's totally Ashley's fault, it's not mine.

545
00:22:38.642 --> 00:22:41.116
MATT: You got it. Jester, you're up first.

546
00:22:41.116 --> 00:22:43.900
You are just in the space where you can see them,

547
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.400
and you hear the growling, and you just

548
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.180
faintly see at this distance, with your darkvision,

549
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.701
these three figures that turn around.

550
00:22:52.701 --> 00:22:55.634
(growling)

551
00:22:55.634 --> 00:22:57.524
SAM: Three figures? I thought it was two.

552
00:22:57.524 --> 00:22:59.165
MATT: There's two grappled on the walls

553
00:22:59.165 --> 00:23:00.873
that are scratching their claws into the stone,

554
00:23:00.873 --> 00:23:02.016
and there's one on the ground

555
00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:03.632
that seems to be looking up at what they're doing.

556
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.078
All three of them turn around towards you.

557
00:23:06.078 --> 00:23:09.597
LAURA: I'm going to Sacred Flame one of them.

558
00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:10.813
MATT: Which one?

559
00:23:10.813 --> 00:23:12.600
LAURA: The one that's closest to me.

560
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.860
MATT: The one that's on the floor, then, we'd say.

561
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.020
What's the DC, or sorry, what's the--?

562
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.902
LAURA: Dex.
MATT: Dex, all right.

563
00:23:19.902 --> 00:23:21.040
That is going to be a 16.

564
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.710
LAURA: 16 is what you needed.

565
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.270
MATT: All right, so it succeeds.

566
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.870
As you try and reveal it, suddenly there's this burst of

567
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.620
radiant light and it dodges out of the way

568
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.340
and grabs onto the side of the wall,

569
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.160
moving slightly to the side.

570
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.730
The flame has no effect, unfortunately.

571
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.621
That's your action, anything else on your turn?

572
00:23:36.621 --> 00:23:39.042
LAURA: I'm going to scooch up against the wall.

573
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:40.550
MATT: Which one, here?

574
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.740
LAURA: The one closest to me.

575
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.890
Yeah, like that.

576
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.731
MATT: Scoot into that corner there. You got it.

577
00:23:45.731 --> 00:23:50.480
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to say: They're dodgy, be careful.

578
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.850
MATT: Simultaneously, Caleb, as Jester gives this warning,

579
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.683
what are you doing?

580
00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:56.130
LIAM: Can I even see the one that is here?

581
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.963
MATT: You cannot.

582
00:23:56.963 --> 00:23:59.350
LIAM: Can I see anything?

583
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.050
MATT: Yes, you can because the light that Caduceus has--

584
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.280
he's cast Light. You can see the chamber about 60-foot

585
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.150
from Caduceus. So yeah, you can see in there.

586
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.760
LIAM: Do I have eyes on any of this?

587
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.040
MATT: Right now you do not, you'd have to move in

588
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.800
to get closer, and all you know is what Jester told you,

589
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.000
and you saw her shoot something in that direction.

590
00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.230
LIAM: I am going to move to the side behind Caduceus there.

591
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.963
Yeah, and I'm going to hold a Fire Bolt

592
00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:27.320
until something becomes visible.

593
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.130
MATT: Okay, so you're holding your action with a Fire Bolt.

594
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.755
LIAM: 'Til I see a creature.

595
00:24:30.755 --> 00:24:32.737
MATT: You got it. That finishes your go, Caleb.

596
00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:33.920
Beau, you're up.

597
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.703
MARISHA: Do I see them?

598
00:24:35.703 --> 00:24:37.711
MATT: You do because of the light that's being shed

599
00:24:37.711 --> 00:24:39.628
by Caduceus and the noise they made, since you're

600
00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:41.770
in proximity to that point, heard Jester say that,

601
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.170
you glance over and you have a pretty high perception

602
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.200
so easily you see the three creatures

603
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.670
in somewhat of a V-shape across the interior chamber.

604
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:51.910
MARISHA: They're in a flying V.

605
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.170
Okay, I'm going to run up to the one on the ground.

606
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.687
MATT: To this one?

607
00:24:55.687 --> 00:24:59.533
MARISHA: To the one on the ground, I guess, yeah. 25.

608
00:24:59.533 --> 00:25:01.140
MATT: 25 will put you right there.

609
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.730
You find yourself hitting something with your hip

610
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.140
as you pull by and Nott, you get a little knock

611
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.131
on the shoulder.

612
00:25:08.131 --> 00:25:09.714
SAM: Ow.
MARISHA: Sorry.

613
00:25:09.714 --> 00:25:10.570
MATT: You are face to face

614
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.770
with the one on the ground in front of you.

615
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.186
You see, it's like (growling).

616
00:25:14.186 --> 00:25:19.186
MARISHA: I just rear back and go for a full football punt.

617
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.602
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

618
00:25:21.602 --> 00:25:23.159
TRAVIS: Football punt.

619
00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:27.618
MARISHA: It's a natural 19.
MATT: That hits.

620
00:25:30.938 --> 00:25:34.220
MARISHA: That's unarmed, right? Okay.

621
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.160
Are my feet-- my fists can punch ghosts,

622
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.281
can my feet kick demons?
MATT: Your unarmed strikes

623
00:25:39.281 --> 00:25:41.821
are considered magical as a monk,

624
00:25:41.821 --> 00:25:43.650
so your feet also can punch and kick things, you're fine.

625
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.570
TRAVIS: What sound does a football punt make?

626
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.670
MARISHA: Like me making the punt or the football

627
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.482
making the punt?
TRAVIS: Either one.

628
00:25:52.482 --> 00:25:53.981
MARISHA: (grunting)

629
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:56.231
(laughter)

630
00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:59.330
That works for both, right?

631
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.300
MATT: How much damage?

632
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.133
MARISHA: Nine.

633
00:26:01.133 --> 00:26:02.541
MATT: Nine points of damage.

634
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:04.882
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and LAURA: (groaning)

635
00:26:04.882 --> 00:26:06.251
TRAVIS: Took damage just from the exertion.

636
00:26:06.251 --> 00:26:07.661
LAURA: I imagine that's the sound she made, then.

637
00:26:07.661 --> 00:26:08.970
MARISHA: (groaning)

638
00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.580
MATT: Crack! Your foot impacts the creature's chest.

639
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.510
It's relatively light,

640
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.810
and it feels like you're hitting a sack

641
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.430
of potatoes before it slams into the ceiling

642
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.440
and falls back down in place.

643
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.780
It looks extremely hurt at the immediate impact.

644
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.063
TRAVIS: They're probably cute.

645
00:26:24.063 --> 00:26:25.605
MATT: Continue, you still have another attack.

646
00:26:25.605 --> 00:26:30.242
MARISHA: It's like a Gremlins thing. He's really cute, pop.

647
00:26:30.242 --> 00:26:31.308
Another 19.

648
00:26:31.308 --> 00:26:32.250
MATT: All right, roll damage.

649
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.830
SAM: Kill this thing.
TRAVIS: Kill Gizmo, let's go.

650
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.463
MARISHA: Seven.
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) No!

651
00:26:36.463 --> 00:26:39.391
MATT: As he's (groaning), you just, "Aw," (impact).

652
00:26:39.391 --> 00:26:42.340
Smack it down and (splattering).

653
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.214
LAURA: That's so sad.

654
00:26:44.214 --> 00:26:46.272
LIAM: (cute voice) My baby!

655
00:26:46.272 --> 00:26:47.378
MATT: It has collapsed to the ground.

656
00:26:47.378 --> 00:26:48.930
LAURA: Oh no!

657
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.448
MATT: You hear, "Why?"

658
00:26:53.448 --> 00:26:55.200
MARISHA: So guilty!

659
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.360
MATT: All right, that finishes--

660
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.000
LAURA: I'm really glad I missed them.

661
00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.972
MATT: You still have your bonus action,

662
00:26:59.972 --> 00:27:02.586
and you have ten feet more of movement.

663
00:27:02.586 --> 00:27:04.750
MARISHA: Are these guys even in my reach?

664
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.730
MATT: They're not, you have to move up to them.

665
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.170
MARISHA: Can I hit them with a staff, though,

666
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.300
if I get near them?

667
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.220
MATT: Staffs don't have reach, so it would be the same

668
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.000
as just going up to them.

669
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.860
I think you have enough movement

670
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.760
because you're a monk and you're crazy fast.

671
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.700
MARISHA: I'll move forward and then do Patient Defense.

672
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.677
MATT: Move forward five more feet?

673
00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:23.260
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll just get in front of Nott.

674
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.707
Then hug the wall a little.

675
00:27:25.707 --> 00:27:26.915
MATT: Hug the wall a bit on this side?

676
00:27:26.915 --> 00:27:27.870
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to be out of other people's way.

677
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.703
MATT: You got it.

678
00:27:28.703 --> 00:27:29.795
MARISHA: Patient defense.

679
00:27:29.795 --> 00:27:31.245
MATT: You go into your dodge stance,

680
00:27:31.245 --> 00:27:32.823
preparing for any sort of assault from head on.

681
00:27:32.823 --> 00:27:36.861
That finishes your go. Now it's their turn.

682
00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:39.501
The two creatures on the sides, looking about,

683
00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:43.370
one of them is going to look down at you

684
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.155
as you go into Patient Defense and go.

685
00:27:45.155 --> 00:27:47.830
(growling)

686
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.050
And just growl at you.

687
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.450
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me.

688
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.580
MARISHA: Oh no. Wisdom save?

689
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.122
Do we still have the thing?
MATT: No.

690
00:27:55.122 --> 00:27:57.600
TALIESIN: Yeah, not until I see ghosts.

691
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.575
MARISHA: Does this count?

692
00:27:59.575 --> 00:28:01.614
MATT: It counts. If it fell, it counted.

693
00:28:01.614 --> 00:28:03.043
TRAVIS: But it's on a lopsided surface.

694
00:28:03.043 --> 00:28:04.509
LIAM: It counts.

695
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:06.350
MATT: If it was good, you would have said it counted.

696
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.083
It's fine.

697
00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:09.500
Not you, but the whole party would have.

698
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.300
MARISHA: Five.

699
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.250
MATT: For some reason, the guilt of killing one of these

700
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.066
creatures and this thing just screeching at you,

701
00:28:19.066 --> 00:28:22.790
the combination of guilt and the visage

702
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.514
of this terrible little demon creature

703
00:28:24.514 --> 00:28:29.514
scares the shit out of you and you are frightened.

704
00:28:29.936 --> 00:28:32.599
LIAM: (growling)

705
00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:37.160
MARISHA: You guys, what if their families haunt me forever?

706
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.785
TRAVIS: Better you than us.

707
00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:41.680
MATT: Then it's going to leap down

708
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.600
from the ground and scurry past and

709
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.592
disappear from sight and around the corner.

710
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.570
Yep, just out of sight of you, Nott, as well.

711
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.850
You're not quite sure where it is.

712
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.950
The other one, the space of where it is, let's see.

713
00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.810
Yeah, it's going to leap down

714
00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.390
and assault you while the other one scurries around

715
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.790
out of the way as you're frightened,

716
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.460
it leaps down to strike at you,

717
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.450
angry that you took out its friend.

718
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.153
SAM: Kill Beau.
LAURA: No.

719
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.380
MATT: Make its claw attack against you.

720
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.800
SAM: The cute little gremlin guy.

721
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.290
LIAM: We just said that Caleb can see it now?

722
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.270
MARISHA: Is my Patient Defense still a thing?

723
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.680
MATT: Yes, it is.

724
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.261
You're still, you're just like (gasping).

725
00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:24.138
You're frighteningly dodging them.

726
00:29:24.138 --> 00:29:28.270
All right, that's 19 to hit.

727
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.940
You rolled it twice in a row, 19 to hit.

728
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.780
Is that a hit?

729
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.805
MARISHA: No.

730
00:29:31.805 --> 00:29:33.478
Armor class of 20.
MATT: Ooh, look at that.

731
00:29:33.478 --> 00:29:35.239
SAM: What?
TRAVIS: I'm looking at it.

732
00:29:35.239 --> 00:29:38.213
MATT: (yelling) You're slapping it away, scared.

733
00:29:38.213 --> 00:29:39.964
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

734
00:29:39.964 --> 00:29:43.247
TRAVIS: (repeatedly) No, no, no!

735
00:29:45.501 --> 00:29:46.894
MATT: Let's see.

736
00:29:46.894 --> 00:29:49.079
TRAVIS: What other toys does he have at his disposal?

737
00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.440
LIAM: When that creature dropped into Caleb's sight,

738
00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.350
I can see a straight line, so Fire Bolt away.

739
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.910
MATT: Go for it.

740
00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:56.843
LIAM: 18 to hit.

741
00:29:56.843 --> 00:29:58.818
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

742
00:29:58.818 --> 00:30:01.735
LIAM: <i>Shite.</i> Where did the spell go?

743
00:30:05.615 --> 00:30:08.564
2d10, 2d10.

744
00:30:08.564 --> 00:30:10.239
Seven points of damage.

745
00:30:10.239 --> 00:30:12.413
MATT: Seven points of damage, all right.

746
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.153
It bursts, the flame hits it, but it seems to not quite

747
00:30:18.153 --> 00:30:21.402
burn and char as much as you were hoping.

748
00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:25.100
As it's released and hits it, it looks towards you

749
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.450
and (grunting) skitters and is going to

750
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.997
attempt to flee out of range.

751
00:30:29.997 --> 00:30:31.705
Beau, you do get an attack.

752
00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:32.850
MARISHA: Oh, I can still attack it?

753
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:33.920
MATT: If you want to, yeah.

754
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.590
MARISHA: Frightened just means I can't get closer, right?

755
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.100
MATT: You can't get closer and you have disadvantage

756
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.470
if the creature is within sight in source of your fright

757
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.090
but it has moved out of the way,

758
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.586
so it's just a regular strike.

759
00:30:43.586 --> 00:30:44.880
MARISHA: Sentinel, bitches.

760
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.900
That hits with a 22.

761
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.097
MATT: 22 hits, yeah.

762
00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:51.563
MARISHA: 24? 20-- it hits.

763
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.710
11 and he is not moving.

764
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.890
MATT: Oh, he's definitely not moving because you

765
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.130
(boof) and just splat him on the ground.

766
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.780
MARISHA: Oh, I did it again.

767
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.060
SAM: Gerbil killer.

768
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.550
TRAVIS: Wow.

769
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.462
These are the last of their line.

770
00:31:11.462 --> 00:31:13.319
MATT: Now there's two of their corpses

771
00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:17.930
lifelessly there, akimbo in the center

772
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.350
of this smooth stone floor of the chamber,

773
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.170
that finishes their go. Fjord, you're up.

774
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.090
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to dash double for a whopping speed

775
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:28.880
of 60 feet, make it down the hallway,

776
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.400
turn a agosh.

777
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.439
MATT: As you turn around the corner,

778
00:31:32.439 --> 00:31:34.550
you do see the other creature is right about here

779
00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.050
and is running the other direction.

780
00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.183
TRAVIS: Hey!

781
00:31:37.183 --> 00:31:39.610
MATT: You've got ten more feet there, if you want to.

782
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.920
You can't quite get into melee with it,

783
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.980
but you're ten feet behind it.

784
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:43.813
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

785
00:31:43.813 --> 00:31:45.630
MATT: Finishes your go.

786
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.330
Finishing Fjord's turn, Caduceus, you're up.

787
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.800
TALIESIN: I'm going to move 30 feet ahead.

788
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.930
Can I see anything?

789
00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.610
MATT: (counting) 30 right there.

790
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.690
You see Fjord around the corner.

791
00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.142
That's all you can see

792
00:31:59.142 --> 00:32:00.530
from your current place, unfortunately.

793
00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:01.738
TALIESIN: All right.

794
00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.738
Yeah, that's not--

795
00:32:05.738 --> 00:32:07.981
TRAVIS: He's a-running!

796
00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:11.572
TALIESIN: I'm actually just going to

797
00:32:11.572 --> 00:32:13.810
use my bonus action

798
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:17.330
to get underneath the little stone thing.

799
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.560
I'm going to move up forward, I mean I'm going to use

800
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.851
my action--

801
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:21.684
MATT: To move up underneath here?

802
00:32:21.684 --> 00:32:23.030
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to get a little further up.

803
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.640
MATT: Okay, you move a little further up, and you now have

804
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.473
eye contact.

805
00:32:25.473 --> 00:32:26.723
TALIESIN: I now have eye contact,

806
00:32:26.723 --> 00:32:29.380
but I don't have any good bonus actions.

807
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.560
I don't think I have anything bonus action-y I can do.

808
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.393
No.

809
00:32:33.393 --> 00:32:34.970
MATT: That ends your go.

810
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.990
Then, following up from Caduceus, we have Nott.

811
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.990
SAM: I will, Nott will, still invisible, run ahead.

812
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.990
Rejoining.

813
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.350
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30.

814
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.280
35 gets you into melee with the creature.

815
00:32:50.172 --> 00:32:51.670
SAM: I will continue

816
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.230
running past the creature.

817
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.138
TRAVIS: Yeah!

818
00:32:55.138 --> 00:32:57.540
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

819
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.110
The creature does hear you rush past,

820
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.090
because you're not trying to move stealthily.

821
00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:04.006
It just lashes out.

822
00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:05.945
It has disadvantage on the attack.

823
00:33:05.945 --> 00:33:07.606
Probably not going to do anything.

824
00:33:07.606 --> 00:33:08.956
Natural 20.

825
00:33:08.956 --> 00:33:10.564
But has disadvantage.

826
00:33:10.564 --> 00:33:12.997
Four, yeah, total nine.

827
00:33:12.997 --> 00:33:15.170
It scratches out into space

828
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.687
where it thinks you might be,

829
00:33:16.687 --> 00:33:17.832
but you're already ten feet ahead, no issue.

830
00:33:17.832 --> 00:33:20.820
LIAM: (as Gollum) Thief!

831
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.640
MATT: You have darted past.

832
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.500
SAM: What is up there, more hallway?

833
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.902
MATT: The hallway continues on from what you can

834
00:33:26.902 --> 00:33:29.800
immediately see before curving to the right a bit.

835
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.140
About 30 feet ahead of you.

836
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.243
SAM: I'll go to the curve. I'll keep going. Use my action.

837
00:33:37.243 --> 00:33:38.351
MATT: Okay, full movement.

838
00:33:38.351 --> 00:33:40.010
You move ahead and get right to the base

839
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.500
of where the curve is up ahead, up there.

840
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.092
SAM: Okay.
MATT: All right.

841
00:33:44.092 --> 00:33:45.592
MATT: That finishes Nott's go, Yasha's up.

842
00:33:45.592 --> 00:33:50.516
TRAVIS: Oh, Yasha will dash her full speed,

843
00:33:50.516 --> 00:33:53.299
80 feet.

844
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.740
MATT: 70, 75, 80.

845
00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.830
Yasha does get into melee with the creature,

846
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.120
just running past.

847
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.200
Pushing off the edge of the corner and darting

848
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.256
around the other way.

849
00:34:03.256 --> 00:34:05.283
TRAIVS: (as Yasha) Hello.

850
00:34:05.283 --> 00:34:06.960
MATT: That finishes Yasha's go.

851
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.440
TRAVIS: With her bonus action, she would like to to rage.

852
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.880
MATT: Okay, Yasha goes into a rage.

853
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.240
Top of the next combat round, Jester, you're up.

854
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.270
LAURA: Oh, okay.

855
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.550
I'm going to come out from my hidey hole

856
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.230
and I'm going to say: Catch up, Caleb.

857
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.805
I'm going to take off.

858
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.560
If I do my normal action, can I see the bug?

859
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.060
MATT: You cannot see it currently.

860
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.333
LAURA: Balls!

861
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:31.700
I'm going to just run around the corner, then.

862
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.940
MATT: Okay.

863
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.260
30.
LAURA: Oh, wait!

864
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.600
No, I'm not going to do that.

865
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.001
I'm going to be back where I was. I'm going to use

866
00:34:41.001 --> 00:34:43.330
my action to pick up the carcasses of the two

867
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.960
little other gremlins.
SAM: Looting them?

868
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.693
LAURA: No, I'm going to put them in the bag for,

869
00:34:47.693 --> 00:34:52.400
our moor-- our things need food.

870
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.272
MATT: Okay, they're big enough to the point where

871
00:34:55.272 --> 00:34:57.592
it'll take you a while to try and squeeze them

872
00:34:57.592 --> 00:35:00.700
into the bag of holding that Fjord has.

873
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.210
Your handy haversack, unfortunately,

874
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.720
the pockets aren't large enough to fit

875
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.292
an entire two foot corpse into it.

876
00:35:06.292 --> 00:35:07.383
SAM: You could just carry it.

877
00:35:07.383 --> 00:35:08.516
MARISHA: I want to see you try!

878
00:35:08.516 --> 00:35:10.099
MATT: You can spend your action gathering their

879
00:35:10.099 --> 00:35:11.223
lifeless bodies.

880
00:35:11.223 --> 00:35:12.282
LIAM: It's the thought that counts.

881
00:35:12.282 --> 00:35:13.708
LAURA: I'll just get one of them

882
00:35:13.708 --> 00:35:16.907
and start using my axe to chop it up.

883
00:35:16.907 --> 00:35:18.670
MATT: That will, however, allow you to put it

884
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.981
in your handy haversack.

885
00:35:20.981 --> 00:35:23.133
TRAVIS: Wow!

886
00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:24.375
MATT: All right, that finishes Jester's go.

887
00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:27.433
LAURA: Yarnball is hungry, you guys!

888
00:35:27.433 --> 00:35:28.512
MATT: You're up, Caleb.

889
00:35:28.512 --> 00:35:29.630
LIAM: I am not going to dash. I am just going to walk up

890
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.230
and watch as Jester is destroying this thing

891
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:37.010
and say: That is more familiar than I would like,

892
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.608
and I am just going to watch our backs--

893
00:35:38.608 --> 00:35:41.792
LAURA: I'm making snacks!

894
00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:44.900
LIAM: -- hold a Fire Bolt if anything comes behind us.

895
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.348
MATT: You got it. That finishes your go.

896
00:35:47.348 --> 00:35:49.674
Beau, you're up. You are still frightened.

897
00:35:49.674 --> 00:35:51.875
MARISHA: (yelling)

898
00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:55.512
LAURA: What's the matter, Beau?

899
00:35:55.512 --> 00:35:57.960
MARISHA: What have I done?

900
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.080
I just punch myself

901
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.100
and I'm going to take an action to do Stillness of Mind

902
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.970
and slap myself out a bit.

903
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:05.803
MATT: Okay.

904
00:36:05.803 --> 00:36:07.540
SAM: What is that?

905
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.280
MATT: You can ignore the frightened condition, right?

906
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.860
MARISHA: Yeah, I get to just shrug off a frightened

907
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.980
or charmed condition, so I just-- They're ugly!

908
00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.380
And then I keep running.

909
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.840
MATT: You got it, all right.

910
00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.032
Now, actually, it only lasts until--

911
00:36:23.032 --> 00:36:24.781
no, it can repeat the saving throw.

912
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:26.937
Does it go away entirely, as part of the ability,

913
00:36:26.937 --> 00:36:29.595
or do you just shrug it off for the round?

914
00:36:29.595 --> 00:36:30.570
LIAM: D&amp;D Beyond!

915
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.262
MATT: I can check it up right now.

916
00:36:32.262 --> 00:36:34.290
MARISHA: Yep, hang on.

917
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.990
Features and traits, features and traits.

918
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.823
MATT: Yes, indeed.

919
00:36:36.823 --> 00:36:40.712
ALL: (tune of "Breaking the Law") Features and traits.

920
00:36:40.712 --> 00:36:42.636
LIAM: Guys, this is a show where you get to

921
00:36:42.636 --> 00:36:43.887
watch us repeat phrases.

922
00:36:43.887 --> 00:36:44.917
MATT: It is ended, correct.

923
00:36:44.917 --> 00:36:48.501
MARISHA: Would it make sense for me to roll to try and

924
00:36:48.501 --> 00:36:50.340
shrug it off before I took an action?

925
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.180
But it still takes an action to roll.

926
00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.650
MATT: Well, no, at the end of your turn,

927
00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.430
you get a chance to roll it off each turn, so yes,

928
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:56.310
it does allow you to move forward.

929
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.730
MARISHA: Okay, cool.
MATT: All right, so you just

930
00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.411
slap slap slap.

931
00:36:59.411 --> 00:37:01.020
It was tiny.

932
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.680
You killed two of its friends super quick,

933
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.430
why were you so scared?

934
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.263
MARISHA: I don't want children,

935
00:37:05.263 --> 00:37:06.943
and I just keep running forward.

936
00:37:06.943 --> 00:37:09.070
(laughter)

937
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.411
MATT: All right, it's getting a little crowded here

938
00:37:11.411 --> 00:37:12.830
in this tunnel area. You could move past your friends

939
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.310
and move up to Yasha, next to this creature

940
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.630
if you want to.

941
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.099
Actually, no, it's going to be a bit tight.

942
00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:18.740
You probably have to hold back for now.

943
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.860
That's as far as you can get.

944
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.290
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

945
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.540
MATT: Creature's turn. The little thing is turned around,

946
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.320
it sees you and then Yasha rushes up

947
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.220
and it's like (grunting)

948
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.137
and it sees Beau and it's like (frustrated growl).

949
00:37:33.672 --> 00:37:35.075
You see like it tenses its whole body

950
00:37:35.075 --> 00:37:35.908
like it's about to just take a shit

951
00:37:35.908 --> 00:37:37.998
and it vanishes.

952
00:37:37.998 --> 00:37:40.446
LAURA: Oh no!

953
00:37:40.446 --> 00:37:42.200
SAM: It's a blink gremlin.

954
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.651
MATT: You see these little foot patters away.

955
00:37:45.651 --> 00:37:47.290
Yasha does get an attack of opportunity,

956
00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.890
a Sentinel attack if she wants to take it.

957
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:52.211
It has disadvantage because it is invisible.

958
00:37:52.211 --> 00:37:53.567
MARISHA: Sentinel bitches.

959
00:37:53.567 --> 00:37:56.160
TRAVIS: (mumbling)

960
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.630
Disadvantage, no, it's an eight.

961
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.312
Eight, nope. She swings, the blade scrapes

962
00:38:00.312 --> 00:38:02.250
across the stone on the side of the wall,

963
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.400
sparks shower off, but it hits nothing,

964
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.410
and you just see the little patters vanish

965
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.455
into the tunnel ahead.

966
00:38:08.455 --> 00:38:11.640
TALIESIN: Is it going to pass Nott?

967
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.670
MATT: You don't know where Nott is.

968
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.740
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, I'm just saying, Nott would get

969
00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.520
an attack of opportunity if they--

970
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.970
MATT: It would if they got caught up to it.

971
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.290
TALIESIN: Okay.
SAM: Nott's awesome perception

972
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.115
will definitely see and hear it coming.

973
00:38:22.115 --> 00:38:24.060
TRAVIS: Invisible like invisible.

974
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.100
MATT: Finishing their go, Fjord, you're up.

975
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.270
TRAVIS: Oh, is it my turn?

976
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:33.270
There are like footprints in the dust?

977
00:38:33.555 --> 00:38:36.040
MATT: Not-- if you want to take an action

978
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.090
to investigate, you'll probably find the footprints.

979
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.610
TRAVIS: I do not. I charge ahead blindly.

980
00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.715
SAM: That's the first track off your album, right?

981
00:38:43.715 --> 00:38:47.056
TRAVIS: (singing) Footprints in the dust!

982
00:38:47.056 --> 00:38:51.051
Sunsets in my mind!

983
00:38:51.051 --> 00:38:52.200
Onward.

984
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.268
MATT: All right, so you go charging down the hallway.

985
00:38:54.268 --> 00:38:58.670
30 feet. You keep moving beyond that?

986
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.010
TRAVIS: Is there more to get to the junction where?

987
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.390
MATT: It curves to the right about 20 feet ahead of you.

988
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:04.500
If you use your action to dash,

989
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.900
you'll be able to just turn around the corner.

990
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.680
TRAVIS: I don't see anything, but I'm just going to go ahead

991
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.260
and go "Uh!" and fire two Eldritch Blasts down the hallway.

992
00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.976
MATT: Go ahead and make two attacks with disadvantage.

993
00:39:15.976 --> 00:39:17.117
First one is?

994
00:39:17.117 --> 00:39:17.950
TRAVIS: That is balls

995
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.210
because that's a 12.

996
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.940
MATT: 12, hits the nearby stone, no impact.

997
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.470
The other?

998
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.530
TRAVIS: Oh, the second one is an 18.

999
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.120
MATT: An 18. I need you to roll a D6 for me.

1000
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.420
One to three, it hits the creature.

1001
00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.560
On a four to six, it hits Nott.

1002
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.793
TRAVIS: Two.
MATT: Hits the creature.

1003
00:39:36.793 --> 00:39:38.768
(cheering)

1004
00:39:38.768 --> 00:39:40.730
MATT: As you were firing blindly into a tunnel

1005
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.390
in the direction of two invisible creatures.

1006
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.398
Lucky you, and suddenly (explosion).

1007
00:39:45.398 --> 00:39:48.880
You see some dust stumble on the ground.

1008
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.130
How much damage does it take?

1009
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:53.948
TRAVIS: It is 11 points of Eldritch Blast.

1010
00:39:56.087 --> 00:39:58.166
MATT: 11 points of Eldritch Blast.

1011
00:39:58.166 --> 00:40:02.704
All right, you hear (grunting).

1012
00:40:02.704 --> 00:40:05.130
That's as much as you make out.

1013
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.443
You hear it loudly to the left of you.

1014
00:40:07.443 --> 00:40:08.900
Like ten feet behind, you see this flash

1015
00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.610
of eldritch energy from the impact

1016
00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.520
of one of Fjord's attacks, and you just hear

1017
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.130
this growling, grumpy sound.

1018
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.868
That does bring us to Caduceus' go.

1019
00:40:19.868 --> 00:40:24.868
TALIESIN: I'm going to 30 feet ahead, again.

1020
00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:27.047
MATT: All righty.

1021
00:40:27.047 --> 00:40:29.460
LAURA: You have to duck under that arch, though.

1022
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.421
TALIESIN: I do have to duck.

1023
00:40:30.421 --> 00:40:31.970
LAURA: You're so tall.

1024
00:40:32.928 --> 00:40:34.345
MATT: Actually, no, you can probably move through Yasha

1025
00:40:34.345 --> 00:40:36.761
and get up to there, we'll say.

1026
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:38.397
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't want to leave too many stragglers

1027
00:40:38.397 --> 00:40:39.950
behind, so that'll do.

1028
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:43.720
MATT: All right, that finishes your go, Caduceus. Nott.

1029
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.186
SAM: First I will say:

1030
00:40:47.186 --> 00:40:51.065
(weakly) Fjord. Why did you kill me?

1031
00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:54.448
(laughter)

1032
00:40:54.448 --> 00:40:56.695
Then I'll continue forward.

1033
00:40:56.695 --> 00:41:00.770
TRAVIS: Oh no. Nott, Nott?

1034
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.880
TALIESIN: Actually, while I was running by Yasha,

1035
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.320
I would love to cast Resistance on Yasha.

1036
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.396
MATT: Okay, fair enough, you got it.

1037
00:41:07.396 --> 00:41:09.100
LAURA: What's the name of these creatures, do we know?

1038
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.080
MATT: Make a religion check for me.

1039
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.720
LAURA: Ooh, an 18.

1040
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.240
MATT: 18.

1041
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.822
Looking at their physicality, their emotion,

1042
00:41:19.822 --> 00:41:22.756
they are quasits.
LAURA: Quasits.

1043
00:41:22.756 --> 00:41:25.720
MATT: Very, very, very, very lower end fiends.

1044
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.700
LAURA: I'll write "quasit chunks" in my bag.

1045
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.361
MATT: Yes, quasit chunks, put that down.

1046
00:41:30.361 --> 00:41:33.027
TRAVIS: Take my spurs, but not my goblin girl!

1047
00:41:33.027 --> 00:41:36.921
(laughter)

1048
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:39.445
TRAVIS: Cry out, Nott! Cry out!

1049
00:41:39.445 --> 00:41:41.080
MATT: All right.
SAM: I'm going to continue

1050
00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.490
and use my action to-- is there, what is the surface

1051
00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:46.660
of the walls?
MATT: As you curve around,

1052
00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.710
it's a continuation of this tunnel,

1053
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.330
it dips down a little bit, and it continues forward,

1054
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.410
and it opens out into a chamber

1055
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.850
about 80 feet ahead of you.

1056
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.420
SAM: It'll take all my action dash and bonus

1057
00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.730
to get to the--
MATT: To get to the front,

1058
00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.230
like the mouth of that chamber.

1059
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.113
Right now, you can just barely see

1060
00:42:03.113 --> 00:42:04.229
at the limitations of your darkvision.

1061
00:42:04.229 --> 00:42:05.920
If you start moving forward, you begin to see the tunnel

1062
00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.707
creep open and open.

1063
00:42:07.707 --> 00:42:09.370
SAM: I'll get to the mouth of the thing.

1064
00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:10.808
Wherever it may be.

1065
00:42:10.808 --> 00:42:12.528
MATT: You got it.

1066
00:42:12.528 --> 00:42:16.300
You get up to there, and I'll get to your description

1067
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.390
there in just a second.

1068
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.223
Yasha?

1069
00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:20.723
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha runs past Fjord

1070
00:42:20.723 --> 00:42:23.200
and slams him in the shoulder,

1071
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.850
since she thinks Fjord killed Nott.

1072
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.750
She just looks around as she see anything?

1073
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.070
MATT: Make an action to do a perception check.

1074
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.470
TRAVIS: Okay.

1075
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:36.820
That's a 12.

1076
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.540
MATT: She does not see anything, unfortunately.

1077
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.664
TRAVIS: That's it. Her rage drops.

1078
00:42:41.664 --> 00:42:42.820
MATT: Jester.

1079
00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.900
LAURA: I guess I'll stuff the pieces in my bag.

1080
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.450
And start skipping

1081
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.790
down the hallway to meet up with everybody else.

1082
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.490
SAM: We're having three different encounters here.

1083
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.815
I'm on a different map.

1084
00:42:54.815 --> 00:42:57.665
You're at butchery class.

1085
00:42:57.665 --> 00:42:58.823
TALIESIN: Farming, man.

1086
00:42:58.823 --> 00:43:00.173
MATT: Yeah, standard.

1087
00:43:00.173 --> 00:43:02.981
MARISHA: Fjord's having a mental breakdown.

1088
00:43:02.981 --> 00:43:03.820
TRAVIS: Oh god!

1089
00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.140
MATT: All righty, finish Jester's go, Caleb.

1090
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.710
LIAM: I'm just going to watch Jester skip away,

1091
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.890
look down at all the blood and gore on the ground,

1092
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.730
throw a Fire Bolt at the gore

1093
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.950
to dry it out, and that's the end of my turn.

1094
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.880
MATT: Okay, stay put?
LIAM: Yeah.

1095
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.750
MATT: Burst of flame and you hear the sizzling

1096
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.830
of whatever fiendish flesh was left behind

1097
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.590
in that small puddle. It boils into this like

1098
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.030
black thick tar-like substance is left behind

1099
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.481
after the flame dies down into a slow--

1100
00:43:33.481 --> 00:43:38.097
LIAM: One last thing. (gags)

1101
00:43:38.097 --> 00:43:41.488
MATT: Okay, cool, that's Caleb's turn. Beau.

1102
00:43:41.488 --> 00:43:45.900
MARISHA: I'm going to move forward as well towards--

1103
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.110
MATT: Okay.

1104
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.210
We'll say for the purposes of this,

1105
00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.070
since the creature is not visible,

1106
00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:52.907
and at this point, everyone seems to have lost

1107
00:43:52.907 --> 00:43:55.350
visual on where it may be,

1108
00:43:55.350 --> 00:44:00.290
the encounter itself is no longer a combat encounter.

1109
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:04.265
As such, we are now

1110
00:44:04.265 --> 00:44:06.872
out of combat.

1111
00:44:06.872 --> 00:44:08.605
TRAVIS: Should we check that hallway for special shit?

1112
00:44:08.605 --> 00:44:09.644
LAURA: Probably.

1113
00:44:09.644 --> 00:44:11.660
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, yeah.

1114
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.260
It also means--

1115
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.430
SAM: (like Fjord) Special shit.

1116
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:20.430
MATT: A brief burst of intense, quick,

1117
00:44:20.447 --> 00:44:23.230
not necessarily dangerous combat, but a curious encounter

1118
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.841
with three creatures,

1119
00:44:24.841 --> 00:44:27.410
one of which seems to have gotten away.

1120
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.060
You all take a moment to look amongst

1121
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.010
yourselves to see who's okay.

1122
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.990
Nott is still nowhere to be seen.

1123
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:34.700
LAURA: What happened to Nott?

1124
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.340
LIAM: Pull out the wire.

1125
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.190
Nott, can you hear me? We do not know where you are.

1126
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.758
Do you have a plan. What are you doing?

1127
00:44:39.758 --> 00:44:42.240
TRAVIS: She's wounded! I think I hit her.

1128
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.355
LIAM: You can reply to this message.

1129
00:44:44.355 --> 00:44:48.780
SAM: Just tell Fjord that he killed me.

1130
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:51.840
LIAM: Fjord, Nott wants you to know that she's dead,

1131
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.324
that you killed her.

1132
00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.641
TRAVIS: She wants--?
MARISHA: Wait, can you talk

1133
00:44:55.641 --> 00:44:58.570
to people beyond the grave now?

1134
00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:02.420
TRAVIS: Little shit. Nott! Nott!

1135
00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.280
MATT: You hear them, like an echo behind you in the hallway.

1136
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.630
SAM: I will cast Message to Fjord.

1137
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.970
(eerily) It's me.

1138
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.685
From beyond the veil.

1139
00:45:13.685 --> 00:45:14.785
TRAVIS: No!

1140
00:45:14.785 --> 00:45:17.275
SAM: You can reply to this message.

1141
00:45:17.275 --> 00:45:18.916
TRAVIS: Double dash out the tunnel.

1142
00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:20.500
(yelling)

1143
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.770
MATT: You go charging back as Jester's walking by

1144
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.590
with this large-- her bright pink colored handy

1145
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.458
haversack she had made is now just splattered

1146
00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.370
with like thick purple blood.

1147
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:31.203
LAURA: Where are you going?

1148
00:45:31.203 --> 00:45:33.317
TRAVIS: (horrified startled sounds)

1149
00:45:33.317 --> 00:45:36.040
LAURA: I got snacks.
TRAVIS: Stacks of what?

1150
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.521
LAURA: Snacks.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1151
00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:41.895
LAURA: It's-a called a quasit.

1152
00:45:41.895 --> 00:45:43.761
TRAVIS: It's-a called a quasit?

1153
00:45:43.761 --> 00:45:46.361
(laughter)

1154
00:45:46.361 --> 00:45:47.647
LAURA: Yeah.

1155
00:45:47.647 --> 00:45:50.030
That's what we were fighting.
TRAVIS: Okay.

1156
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.530
TRAVIS: Snacks for who, Jester?

1157
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.021
LAURA: For Yarnball.

1158
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.960
TRAVIS: Nice.

1159
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.920
You don't need any help carrying that, right?

1160
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.460
LAURA: Would I know if that's okay for Yarnball to eat?

1161
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.018
MATT: Make a nature check.

1162
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.730
LAURA: Ooh.

1163
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:09.920
17.

1164
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.840
MATT: 17.

1165
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.838
You have had no previous knowledge of moorbounders existing.

1166
00:46:15.838 --> 00:46:17.780
From what time you've interacted with them,

1167
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.347
they seem fairly hardy creatures that are adapted to

1168
00:46:20.347 --> 00:46:23.350
the harsh environments of Xhorhas.

1169
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.956
You also know that Xhorhas, based on its historical

1170
00:46:25.956 --> 00:46:30.956
nature has long been assaulted and home

1171
00:46:30.987 --> 00:46:32.890
to a number of fiendish creatures and forces

1172
00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:36.370
left over from the Calamity, so it's possible.

1173
00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:38.620
LAURA: I think Yarnball will really like it.

1174
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.940
TRAVIS: Can't wait to find out. Shall we join the others?

1175
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.850
LIAM: I walk past them and pull the wire back up

1176
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:45.710
and say: Nott, what is the play here?

1177
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.173
What are you doing? Are you scouting ahead?

1178
00:46:48.173 --> 00:46:49.989
SAM: I'll tell you exactly what I see.

1179
00:46:49.989 --> 00:46:53.406
MATT: First off, make a perception check for me.

1180
00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:55.897
SAM: Six.

1181
00:46:55.897 --> 00:46:58.682
(laughter)

1182
00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.860
SAM: Tip of the spear.

1183
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.790
MATT: So.

1184
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:03.452
Sitting there at the mouth of this--

1185
00:47:03.452 --> 00:47:04.867
TRAVIS: Who built this rogue?!

1186
00:47:04.867 --> 00:47:07.317
MATT: This cavern opening.

1187
00:47:07.317 --> 00:47:08.583
TRAVIS: Wise? Fuck it.

1188
00:47:08.583 --> 00:47:10.160
SAM: I took all my perception points

1189
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.877
and put them into drinking.

1190
00:47:12.877 --> 00:47:14.135
MATT: Priorities.

1191
00:47:14.135 --> 00:47:15.585
LIAM: Same.

1192
00:47:15.585 --> 00:47:16.418
MATT: So.

1193
00:47:16.418 --> 00:47:21.280
It opens up both ways into this oddly curved cavern,

1194
00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.280
this space that widens and then curves around about

1195
00:47:26.423 --> 00:47:31.423
80 to 100 feet side to side, with a large cylindrical rock

1196
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:33.330
that sits in the center like a pillar.

1197
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:35.670
It seems like two tunnels that curve around.

1198
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:36.870
What might have been an open chamber,

1199
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:38.260
but there is a central pillar

1200
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:43.182
of natural rock that sits to blockade the central portion

1201
00:47:43.182 --> 00:47:44.317
of this chamber.

1202
00:47:44.317 --> 00:47:46.130
Immediately in front of you, you see

1203
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.220
an area where some of the rock is pulled away

1204
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.900
and there is a little pool of water.

1205
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.450
Maybe about 25 feet across with rocks

1206
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:54.570
and various other stalagmites piercing through

1207
00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:55.740
from underneath.

1208
00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:00.610
The entire interior looks like a creepy jaw

1209
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.030
of some massive creature with the number of

1210
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:03.620
stalactites and stalagmites that all

1211
00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.030
intersecting and pressing against each other

1212
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:08.770
and meeting to where it looks like this

1213
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:12.521
frightening wide maw of tiny dagger-like teeth.

1214
00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:15.380
It is a natural cavern.

1215
00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.880
You can only see

1216
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.720
to where it begins to,

1217
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.490
both sides of it curve around,

1218
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.590
and then vanish ahead into darkness.

1219
00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:29.170
SAM: I describe all this and keep going.

1220
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:30.601
MATT: Okay.

1221
00:48:30.601 --> 00:48:31.818
You guys all hanging back while Nott continues

1222
00:48:31.818 --> 00:48:34.041
to scout?
LIAM: Do you want us

1223
00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:36.880
to keep a safe distance or what would you like us to do?

1224
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.182
SAM: Just in case, stay.

1225
00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:43.699
LAURA and SAM: (singing) Stay-yay-yay.

1226
00:48:43.699 --> 00:48:45.128
TRAVIS: (singing) Stay the night!

1227
00:48:45.128 --> 00:48:46.736
SAM: I'm going to go left.

1228
00:48:46.736 --> 00:48:51.050
Stay at the mouth of the room until you hear further.

1229
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:52.458
LIAM: She wants to have a look around,

1230
00:48:52.458 --> 00:48:53.399
we are going to hang back.

1231
00:48:53.399 --> 00:48:55.182
She is going left, come on.

1232
00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:56.780
MARISHA: Remind her that I can punch ghosts.

1233
00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.620
LIAM: I'm not going to do that. Then I walk forward.

1234
00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.898
TRAVIS: Is there anything about these tunnels that looks

1235
00:49:00.898 --> 00:49:03.790
like they were dug or is there anything

1236
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.916
embedded in the walls?

1237
00:49:05.916 --> 00:49:07.773
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1238
00:49:07.773 --> 00:49:09.210
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
LIAM: Roll us another three.

1239
00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.325
MATT: Well, here, actually no. Make a perception check.

1240
00:49:12.325 --> 00:49:14.779
TRAVIS: No, investigation's better!

1241
00:49:14.779 --> 00:49:17.120
MATT: You're checking the walls...

1242
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.161
Investigation or perception,

1243
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:20.281
your choice. Both will get you different information.

1244
00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:22.039
SAM: If only there was a Handbooker Helper--

1245
00:49:22.039 --> 00:49:22.881
TRAVIS: 24.

1246
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:24.897
SAM: -- about this very topic.

1247
00:49:24.897 --> 00:49:26.369
MARISHA: So topical!

1248
00:49:26.369 --> 00:49:28.780
TRAVIS: I'm investigating our surroundings.

1249
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.520
MATT: Where the two creatures were on the wall,

1250
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.030
where they were scratching their claws,

1251
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.770
you go over and take a brief look at the grooves

1252
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:39.043
that they've been grinding into the stone.

1253
00:49:39.043 --> 00:49:43.123
It would seem to resemble some sort of

1254
00:49:43.123 --> 00:49:46.450
a scratching post, but if you look closely,

1255
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.702
there's a pattern to their scratching.

1256
00:49:48.702 --> 00:49:50.890
There are a number of

1257
00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.470
points of scratching across the wall in this region.

1258
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.640
They're each about a foot apart from each other,

1259
00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.600
and there seems to be an implicit design to them.

1260
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.433
LAURA: Oh.

1261
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.867
TRAVIS: Hey, hey, hey, guys, fellers.

1262
00:50:04.867 --> 00:50:07.540
Ladies.

1263
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.380
You know, where those things were scratching,

1264
00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.910
it looks like there's a little bit of a pattern up here.

1265
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:14.430
LAURA: Like what, like runes or like words or something

1266
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:15.510
or like drawings?

1267
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.018
TRAVIS: No, I mean, I don't know about any of that,

1268
00:50:17.018 --> 00:50:19.370
it just seems like a little, you know, repetitive.

1269
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:22.870
They seem to be a certain distance from each other.

1270
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:25.060
LIAM: Does it appear to be a language of some kind?

1271
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:25.893
MATT: It may.

1272
00:50:25.893 --> 00:50:29.740
MARISHA: Does it appear to be a cant?

1273
00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:33.187
LAURA: Does it appear to be dicks?

1274
00:50:33.187 --> 00:50:35.030
MATT: Your dick sense

1275
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.880
does not tell you that these are phallic in design

1276
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.946
in any way.

1277
00:50:38.946 --> 00:50:42.190
You can make an arcana check if you'd like, Caleb.

1278
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.845
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Dick sense.

1279
00:50:43.845 --> 00:50:44.678
SAM: Once per day.

1280
00:50:44.678 --> 00:50:45.604
MATT: It's a very special paladin oath you've got to take

1281
00:50:45.604 --> 00:50:46.847
for that one.

1282
00:50:48.264 --> 00:50:49.860
LIAM: That is a 27.

1283
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.320
MATT: 27, okay.

1284
00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.210
You know exactly what these are.

1285
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:56.250
Only because of your research and studying.

1286
00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:00.638
The basis of these glyphs is Abyssal.

1287
00:51:00.638 --> 00:51:05.070
They are what are called anchor glyphs.

1288
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:10.070
They are designed to be the basis of larger gates.

1289
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:13.520
When permanent enchantments are developed and designed

1290
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.378
to instill longterm doorways

1291
00:51:17.378 --> 00:51:20.440
between planes, realms.

1292
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.190
Even some of the more rudimentary teleportation circles,

1293
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:25.320
and you catch this because you've recently found

1294
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.635
a spell of a similar type incantation.

1295
00:51:27.635 --> 00:51:29.550
You can catch the similarities,

1296
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:33.440
that this is on a larger and more ancient scale.

1297
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.910
Not completed, by any means, but you can see

1298
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:38.720
the beginnings of what is the groundwork being laid

1299
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.960
for a larger doorway.

1300
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.657
LIAM: That was my question.

1301
00:51:41.657 --> 00:51:43.570
They were a bit of a gate construction crew

1302
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:44.940
and we stopped them mid--

1303
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.148
MATT: You could interpret that as a possibility, yeah.

1304
00:51:49.148 --> 00:51:50.870
LIAM: Well, I relay that to everyone.

1305
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:53.370
TRAVIS; Yasha reads Abyssal, but these are runes?

1306
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:54.890
More like symbols?
MATT: Yeah.

1307
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.180
LIAM: Abyssal in nature.
MATT: Yeah.

1308
00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.620
MATT: As you say this, Yasha walks up and goes,

1309
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.699
"Yeah, it's Abyssal."

1310
00:52:01.699 --> 00:52:03.449
LIAM: What does it say?

1311
00:52:03.449 --> 00:52:07.790
MATT: "It's not really a language. It's just the letters."

1312
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.400
LAURA: Should we scratch them out or something

1313
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.042
so that it doesn't work?

1314
00:52:11.042 --> 00:52:12.070
LIAM: That's a good idea.

1315
00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:14.930
TALIESIN: Maybe Yasha's sword might be the tool for that.

1316
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:16.346
LAURA: Oh, yeah, because she can Dispel

1317
00:52:16.346 --> 00:52:17.462
at the same time, right?

1318
00:52:17.462 --> 00:52:18.992
MARISHA: Because I'm pretty sure this has got to be

1319
00:52:18.992 --> 00:52:21.000
rooted in magic, right?

1320
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.505
TRAVIS: Somebody want to check that?

1321
00:52:22.505 --> 00:52:24.679
LIAM: Are these giving anything off, Cad?

1322
00:52:24.679 --> 00:52:26.160
TALIESIN: It'll be my only check of the evening,

1323
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.490
but might as well do that.

1324
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.670
I'm going to Detect Magic.

1325
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:32.690
MATT: Okay, you Detect Magic.

1326
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:36.910
You do not sense any magical aura from these runes.

1327
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.040
Based on your findings and your understanding

1328
00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.321
of the way they've been carved in,

1329
00:52:41.321 --> 00:52:44.120
no incantation has been completed.

1330
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.690
This was essentially the very first step

1331
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:49.850
in building what was intended to be placed here.

1332
00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.800
LIAM: I think we could just rely on brute force

1333
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.480
and not--
MATT: You get about halfway

1334
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.702
through that sentence before Yasha is now grinding

1335
00:52:56.702 --> 00:52:59.340
across the stone work.
TRAVIS: Whoa, hey, whoa!

1336
00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.370
TRAVIS: Maybe we should leave it as evidence in case we need

1337
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:03.790
to prove that there was some sort of an entrance, right?

1338
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:05.930
MARISHA: We do have to take something back to--

1339
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:07.460
TALIESIN: A little bit of damage, there's no harm.

1340
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.630
LAURA: So that, you know, it can't be completed,

1341
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.683
but we will definitely--

1342
00:53:11.683 --> 00:53:12.516
TRAVIS: Maybe we can carve out a section of it,

1343
00:53:12.516 --> 00:53:14.550
throw it in the old bag of holding.

1344
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:16.400
LIAM: Single glyph on a fragment of stone?

1345
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.188
LAURA: Like a stalactite

1346
00:53:18.188 --> 00:53:21.040
or anything that we could cut off or something

1347
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.464
with a symbol on it?

1348
00:53:22.464 --> 00:53:25.550
MATT: There's not embedded in stalactites.

1349
00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:28.290
They're more on the wall edges

1350
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.310
of the actual tunnel.

1351
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:31.380
It looks like they were forming an archway, essentially,

1352
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.720
with these runes.

1353
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.742
And after Yasha, Yasha says like,

1354
00:53:35.742 --> 00:53:39.830
"Carving it out's a little bit beyond my capabilities

1355
00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:41.488
"with a sword."

1356
00:53:41.488 --> 00:53:45.300
MARISHA: I take a piece of paper from my journal

1357
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.750
and I take some charcoal and I put it up against there

1358
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:49.510
and I--
MATT: Ooh, and do a rub, nice.

1359
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.740
Okay.

1360
00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.663
Using that, a few different places.

1361
00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:56.937
MARISHA: Art class, elementary school!

1362
00:53:56.937 --> 00:54:00.281
MATT: There it is, five seconds, you got it.

1363
00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:03.721
MARISHA: I didn't trust it.

1364
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:05.600
TRAVIS: I don't know why, it's not like Travis presents

1365
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.960
himself as an untrustworthy fucker.

1366
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.771
TRAVIS: Pitfalls of friendship.

1367
00:54:09.771 --> 00:54:10.971
MARISHA: Control!

1368
00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.803
MATT: I'd say within a minute you have

1369
00:54:14.803 --> 00:54:18.620
charcoal rubbings of six or seven

1370
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.550
of the different glyphs on the wall.

1371
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.790
There are some that are repeated.

1372
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:26.370
You get at least six or seven individual glyphs.

1373
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.600
MARISHA: Cool.

1374
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.870
MATT: Do you wish to continue to destroy any of them?

1375
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:33.750
TRAVIS: I think we're good.

1376
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.770
LIAM: I think we should destroy all of them.

1377
00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:36.660
TRAVIS: Well, I think we should destroy all of them.

1378
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.660
LAURA: I'm going to use my axe to just hit a couple of them.

1379
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.150
MATT: Does anyone have any sort of chisels or tools?

1380
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.660
LIAM: I pull out a small clay cat's paw

1381
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.300
and cast Maximilian's Earthen Grasp,

1382
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.050
and a giant cat's hand extends out of the stone wall

1383
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.550
and starts dragging all along the edges of it.

1384
00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.880
MATT: This large like stone behemoth type

1385
00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.290
cat claw carves out of the wall.

1386
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:02.120
As it pushes up through the stone,

1387
00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.180
you hear the cracking and binding and the pressure

1388
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.340
that is sundering the element of the earth

1389
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.620
that is crumbling and leaving stones

1390
00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.630
and pebbles behind in its wake.

1391
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:14.820
In its path, all of the runes, as it goes around

1392
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.680
from the floor to ceiling to floor,

1393
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.640
are dashed and left completely unrecognizable.

1394
00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.590
SAM: Wow.

1395
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.421
TALIESIN: That'll do it.
TRAVIS: Meow.

1396
00:55:22.421 --> 00:55:25.160
LAURA: Is the rest of the cat like in the rock?

1397
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.827
Where is it?

1398
00:55:26.827 --> 00:55:29.810
LIAM: The rest of the cat is in my heart.

1399
00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.701
LAURA: So you've got a big heart.

1400
00:55:33.709 --> 00:55:34.830
LIAM: Hmm.

1401
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:37.138
MATT: While this is happening, Nott.

1402
00:55:37.138 --> 00:55:38.460
SAM: Ahh!

1403
00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.540
MATT: Which way are you going, right or left?

1404
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:41.343
SAM: Left.

1405
00:55:41.343 --> 00:55:42.790
MATT: You head left.

1406
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.430
You maneuver through the darkness.

1407
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.600
Quietly, ever so quietly.

1408
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.010
You come around the edge and you can see

1409
00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:50.840
there's other strange pieces of stone

1410
00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.510
that are pushing out of the topography of the ground here

1411
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:55.810
as you curve around the left side.

1412
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:58.850
There's clusters of stalagmites everywhere

1413
00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:01.510
and the ground here is actually hard to move

1414
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:03.731
through in places. It's wider and in some cases

1415
00:56:03.731 --> 00:56:07.763
more pinched based on how heavy the clusters

1416
00:56:07.763 --> 00:56:11.020
of the natural stone formations fill

1417
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.550
the space around you.

1418
00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.430
It creates, as you move through here,

1419
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:15.850
I mean, there are no shadows because there's no light,

1420
00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:20.250
but it creates this path you have to follow

1421
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.650
to really make it through.

1422
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.822
As you push around the left side and go around the corner,

1423
00:56:23.822 --> 00:56:27.150
this is a loop. You can see now it begins to turn around

1424
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.721
and would seem to gather with the opposite end

1425
00:56:29.721 --> 00:56:32.630
where you came through, but you see nothing.

1426
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:34.870
You don't make any

1427
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.523
visual contact with anything that catches your eye.

1428
00:56:37.523 --> 00:56:40.323
You continue around and eventually return back

1429
00:56:40.323 --> 00:56:41.640
to where you began.

1430
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.410
SAM: I'll go, if they're still fucking off back there,

1431
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.130
I'll go check out the pool of water.

1432
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.340
MATT: Okay.

1433
00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.880
You step up to the edge of the pool of water.

1434
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.093
It is still. It is unmoving.

1435
00:56:54.093 --> 00:56:58.860
The smell coming off of it is not pleasant.

1436
00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.106
It's stagnant.

1437
00:57:02.106 --> 00:57:07.089
It has a musky, heavy bacterial smell to it.

1438
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.480
You can't really see below the surface.

1439
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.690
You don't know how deep it is.

1440
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.710
It's maybe about five to ten feet across at points

1441
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.720
and is clustered in a half moon shape

1442
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.670
around the base of where the edges of the tunnel

1443
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:21.020
meet to fill that central pillar.

1444
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.688
SAM: Nothing behind it, right, like?

1445
00:57:23.688 --> 00:57:24.690
MATT: Nothing that you can--

1446
00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:26.680
SAM: Behind it is like the pillar, right?

1447
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.870
MATT: Yeah, where the two tunnels go around,

1448
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:30.630
there's that central space where the rock

1449
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:33.080
is blocking what would be an open chamber.

1450
00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.750
It's affixed to the base of that.

1451
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.130
SAM: Oh, I see.
LAURA: Would you say it smells

1452
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:40.550
similar to the liquid inside of Scanlan's mug?

1453
00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:45.550
MATT: Worse, no, nothing can be worse than that. Comparable.

1454
00:57:45.982 --> 00:57:48.470
SAM:: All right, hmm.

1455
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:51.060
I'll just check around for traps.

1456
00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.420
Because I'm not going in without them.

1457
00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:57.725
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a

1458
00:57:57.725 --> 00:57:59.775
Perception Check for this one.

1459
00:57:59.775 --> 00:58:00.942
You're just looking around a natural space--

1460
00:58:00.942 --> 00:58:03.968
SAM: 16.
MATT: All righty.

1461
00:58:03.968 --> 00:58:06.595
MATT: You glance around in the immediate vicinity of the

1462
00:58:06.595 --> 00:58:08.490
base of this pool and around the entranceway

1463
00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:10.960
and nothing catches your attention.

1464
00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.720
It's a pretty natural cavern.

1465
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.810
SAM: Up, anything up?

1466
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.830
MATT: Looking up, you don't see any traps hanging above.

1467
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:21.063
Nothing.

1468
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:26.720
SAM: Caleb, it's a dead end here and there's water,

1469
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.523
I can't go in, I need you, come.

1470
00:58:28.523 --> 00:58:30.281
LIAM: Okay, coming.

1471
00:58:30.281 --> 00:58:31.816
TALIESIN: Are we moving?

1472
00:58:31.816 --> 00:58:36.816
LIAM: Nott is-- hold a second, and I will walk carefully.

1473
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:38.681
I will stealth up.

1474
00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.730
MATT: Yeah, make a stealth check for me, please.

1475
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:41.321
LAURA: I can see you.

1476
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:44.170
(laughter)

1477
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.010
LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18. Okay.

1478
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.151
TALIESIN: I can definitely see you.

1479
00:58:48.151 --> 00:58:50.330
MATT: Cool. So.

1480
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:52.441
As you move up around the corner,

1481
00:58:52.441 --> 00:58:56.133
head down into the interior.

1482
00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.540
You don't see anybody.

1483
00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.260
LIAM: I take out the wire.

1484
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:04.900
(whispers) Nott, what part of this chamber are you in?

1485
00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.750
SAM: The water part.

1486
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:09.130
Right in front of you.

1487
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:12.150
I'm waving my hand, can't you see me?

1488
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:14.895
I'm literally jumping up and down.

1489
00:59:14.895 --> 00:59:17.600
LIAM: What do you want to do?

1490
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.382
SAM: (louder) Hey, I'm over here!

1491
00:59:20.382 --> 00:59:23.520
(grating) Follow my voice.

1492
00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.880
LIAM: (laughing) I walk over to the sound of the voice.

1493
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.020
MATT: Okay, you walk over and the smell of the water

1494
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.483
catches you. It's wafting up from the pool.

1495
00:59:32.483 --> 00:59:34.340
SAM: Where's everyone else?

1496
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.590
LIAM: I told them to wait a moment.

1497
00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.670
I'm scanning the room and looking myself for--

1498
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:39.678
SAM: No, you can't be here by yourself, you're

1499
00:59:39.678 --> 00:59:42.686
puny and weak. Oh, god.

1500
00:59:42.686 --> 00:59:43.800
LIAM: A gate, a door, what's happening?

1501
00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.740
TRAVIS: Oh no, oh no!

1502
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:50.300
SAM: Unsolicited whisper, D&amp;D Beyond, guys.

1503
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.470
They're looking for some new employees.

1504
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:55.500
You could work for the company that I'm about to run.

1505
00:59:55.500 --> 01:00:00.060
Therefore, you're applying for the job of being my minion.

1506
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.833
MARISHA: He's rolling.

1507
01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.059
SAM: He's rolling? What is happening?

1508
01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:08.170
There's a second game of D&amp;D going on back here.

1509
01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:11.645
LAURA: Are you going to be mind controlled?

1510
01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.980
What's going on?

1511
01:00:14.838 --> 01:00:16.198
LIAM: Wowie wee wow.

1512
01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:17.739
MATT: You don't, yeah.

1513
01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.360
What are you guys doing?

1514
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.193
TRAVIS: We're waiting because the wizard

1515
01:00:21.193 --> 01:00:23.201
told us to stay put.

1516
01:00:23.201 --> 01:00:24.900
SAM: Caleb, are you okay?

1517
01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.760
LIAM: So good.

1518
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.000
So good.

1519
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.500
SAM: Shouldn't we call the others?

1520
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.110
LIAM: That would be a 12 by the way.

1521
01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:32.850
MATT: Yes, I know.
LIAM: Okay, good.

1522
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:34.330
SAM: Should we call the others or?

1523
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.696
LIAM: No, we're good. I think we're all right.

1524
01:00:36.696 --> 01:00:37.529
I think this is--

1525
01:00:37.529 --> 01:00:39.530
SAM: Well, if you think we're okay, I guess we'll just

1526
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.140
wait here, then.
LIAM: Yeah.

1527
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.910
MATT: The rest of you guys?

1528
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:46.560
MARISHA: I'm going to do another scan of the cavern.

1529
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.110
MATT: Where you are?
MARISHA: Yeah.

1530
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.030
MARISHA: I'm going to just look for any like marks

1531
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.863
or identifying things.

1532
01:00:50.863 --> 01:00:51.696
MATT: Make a Perception check.

1533
01:00:51.696 --> 01:00:55.221
MARISHA: Were they trying to build roads,

1534
01:00:55.221 --> 01:00:56.820
underground tunnel system?

1535
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:59.310
Fucking shit.

1536
01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:00.280
Just perception?

1537
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.858
MATT: Perception or investigation, up to you.

1538
01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:03.691
MARISHA: I'll do investigation

1539
01:01:03.691 --> 01:01:05.770
because it's higher at a nine.

1540
01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:09.670
MATT: Okay. Looks like Fjord covered it.

1541
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.857
LAURA: How far away are they?

1542
01:01:12.857 --> 01:01:14.557
MATT: They're like, maybe 100 feet ahead of you guys.

1543
01:01:14.557 --> 01:01:16.052
LAURA: Can we see them?

1544
01:01:16.052 --> 01:01:17.200
MATT: No, there's no light source in there.

1545
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.901
SAM: Something's been bugging me, Caleb.

1546
01:01:18.901 --> 01:01:22.993
While we're alone, I figure now's as good a time as any.

1547
01:01:22.993 --> 01:01:25.452
I have a confession to make.

1548
01:01:25.452 --> 01:01:30.430
A while back, I wrote a letter to someone that you know.

1549
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.164
Astrid.

1550
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.280
Remember her?

1551
01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:45.160
Hello?

1552
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.300
You told me about her and I think maybe it was

1553
01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.400
a mistake in retrospect, but I wrote her a letter.

1554
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.069
I was hoping to maybe reconnect you, someone from your past

1555
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:57.827
might--I'm over here, by the way.

1556
01:01:59.077 --> 01:02:00.776
(laughter)

1557
01:02:00.776 --> 01:02:03.170
MATT: The rest of you, what are you doing?

1558
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:05.239
LAURA: How long do we have to wait, though?

1559
01:02:05.239 --> 01:02:07.780
MARISHA: They're the ones that can do the message stuff.

1560
01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.441
They both went together.

1561
01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:11.740
LIAM: You are telling me this--

1562
01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.681
SAM: More whispers!

1563
01:02:13.681 --> 01:02:15.423
LIAM: You are telling me this right now?

1564
01:02:15.423 --> 01:02:16.279
SAM: Well, I mean,

1565
01:02:16.279 --> 01:02:18.600
we're alone and there's obviously no danger around,

1566
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.600
so I figured right now would be a good time to tell you.

1567
01:02:24.043 --> 01:02:26.310
LIAM: Well, we will have this discussion later.

1568
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.530
For now, just get the rest up here and we will--

1569
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:31.230
SAM: Oh, you want me to get the rest.

1570
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:34.541
LIAM: Well, no, we can--everything's fine, come up.

1571
01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:37.100
TRAVIS: Oh, all right, we're going, we join.

1572
01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.380
LAURA: That was stupid, why'd we have to wait, then?

1573
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.962
TRAVIS: Nothing to worry about, huh? Coast is clear?

1574
01:02:41.962 --> 01:02:43.168
LAURA: Stomp stomp stomp.

1575
01:02:43.168 --> 01:02:44.530
TRAVIS: Seems strange only those three little buggers

1576
01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:45.605
would be the only thing--

1577
01:02:45.605 --> 01:02:47.838
LIAM: Nott is just getting strangely

1578
01:02:48.713 --> 01:02:50.220
personal and enigmatic.

1579
01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.430
SAM: I'm sorry, I just thought you should know.

1580
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:54.130
MATT: The rest of you guys are walking up

1581
01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:56.981
towards the entrance of this cavern,

1582
01:02:56.981 --> 01:02:59.440
with the light from Caduceus

1583
01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.060
opening the space. You can see across

1584
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:03.010
from the entrance way, where it opens up,

1585
01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:04.380
there's a little pool of water.

1586
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.250
You don't see Nott, because you're still invisible,

1587
01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:07.610
correct, but you see Caleb turn,

1588
01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:10.030
and looking towards you all with this

1589
01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:12.500
half cocked eyebrow, head

1590
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.300
tilted to the side slightly,

1591
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.758
in the back of your head, little voice just says,

1592
01:03:17.758 --> 01:03:19.975
"Light them up, pretty."

1593
01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:22.092
I need all of you guys to roll a dexterity saving throws.

1594
01:03:22.092 --> 01:03:24.258
Caleb lifts a hand and casts Fireball

1595
01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:27.419
right on the front entranceway, where you're all standing.

1596
01:03:27.419 --> 01:03:29.641
MARISHA: (yelling)

1597
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:31.220
LAURA: I don't want to roll.

1598
01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.970
MARISHA: A dex saving throw?

1599
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:34.848
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

1600
01:03:34.848 --> 01:03:35.814
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1601
01:03:35.814 --> 01:03:36.906
LIAM: Yeah, I let it go.

1602
01:03:36.906 --> 01:03:39.706
That's a fourth level, too, so that is--

1603
01:03:39.706 --> 01:03:43.040
LAURA: Oh no. I didn't roll high enough.

1604
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.570
TALIESIN: Dex save?
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

1605
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.653
TALIESIN: Do you have the node? Who has the node?

1606
01:03:47.653 --> 01:03:49.291
LAURA: I don't remember who has the node.

1607
01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:51.901
I think I have the node! I'm going to roll again.

1608
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:53.847
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: Three for me.

1609
01:03:53.847 --> 01:03:55.674
MATT: Failure.
TRAVIS: 20 for Yasha total.

1610
01:03:55.674 --> 01:03:58.600
MATT: Yasha succeeds, she takes half damage. Beau.

1611
01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.056
MARISHA: 12.
MATT: Fail.

1612
01:04:00.056 --> 01:04:02.147
MARISHA: Half damage, though, because evasion.

1613
01:04:02.147 --> 01:04:03.210
MATT: Correct.

1614
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:04.232
LAURA: 14.

1615
01:04:04.232 --> 01:04:05.473
LIAM: I did too.

1616
01:04:05.473 --> 01:04:07.579
MATT: 14 does not succeed.

1617
01:04:07.579 --> 01:04:09.580
MATT: I'm pretty sure, Caleb, your DC is 16.

1618
01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:13.530
LIAM: 16 and I did it at 4th-level, and it is 34.

1619
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:16.741
MATT: So 34 points of fire damage to Fjord.

1620
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:19.000
12--no, sorry.

1621
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.300
TRAVIS: 16?
MATT: 16 points to Yasha.

1622
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.913
16 points to you, Beau.

1623
01:04:22.913 --> 01:04:25.610
34 points to you, Jester.

1624
01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:27.134
Caduceus, what'd you get?

1625
01:04:27.134 --> 01:04:29.420
TALIESIN: 34 points to me.
MATT: 34 points of damage.

1626
01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.161
I'll be right back with the battlefield.

1627
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:34.440
(yelling)

1628
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.225
MARISHA: Fuck!

1629
01:04:36.225 --> 01:04:37.921
LIAM: This is fucking rad!

1630
01:04:37.921 --> 01:04:39.707
TRAVIS: You fucked me up, man!

1631
01:04:39.707 --> 01:04:41.290
LAURA: Why did you have to make it 4th-level?!

1632
01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:43.461
He didn't tell you to make it 4th-level!

1633
01:04:43.461 --> 01:04:45.427
MARISHA: Yeah, why'd you do 4th-level?!

1634
01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:47.668
LIAM: Well, she did this really spooky sexy speech

1635
01:04:47.668 --> 01:04:49.001
in my ear.

1636
01:04:50.572 --> 01:04:53.221
MARISHA: Ooh, succubus bitch.

1637
01:04:54.338 --> 01:04:57.415
LAURA: If we die--
LIAM: That was awesome.

1638
01:04:57.415 --> 01:04:59.208
LAURA: --I'm going to be super pissed.

1639
01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:00.158
TRAVIS: Oh no.

1640
01:05:00.158 --> 01:05:00.991
MATT: Caleb, you were right here.

1641
01:05:00.991 --> 01:05:01.949
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

1642
01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:04.550
MATT: Nott, you are invisible

1643
01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:07.167
over here next to the water.

1644
01:05:11.134 --> 01:05:13.343
LAURA: Should I have rolled for Nugget?

1645
01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:14.869
LIAM: That was the surprise round, bitches.

1646
01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.370
MATT: You should roll for Nugget, yes.

1647
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:17.753
You're keeping your dog with you.

1648
01:05:17.753 --> 01:05:18.770
MARISHA: Fuck.

1649
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:19.750
SAM: Oh god.

1650
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.510
LAURA: Oh no, Nugget's dead.

1651
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.593
SAM: Hey, more food for the bounder.

1652
01:05:24.593 --> 01:05:25.534
LAURA: No!

1653
01:05:25.534 --> 01:05:27.535
MATT: How much fire damage is that to Nugget?

1654
01:05:27.535 --> 01:05:29.118
LIAM: It was 34 total.

1655
01:05:29.118 --> 01:05:30.784
LAURA: Nugget's dead!

1656
01:05:30.784 --> 01:05:32.734
MATT: Unconscious, at least.

1657
01:05:32.734 --> 01:05:33.867
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1658
01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:35.250
LAURA: You killed Nugget!

1659
01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.405
LIAM: Crispy critter.

1660
01:05:37.405 --> 01:05:40.160
MATT: I need you guys to roll initiative.

1661
01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.310
TRAVIS: Oh my god. What did you do?

1662
01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:44.800
LIAM: Was not ready for PvP.

1663
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.310
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

1664
01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:50.070
TALIESIN: Oh my god, that's terrible. Damn it, damn it.

1665
01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:51.654
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

1666
01:05:51.654 --> 01:05:53.518
LIAM: I rolled really average, guys.

1667
01:05:53.518 --> 01:05:54.825
LAURA: Like 25?

1668
01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:56.290
LIAM: 11, average.

1669
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:58.080
TALIESIN: Damn it, damn it, damn it.

1670
01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.380
TRAVIS: Shit.

1671
01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:00.570
Shit, shit, shit.

1672
01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:01.678
MATT: So.

1673
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:03.703
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1674
01:06:03.703 --> 01:06:05.193
TALIESIN: This is really not good.

1675
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.310
MATT: 25 to 20? All right.

1676
01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:11.260
SAM: Wait a second, wait.

1677
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.400
Because Nugget just went unconscious,

1678
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.636
does Liam go catatonic?

1679
01:06:18.966 --> 01:06:20.407
MATT: Liam didn't see it.

1680
01:06:20.407 --> 01:06:24.253
Nugget was behind the edge of the curvature.

1681
01:06:24.253 --> 01:06:26.737
Liam might; Caleb's fine.

1682
01:06:26.737 --> 01:06:28.315
TRAVIS: This is gorgeous, by the way.

1683
01:06:28.315 --> 01:06:30.495
MATT: Thank you.

1684
01:06:30.495 --> 01:06:32.900
So, 20 to 15.

1685
01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.390
TRAVIS: Yasha got an 18.
SAM: 17.

1686
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:37.391
MARISHA: 15.

1687
01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:39.457
MATT: Yasha, Nott.

1688
01:06:39.457 --> 01:06:41.510
Then Beau?

1689
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:42.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha, Nott, Beau.

1690
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.160
MATT: Got it, all right.

1691
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.530
15 to ten.

1692
01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:46.670
LAURA: 14.

1693
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:47.860
MATT: Is it 14?

1694
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:50.020
TRAVIS: Jester, Caleb.

1695
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.328
LIAM: Caleb at 11.

1696
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.650
MATT: And Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Nine.

1697
01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.245
Motherfucking nine.

1698
01:07:01.772 --> 01:07:03.207
MARISHA: Oh. Fjordy Fjord?

1699
01:07:03.207 --> 01:07:04.717
SAM: Is that Fjord or Yasha?

1700
01:07:04.717 --> 01:07:05.584
TRAVIS: Fjord got a two.

1701
01:07:05.584 --> 01:07:06.823
MATT: Fjord at the end.

1702
01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:08.753
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

1703
01:07:08.753 --> 01:07:11.490
TRAVIS: No initiative bonus.

1704
01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:14.750
MATT: At the top of the round.

1705
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.270
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Fuck.

1706
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:19.340
MARISHA: Was it, it was me and Percy who got,

1707
01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.565
oh, we got possessed last time.

1708
01:07:21.565 --> 01:07:25.690
MATT: Stepping out of the corner this way, Fjord,

1709
01:07:27.653 --> 01:07:32.355
previously what you saw was the male bugbear figure.

1710
01:07:32.355 --> 01:07:35.050
It was spectral earlier.

1711
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:37.260
It's now standing there, the faint pink skin,

1712
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.970
but now is more of a humanoid form.

1713
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:43.370
You can see ripped muscles,

1714
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:45.750
like an adonis of a male figure,

1715
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.700
with these glowing yellow eyes, sharpened teeth.

1716
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.307
These wings, leathery, folded behind the shoulders.

1717
01:07:51.307 --> 01:07:53.207
Steps around the corner and just goes--

1718
01:07:54.357 --> 01:07:55.850
and you hear in the back of your mind,

1719
01:07:55.850 --> 01:08:00.550
lips not moving, just voice go, "Join your friend, come on."

1720
01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:02.040
Make a wisdom saving throw.

1721
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.347
TRAVIS: Oh no.

1722
01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:06.092
LIAM: Join me, join me, Fjord.

1723
01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:08.777
TRAVIS: Seven.

1724
01:08:08.777 --> 01:08:10.070
LIAM: Yes!

1725
01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.680
LAURA: Oh no, we're going to die.

1726
01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.830
MATT: You feel the influence tug at you

1727
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:19.752
and this creature, this entity is everything.

1728
01:08:19.752 --> 01:08:23.085
Imagine what this thing and Uk'otoa could do together.

1729
01:08:23.085 --> 01:08:24.617
TRAVIS: Oh no.

1730
01:08:24.617 --> 01:08:25.858
MATT: You are charmed by it.

1731
01:08:25.858 --> 01:08:29.645
That brings us, that finishes--

1732
01:08:29.645 --> 01:08:33.143
he's going to dart back, out of view there.

1733
01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:36.265
LIAM: (whispering) Get Caduceus and complete the trio.

1734
01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.764
TRAVIS: We're in deep shit.

1735
01:08:39.764 --> 01:08:41.600
We're in deep fucking shit.

1736
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.650
MATT: That's all they got that go. Yasha's turn.

1737
01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:47.020
Yasha is now recovering from the blast of flame

1738
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.480
that just filled the interior of the cavern.

1739
01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:52.940
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1740
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:57.363
Yeah, Yasha will rush forward.

1741
01:08:58.268 --> 01:08:59.880
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20.

1742
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.230
She looks into the chamber.

1743
01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:03.710
She doesn't see anything.

1744
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:05.520
TRAVIS: Just Caleb and that's it, can't see anything else?

1745
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.110
MATT: Just Caleb, that's it.

1746
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:11.020
TRAVIS: She will run past to the left,

1747
01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.490
just fill out, next 20 feet.

1748
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:16.394
TALIESIN: We're not going to deal with the--

1749
01:09:16.394 --> 01:09:17.427
TRAVIS: Can't see it.

1750
01:09:17.427 --> 01:09:19.119
TALIESIN: Oh, I was talking about the wizard.

1751
01:09:19.119 --> 01:09:20.465
MATT: She doesn't know where it came from.

1752
01:09:20.465 --> 01:09:22.252
She was around the corner.

1753
01:09:22.252 --> 01:09:24.254
That's her movement. She has an action still.

1754
01:09:24.254 --> 01:09:26.187
TRAVIS: She would like to ragé.

1755
01:09:26.187 --> 01:09:27.277
MATT: Okay, rage is up.

1756
01:09:27.277 --> 01:09:30.285
TRAVIS: As a bonus and her action she--

1757
01:09:34.247 --> 01:09:37.280
she doesn't know Caleb is charmed.

1758
01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.550
She doesn't know anything.

1759
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.040
Could you dispel a charm if you have Dispel Magic?

1760
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.360
Could you dispel a charm on somebody?

1761
01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.340
SAM: You could try.

1762
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.887
TRAVIS: She doesn't know.

1763
01:09:45.887 --> 01:09:47.682
MATT: She has no idea. She has no idea what's going on.

1764
01:09:47.682 --> 01:09:49.048
TRAVIS: She'll hold her melee attack

1765
01:09:49.048 --> 01:09:50.131
if someone comes within range.

1766
01:09:50.131 --> 01:09:52.000
MATT: What was Yasha's initiative again?

1767
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:52.930
TRAVIS: 18.

1768
01:09:54.049 --> 01:09:58.200
MATT: So I'll say simultaneously, as Yasha comes around

1769
01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:03.200
the corner, there's just a hint of a red in the distance,

1770
01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:05.320
like back in this area.

1771
01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.720
She doesn't quite see the source of it,

1772
01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.020
she just sees a little--

1773
01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.585
TRAVIS: That would draw her attention.

1774
01:10:10.585 --> 01:10:12.055
MATT: Glance over in that direction.

1775
01:10:12.055 --> 01:10:13.658
She's holding her action you said?

1776
01:10:13.658 --> 01:10:14.833
TRAVIS: Holding her action

1777
01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:16.119
for someone to come within--

1778
01:10:16.119 --> 01:10:17.099
MATT: You got it.

1779
01:10:17.099 --> 01:10:18.086
That finishes the action, Nott, you're up.

1780
01:10:18.086 --> 01:10:19.792
You just watched your friend suddenly turn around

1781
01:10:19.792 --> 01:10:24.792
and burn all the rest of your allies in the tunnel.

1782
01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:29.390
SAM: I think I would assume that that is not normal

1783
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.198
behavior, although I'm not 100 percent sure.

1784
01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.470
With this guy, he's a little <i>woo</i> sometimes.

1785
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:41.740
Either way, I will try to take him out of the equation.

1786
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.120
I will, dropping invisibility, cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter

1787
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.030
at Caleb and try to charm him with a joke.

1788
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:55.650
Hey Caleb, how many Zemnians does it take

1789
01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:57.620
to light a lantern?

1790
01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.630
One, they're efficient and humorless.

1791
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:01.520
That's it.

1792
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:04.486
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

1793
01:11:04.486 --> 01:11:05.686
LIAM: What do I have to beat?

1794
01:11:05.686 --> 01:11:06.779
SAM: Just 14-- oh.

1795
01:11:06.779 --> 01:11:07.728
LIAM: I beat it.

1796
01:11:07.728 --> 01:11:08.683
MATT: Yeah.

1797
01:11:08.683 --> 01:11:09.685
It's not funny.

1798
01:11:10.644 --> 01:11:12.977
LIAM: What's the punchline mean?

1799
01:11:15.345 --> 01:11:17.722
SAM: Oh god, I will run and hide.

1800
01:11:17.722 --> 01:11:18.745
I'll go back.

1801
01:11:18.745 --> 01:11:19.769
Back behind-- yeah.

1802
01:11:19.769 --> 01:11:21.370
MATT: So you're no longer invisible.

1803
01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.150
SAM: I'll go back behind Yasha, on the other side of Yasha.

1804
01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:26.900
Like near those stalagmites.

1805
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:27.763
MATT: Over here?

1806
01:11:27.763 --> 01:11:30.049
SAM: Yeah, and then bonus action hide.

1807
01:11:30.049 --> 01:11:31.249
MATT: Okay, we'll say small enough.

1808
01:11:31.249 --> 01:11:32.489
You can move over there.

1809
01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:33.947
Make your stealth check.

1810
01:11:33.947 --> 01:11:35.770
SAM: 26.
MATT: 26, all right.

1811
01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:38.726
You feel pretty confident darting in the side,

1812
01:11:38.726 --> 01:11:39.884
pushing against the rock wall,

1813
01:11:39.884 --> 01:11:41.165
and the nearby stalagmite,

1814
01:11:41.165 --> 01:11:42.323
you're held aloft and nothing should be able to see you.

1815
01:11:42.323 --> 01:11:43.156
SAM: Okay.

1816
01:11:43.156 --> 01:11:44.310
MATT: That finishes your go, Nott.

1817
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:45.293
Beau, you're up.

1818
01:11:45.293 --> 01:11:47.046
Jester, you're on deck.

1819
01:11:47.046 --> 01:11:48.049
MARISHA: What did I see?

1820
01:11:48.049 --> 01:11:49.400
MATT: You turn around the corner,

1821
01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.862
and just fire.

1822
01:11:50.862 --> 01:11:52.930
You're just like (groaning) and as soon as you saw the

1823
01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:55.350
flash, your instincts kicked in and you jumped

1824
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.306
out of the way to try to evade out of it.

1825
01:11:57.306 --> 01:11:58.703
It still caught you, but you look forward

1826
01:11:58.703 --> 01:12:01.206
and all you see is Caleb looking strange

1827
01:12:01.206 --> 01:12:02.525
with his hand extended, and you see Yasha run past,

1828
01:12:02.525 --> 01:12:06.120
and Nott tell a joke, look disappointed,

1829
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.035
and then dart off and disappear into the shadow.

1830
01:12:09.035 --> 01:12:10.390
TRAVIS: We are pros.

1831
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:12.366
MATT: That's all you've seen.

1832
01:12:12.366 --> 01:12:14.166
TRAVIS: Super pros.

1833
01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:16.030
MARISHA: Okay, so no real confirmation it was Caleb.

1834
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:17.963
MATT: Not really.

1835
01:12:17.963 --> 01:12:20.240
MARISHA: His hand is up.
MATT: His hand was up.

1836
01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.073
Deduction's up to you.

1837
01:12:26.165 --> 01:12:27.120
MARISHA: Yeah.

1838
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.523
SAM: (cooing) Caleb's a killer.

1839
01:12:28.523 --> 01:12:30.821
(laughter)

1840
01:12:30.821 --> 01:12:34.145
SAM: (cooing) He'll murder us all.

1841
01:12:34.145 --> 01:12:36.740
MARISHA: I'm going to run towards Caleb while asking:

1842
01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.210
What happened?

1843
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.240
MATT: 15, 20.

1844
01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.073
All right.

1845
01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.780
MARISHA: I'm just going to grab Caleb by the wrist

1846
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.010
and look at him, say: Is this the day?

1847
01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:51.740
Is this the day we all feared?

1848
01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.090
Do I have to kill you now?

1849
01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.050
You okay?

1850
01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:56.722
LIAM: That's the end of your turn.

1851
01:12:56.722 --> 01:12:57.813
MARISHA: That's the end of my turn.

1852
01:12:57.813 --> 01:12:58.646
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Straight up.

1853
01:12:58.646 --> 01:12:59.909
Asking if he's okay.

1854
01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:00.967
MATT: Okay, that ends Beau's turn.

1855
01:13:00.967 --> 01:13:01.816
Jester, you're up.

1856
01:13:01.816 --> 01:13:02.666
LAURA: Okay.

1857
01:13:02.666 --> 01:13:03.799
TRAVIS: Fuck.

1858
01:13:05.343 --> 01:13:07.226
TALIESIN: Do you get a saving throw

1859
01:13:07.226 --> 01:13:08.642
against charmed every round, or...?

1860
01:13:08.642 --> 01:13:10.010
MATT: You don't know.

1861
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.079
Different effects work in different ways.

1862
01:13:12.079 --> 01:13:13.478
TALIESIN: That's fair.
LIAM: Matt'll tell us.

1863
01:13:13.478 --> 01:13:15.140
MATT: Yeah, you'll find out when it gets there.

1864
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.888
LIAM: I'm living out my fantasies of killing all of you.

1865
01:13:16.888 --> 01:13:19.257
For four years I've been waiting.

1866
01:13:19.257 --> 01:13:20.757
I've been waiting.

1867
01:13:20.757 --> 01:13:22.349
LAURA: My things are wisdom saves

1868
01:13:22.349 --> 01:13:23.552
and Caleb's wisdom is super high.

1869
01:13:23.552 --> 01:13:25.470
SAM: I assume his intelligence

1870
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:26.582
is super high, too.

1871
01:13:26.582 --> 01:13:28.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, his jaw save isn't super high.

1872
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:29.890
Knock that fucker out.

1873
01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:31.164
LIAM: My AC is pitiful.

1874
01:13:31.164 --> 01:13:33.880
LAURA: I'm going to run forward and try to

1875
01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.570
separate so he can't get all of us again

1876
01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:38.203
and I'm going to go around.

1877
01:13:38.203 --> 01:13:39.736
TRAVIS: De-cleat that motherfucker.

1878
01:13:39.736 --> 01:13:41.830
LIAM: Who get what-- why are you attacking me?

1879
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:43.153
LAURA: How many was that?
LIAM: I'm your friend.

1880
01:13:43.153 --> 01:13:44.162
MATT: Ten feet there.

1881
01:13:44.162 --> 01:13:46.281
LAURA: Can I move this way?
MATT: Yes.

1882
01:13:46.281 --> 01:13:47.779
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30.

1883
01:13:47.779 --> 01:13:48.699
You can move there.

1884
01:13:48.699 --> 01:13:50.074
LAURA: I'm going to cast--

1885
01:13:50.074 --> 01:13:51.815
SAM: Throw chunks of meat at him.

1886
01:13:51.815 --> 01:13:54.800
LAURA: I'm going to cast Blindness/Deafness on Caleb.

1887
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.633
LIAM: Why?

1888
01:13:55.633 --> 01:13:56.674
LAURA: Because like,

1889
01:13:56.674 --> 01:13:59.240
if you're deaf you'll have a hard time casting your spells.

1890
01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.440
I assume.
LIAM: I'm your friend.

1891
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.000
Wouldn't you want me to help you in this endeavor?

1892
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.120
LAURA: You came around the corner and you cast a Fireball

1893
01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.940
at us. Your hand was up, bitch.

1894
01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.233
MATT: You were right below Fjord, so did see this happen.

1895
01:14:09.233 --> 01:14:11.666
MARISHA: You saw more than us.

1896
01:14:11.666 --> 01:14:13.175
TRAVIS: There is no Caleb.

1897
01:14:13.175 --> 01:14:15.920
LAURA: I know. I'm going to choose Deafness because I feel

1898
01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.010
like Caleb's-- wait, does he have more verbal components?

1899
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:21.670
Does he, I would know, does he speak when he casts

1900
01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:22.511
his spells usually?

1901
01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:24.772
MATT: Most of them, yeah.

1902
01:14:24.772 --> 01:14:26.688
In fact, all of them.

1903
01:14:26.688 --> 01:14:27.713
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to cast

1904
01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:28.992
Deafness on him.
MATT: Okay.

1905
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:31.858
Go ahead and make-- is it a wisdom saving throw?

1906
01:14:31.858 --> 01:14:34.256
LAURA: Constitution.
MATT: Constitution, go for it.

1907
01:14:35.398 --> 01:14:36.780
LIAM: Okay.

1908
01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.419
A big bonus to that.

1909
01:14:38.419 --> 01:14:40.090
That is a 16.

1910
01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:41.369
LAURA: 16.

1911
01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:43.417
MATT: Ooh, he resists it!

1912
01:14:43.417 --> 01:14:45.700
LAURA: Wait, he resists it, but if, but--

1913
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.617
SAM: But please?
LAURA: No, but--

1914
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.140
MATT: Your friend's too good, guys.

1915
01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.390
LAURA: That's balls.

1916
01:14:53.769 --> 01:14:56.805
TRAVIS: Somebody bonk this fucking wizard!

1917
01:14:56.805 --> 01:14:59.348
MATT: For some reason right now--

1918
01:14:59.348 --> 01:15:00.298
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1919
01:15:00.298 --> 01:15:01.348
MATT: You're seeing

1920
01:15:01.348 --> 01:15:04.440
things clearer. This whole ruse, this whole time

1921
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.790
has been your friends trying to get you here to kill you,

1922
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.620
and in the moment that something allies you,

1923
01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.820
you look and your friends are casting magic at you.

1924
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.361
Jester tries to blind you.

1925
01:15:13.361 --> 01:15:14.703
LAURA: I was trying to deafen you.

1926
01:15:14.703 --> 01:15:16.319
MATT: You have to defend yourself.

1927
01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:19.780
MARISHA: No! I was trying to get through to you!

1928
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.041
MATT: Jester, that's your action, and your movement.

1929
01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:23.158
That your turn?

1930
01:15:23.158 --> 01:15:25.397
MARISHA: I was trying to be best friends.

1931
01:15:25.397 --> 01:15:28.399
(laughter)

1932
01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:29.232
MATT: All right, that ends your turn.

1933
01:15:29.232 --> 01:15:31.460
LAURA: I'm going to just back up

1934
01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.293
against the wall.

1935
01:15:32.293 --> 01:15:33.126
MATT: That's all your movement there.

1936
01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:35.540
LAURA: I'm going to crouch down as my bonus action.

1937
01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.540
MATT: Okay.

1938
01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.680
Caleb, it's your turn.

1939
01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.380
SAM: Oh, god.
MATT: Can I see your

1940
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.121
spell list real fast?

1941
01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:44.323
SAM: Oh god!

1942
01:15:44.323 --> 01:15:45.920
LIAM: Probably want to use the one at the bottom, Matt.

1943
01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.180
I think is probably the one to use.

1944
01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.800
MARISHA: What are you trying-- why are you helping him?

1945
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.817
TRAVIS: I'd be doing the same thing. This is great.

1946
01:15:52.817 --> 01:15:54.250
This is great.

1947
01:15:56.862 --> 01:15:57.695
MATT: Yeah.

1948
01:15:57.695 --> 01:15:59.300
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1949
01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.276
SAM: Yeah.

1950
01:16:00.276 --> 01:16:01.109
MATT: Yeah.

1951
01:16:02.361 --> 01:16:03.610
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond.

1952
01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:06.660
All the spells you need to kill your own party.

1953
01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:07.599
MATT: Yeah.

1954
01:16:07.599 --> 01:16:09.507
SAM: You have a friend, you want to kill 'em?

1955
01:16:09.507 --> 01:16:10.598
Go to D&amp;D Beyond.

1956
01:16:10.598 --> 01:16:13.920
MATT: As that happens, and that moment peaks up

1957
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.640
in your mind, as you see her finishing casting a spell

1958
01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.090
and Beau's right in front of you.

1959
01:16:20.515 --> 01:16:21.610
LIAM: And I will do a line

1960
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.290
that arcs around me that centers on Beauregard

1961
01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:27.670
and stretches out to Yasha and to Jester

1962
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.269
because they are trying to kill me.

1963
01:16:29.269 --> 01:16:30.102
MATT: Indeed.

1964
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:35.270
SAM: No!

1965
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:36.877
LAURA: He's going to kill me.

1966
01:16:36.877 --> 01:16:37.943
I'm going to die.

1967
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:40.770
Caleb is about to kill me.

1968
01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:41.870
TRAVIS: I understand.

1969
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:44.260
LAURA: Then you're going to finish me off.

1970
01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:46.590
MATT: As this wall suddenly bursts up,

1971
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:49.570
right in front of Caleb, off the side of the chamber there.

1972
01:16:51.575 --> 01:16:52.908
What's the damage?

1973
01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:54.308
MARISHA: Do I get evasion for something like this?

1974
01:16:54.308 --> 01:16:56.240
LAURA: Yeah, do we get to roll
a dexterity check?

1975
01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.390
MATT: He's going to let you know what you need

1976
01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:00.388
with the damage being this side of the wall.

1977
01:17:00.388 --> 01:17:01.221
LIAM: 16.

1978
01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.533
MARISHA: Evasion.

1979
01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:07.263
TALIESIN: Nope.

1980
01:17:08.152 --> 01:17:08.985
LAURA: 11.

1981
01:17:08.985 --> 01:17:10.547
MATT: 11, that's a fail.

1982
01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:11.920
MARISHA: 24.
MATT: 24 is a success.

1983
01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.315
You take no damage.

1984
01:17:13.315 --> 01:17:14.148
LIAM: Not too bad.

1985
01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:16.820
SAM: What are you at? Why are you there?

1986
01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.611
LAURA: Because he hit me with a fucking Fireball.

1987
01:17:18.611 --> 01:17:19.745
SAM: Oh, that's right.

1988
01:17:19.745 --> 01:17:21.956
TRAVIS: I cannot believe, you guys.

1989
01:17:21.956 --> 01:17:23.960
LIAM: 15 points of fire damage.

1990
01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.670
SAM: Not bad.

1991
01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:27.745
MATT: How far from the wall?

1992
01:17:27.745 --> 01:17:29.369
LIAM: My side is fine.

1993
01:17:29.369 --> 01:17:31.612
Ten feet out from the other side.

1994
01:17:31.612 --> 01:17:33.445
MATT: Okay, Fjord, you also have to make a

1995
01:17:33.445 --> 01:17:34.595
dexterity saving throw.

1996
01:17:34.595 --> 01:17:35.594
TRAVIS: Okay.

1997
01:17:35.594 --> 01:17:37.177
LAURA: Can I jump forward and--?

1998
01:17:37.177 --> 01:17:38.435
TRAVIS: That's good, 19.

1999
01:17:38.435 --> 01:17:40.068
LIAM: You take half damage,

2000
01:17:40.068 --> 01:17:41.860
so seven or eight.

2001
01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.795
I don't know how you round up or down.

2002
01:17:43.795 --> 01:17:44.893
MATT: Down.

2003
01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.540
So even points of fire damage.

2004
01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.580
Beau takes none, you take a full 15.

2005
01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:50.135
I also need you to make another wisdom

2006
01:17:50.135 --> 01:17:51.817
saving throw for me, please.

2007
01:17:51.817 --> 01:17:53.070
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

2008
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:54.109
17.

2009
01:17:54.109 --> 01:17:58.420
MATT: 17. Your vision becomes clear a voice kicks out of you

2010
01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:02.123
and you're like, "What the fuck was that?"

2011
01:18:04.955 --> 01:18:07.210
TRAVIS: (explosion sound) (yelling)

2012
01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:09.040
MATT: Caleb, you begin to step back.

2013
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.900
Just making your way gingerly across the stones

2014
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.120
on he cusp of the water, stepping away

2015
01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.680
as the flames fill the space in the gaps here.

2016
01:18:18.373 --> 01:18:19.448
There we go.

2017
01:18:19.448 --> 01:18:21.589
LIAM: Anyone who ends their turn in that

2018
01:18:21.589 --> 01:18:23.170
is going to get hit.

2019
01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.650
MATT: Or anybody who crosses it also.

2020
01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:27.830
TRAVIS: Is anyone currently in the wall?

2021
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:30.567
MATT: Currently Jester and Yasha and Beau.

2022
01:18:30.567 --> 01:18:31.850
All three of them are like--

2023
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:33.824
TRAVIS: Gotta get out of it.

2024
01:18:33.824 --> 01:18:36.841
MATT: Actually, you're the only one

2025
01:18:36.841 --> 01:18:40.540
that's in the wall. The other two are on this side of it.

2026
01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:43.550
All right, so that finishes your turn, Caleb.

2027
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:44.950
Caduceus, you're up.

2028
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:47.550
You cannot see anything beyond that fire, by the way.

2029
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:50.370
That wall, the entire chamber, you're sitting there,

2030
01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:52.681
coming around the corner and all of a sudden just,

2031
01:18:52.681 --> 01:18:53.930
after the explosion, wall of fire

2032
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:55.370
and all you see is flames.

2033
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:57.910
You just see flames and Beau going (grunting)

2034
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:59.710
and Jester pushing out of it

2035
01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:01.930
and fire curling up on the edge of her arms.

2036
01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:03.810
Absolute chaos has broken into the interior

2037
01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:05.550
of this chamber. What are you doing?

2038
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:09.025
TALIESIN: I'm going to get as close as I can

2039
01:19:09.025 --> 01:19:10.442
to that firewall.

2040
01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:13.561
Without taking the damage.

2041
01:19:13.561 --> 01:19:15.372
MATT: That's as close as you can get there.

2042
01:19:15.372 --> 01:19:17.188
LIAM: 15 feet is safe.

2043
01:19:17.188 --> 01:19:18.513
TALIESIN: Wow, okay.

2044
01:19:18.513 --> 01:19:20.080
I can't see anything through it?

2045
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.577
MATT: No, nothing.

2046
01:19:21.577 --> 01:19:22.910
LAURA: Who all can you see?

2047
01:19:28.505 --> 01:19:29.663
TALIESIN: Well, I'm going to--

2048
01:19:29.663 --> 01:19:30.971
LAURA: Why? So you know

2049
01:19:30.971 --> 01:19:32.391
what to do to finish me off?

2050
01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:34.789
(laughter)

2051
01:19:34.789 --> 01:19:36.050
TALIESIN: All right, hold on.

2052
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:38.250
This is really difficult to deal with.

2053
01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:40.580
Do I have anything I can do about this?

2054
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.781
I'm so sorry.

2055
01:19:41.781 --> 01:19:44.362
I genuinely-- this threw all of my plans into whack.

2056
01:19:44.362 --> 01:19:46.777
SAM: A swarm of bugs appear around Laura.

2057
01:19:46.777 --> 01:19:48.732
TALIESIN: There are no swarm of bugs.

2058
01:19:48.732 --> 01:19:50.890
Yeah, I am fucked.

2059
01:19:50.890 --> 01:19:52.150
I am going to do a--

2060
01:19:54.892 --> 01:19:59.020
I suppose I'm going to do,--it seems silly to do that.

2061
01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.457
I'm so sorry.

2062
01:20:00.457 --> 01:20:03.698
I'm going to do a heal on Fjord.

2063
01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:04.935
LAURA: Beacon of Hope?

2064
01:20:04.935 --> 01:20:06.820
TALIESIN: I can't see you.

2065
01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.860
LAURA: You can't see us?

2066
01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.445
TALIESIN: Beacon of hope

2067
01:20:09.445 --> 01:20:10.580
needs sight, doesn't it?

2068
01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:11.960
Yeah, I need to be able to see people

2069
01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.177
for Beacon of Hope.

2070
01:20:13.177 --> 01:20:14.430
I can only see one person, so it seems like

2071
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:16.020
it's the only thing to do.

2072
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.097
Who can I see?

2073
01:20:17.097 --> 01:20:20.180
MATT: You can see Fjord, Beau, and Yasha.

2074
01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.630
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, okay, that's enough.

2075
01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:24.810
I'll do Beacon of Hope then at that point.

2076
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:26.382
SAM: Beacon of coke?

2077
01:20:26.382 --> 01:20:28.632
(laughter)

2078
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.028
MATT: Fjord, Beau, and Yasha all are affected by this,

2079
01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.616
nobody else is.
TALIESIN: And myself.

2080
01:20:34.616 --> 01:20:37.750
TALIESIN: And then--I can't do a bonus action heal

2081
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:38.966
for that on top of that?

2082
01:20:38.966 --> 01:20:40.495
MATT: No, you cannot.

2083
01:20:40.495 --> 01:20:43.514
SAM: Whatever you want, man. We're invincible.

2084
01:20:43.514 --> 01:20:44.638
MATT: You have healing potions, but--

2085
01:20:44.638 --> 01:20:45.688
MARISHA: Go to Vegas, man.

2086
01:20:45.688 --> 01:20:48.057
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm going to curl around the corner then

2087
01:20:48.057 --> 01:20:50.260
and hide because this is insane shit.

2088
01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.884
MATT: Around the corner here?

2089
01:20:51.884 --> 01:20:53.180
TALIESIN: No, the other way.
MATT: All right.

2090
01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.140
Good call.

2091
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.697
It's too hot, you're like,

2092
01:20:55.697 --> 01:20:58.657
"I'm not going to get involved with that."

2093
01:20:58.657 --> 01:21:00.340
There is a puppy that is currently--

2094
01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:03.333
TALIESIN: Oh, my bonus actions, I am going to use the--

2095
01:21:03.333 --> 01:21:04.433
MATT: Spare the Dying?

2096
01:21:04.433 --> 01:21:05.710
TALIESIN: Yeah, Spare the Dying.

2097
01:21:05.710 --> 01:21:08.747
MATT: Good, so your blink dog is no longer--

2098
01:21:08.747 --> 01:21:10.616
Nugget is stabilized.

2099
01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:13.150
All right, that finishes your go.

2100
01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:15.740
LAURA: In the flames just burned to a crisp,

2101
01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.598
all three death saves.

2102
01:21:17.598 --> 01:21:19.720
SAM: Your next character could be the dog.

2103
01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.800
Or weasel, is it a weasel? what is it?

2104
01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.805
Is it a dog?

2105
01:21:22.805 --> 01:21:24.720
LAURA: My weasel is in the fire right now for sure.

2106
01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.380
SAM: Oh, for sure.

2107
01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.513
Is the weasel dead?

2108
01:21:27.513 --> 01:21:28.846
LAURA: Mm-mm.
SAM: No?!

2109
01:21:28.846 --> 01:21:30.202
MATT: Fjord. Your turn.

2110
01:21:30.202 --> 01:21:33.086
LAURA: My robes are super flame retardant.

2111
01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:36.109
MARISHA: Weasel survives everything.

2112
01:21:36.109 --> 01:21:38.173
TRAVIS: My turn?
MATT: Yeah, your brain clears

2113
01:21:38.173 --> 01:21:41.590
from the burning sensation, shaking the influence

2114
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:44.130
from your mind, you focus for a second

2115
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:45.990
and all you see is your friends,

2116
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:49.500
some of them alight, the heat is blaring towards you

2117
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.250
and it's just a wall of roaring flames in front of you.

2118
01:21:53.525 --> 01:21:55.120
TRAVIS: Well.

2119
01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.710
We got to put out this flame.

2120
01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:59.050
I saw the cavern before the wall went up.

2121
01:21:59.050 --> 01:22:02.432
I'm going to cast Control Water.

2122
01:22:02.432 --> 01:22:03.265
LAURA: Yeah.

2123
01:22:03.265 --> 01:22:05.073
TRAVIS: I will summon the water behind Caleb

2124
01:22:05.073 --> 01:22:06.970
into a 20 foot wall behind him

2125
01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:08.800
and it will slam into him from behind

2126
01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.500
and send him into the wall.

2127
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.550
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Into the wall of fire?

2128
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:13.463
TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Whoa.

2129
01:22:13.463 --> 01:22:14.608
MATT: Okay.

2130
01:22:14.608 --> 01:22:16.366
LIAM: This is an interesting physics experiment.

2131
01:22:16.366 --> 01:22:17.199
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

2132
01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:19.700
LIAM: Does magic water affect magic fire?

2133
01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.617
This side of the wall does not--

2134
01:22:21.617 --> 01:22:23.708
MATT: It's magic fire versus non magic water.

2135
01:22:23.708 --> 01:22:25.240
But the water is brought up.

2136
01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.650
Here's what happens.

2137
01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:31.610
First, as you're moving back, just in this

2138
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:34.469
hazed state, you feel something float up

2139
01:22:34.469 --> 01:22:36.843
from underneath, some sort of weird

2140
01:22:36.843 --> 01:22:38.380
bouncy buoyant sensation as--

2141
01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:39.550
LIAM: Like a Japanese toilet.

2142
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:40.383
MATT: Yeah.

2143
01:22:41.311 --> 01:22:45.144
As you are essentially given a nice blast of--

2144
01:22:46.467 --> 01:22:47.300
TRAVIS: Bull's eye.

2145
01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:48.133
SAM: Bidet.

2146
01:22:48.133 --> 01:22:50.390
MATT: This is the bidet.

2147
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:54.060
You get magically bidet'ed by Fjord.

2148
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.547
As the stagnant water of the still pool

2149
01:22:56.547 --> 01:22:59.670
erupts from beneath and lurches forward,

2150
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:00.640
blasting you into the wall.

2151
01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.187
Go ahead and make a constitution saving throw

2152
01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:04.300
for yourself or whatever the save is.

2153
01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.400
Is it dexterity for the wall?

2154
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.249
LIAM: Wall is dex.
MATT: Dex.

2155
01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:09.550
Roll and make a dex save for your own flame.

2156
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:11.530
LIAM: Wait, con first or--?
MATT: No, sorry.

2157
01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:12.815
Dex save for that.

2158
01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.820
LIAM: I did pretty good.

2159
01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.459
That is an 18.

2160
01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:19.242
MATT: 18. Go ahead and roll damage.

2161
01:23:19.242 --> 01:23:20.075
LIAM: Okay.

2162
01:23:20.075 --> 01:23:22.244
Wall for myself was 5d8.

2163
01:23:22.244 --> 01:23:23.930
LAURA: Can you take damage from your own wall?

2164
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:26.360
LIAM: Well, one side doesn't hurt, but if it's pushing me

2165
01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.409
forward, I go through the bad side.

2166
01:23:28.409 --> 01:23:30.349
MATT: If you go through the wall, then yes.

2167
01:23:30.349 --> 01:23:33.100
LIAM: Seven, 15, 28.

2168
01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.540
MATT: That's how much you will take if you hit it.

2169
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.620
Make a strength check to see if you managed

2170
01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:39.152
to hold onto the nearby rocks to resist.

2171
01:23:39.152 --> 01:23:40.858
TRAVIS: I was hoping. That's the only stat

2172
01:23:40.858 --> 01:23:42.127
I know of his that sucks.

2173
01:23:43.682 --> 01:23:44.765
LIAM: 19.

2174
01:23:44.765 --> 01:23:47.211
(laughter)

2175
01:23:47.211 --> 01:23:49.280
MARISHA: It's his weakness.

2176
01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.994
MATT: I can't believe that.

2177
01:23:50.994 --> 01:23:53.411
LIAM: 200 push-ups a day, people.

2178
01:23:54.566 --> 01:23:55.841
TALIESIN: We're all going to die.

2179
01:23:55.841 --> 01:23:57.007
LAURA: Goddamn it.

2180
01:23:57.007 --> 01:23:57.870
TALIESIN: So good.

2181
01:23:57.870 --> 01:24:00.787
MATT: Caleb, you hold onto the stone and the water

2182
01:24:00.787 --> 01:24:04.550
rushes past you as it splashes forward.

2183
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:07.530
MARISHA: You dropped dead so easily so many other times.

2184
01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:09.513
MATT: I need Beau and Yasha to also make

2185
01:24:09.513 --> 01:24:11.096
strength saving throws to try

2186
01:24:11.096 --> 01:24:12.497
and hold onto their space.

2187
01:24:12.497 --> 01:24:15.423
They're pushed back by the wave as well.

2188
01:24:15.423 --> 01:24:17.408
TRAVIS: The wall stays up, the water just goes through it.

2189
01:24:17.408 --> 01:24:18.270
MARISHA: 20 total.

2190
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:20.050
MATT: 20, yeah, you hold your position there.

2191
01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:21.570
Yasha, roll for hers.
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry.

2192
01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:23.136
MARISHA: Does that mean it takes out

2193
01:24:23.136 --> 01:24:25.719
pieces of the fire wall? Water?

2194
01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:30.080
TRAVIS: 19.

2195
01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.210
MATT: 19, cool.

2196
01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.870
You both manage to hold on.

2197
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:37.890
The water, like it had attempted to try previously,

2198
01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:40.613
it does splash over the wall and the wall

2199
01:24:40.613 --> 01:24:44.040
sizzles out, and there's steam that rises up

2200
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.570
as the water cascades and splashes

2201
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:50.200
over the rest of the stone, slicking the entire floor

2202
01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.820
of this side, as your Control Water first blast.

2203
01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:54.560
You're still concentrating on the spell.

2204
01:24:56.170 --> 01:24:58.470
Actually, pulling it this way, make a strength check

2205
01:24:58.470 --> 01:25:00.115
for yourself, as well.

2206
01:25:01.536 --> 01:25:02.739
As it does blast through.

2207
01:25:02.739 --> 01:25:04.035
TRAVIS: Natural one.

2208
01:25:05.056 --> 01:25:06.380
MARISHA: Oh my god.
MATT: You get pushed back.

2209
01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:07.797
Slam in the wall.

2210
01:25:10.025 --> 01:25:13.860
Make a concentration check on your Control Water.

2211
01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.840
LAURA: Oh my god, this is amazing.

2212
01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.957
MATT: I think you have War Caster,

2213
01:25:16.957 --> 01:25:17.947
so you have advantage on that, right?

2214
01:25:17.947 --> 01:25:22.450
TRAVIS: I do. That's okay, though. 18.

2215
01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:23.530
22.

2216
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:27.155
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

2217
01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:27.988
Fjord.

2218
01:25:27.988 --> 01:25:28.821
TRAVIS: Fuck me.

2219
01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:29.730
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

2220
01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:32.819
LIAM: Murphy's Law is in full fucking effect right now.

2221
01:25:32.819 --> 01:25:35.160
MATT: I know, seriously, straight up.

2222
01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.786
All right, so, concentration's ten minutes on this.

2223
01:25:39.786 --> 01:25:42.590
You can repeat it again next turn, if you want to.

2224
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:44.179
TRAVIS: Okay.

2225
01:25:44.179 --> 01:25:46.160
MATT: Right now, as it goes over the water,

2226
01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:50.850
the wall diminishes and until Caleb's next turn, I'll say,

2227
01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:52.735
it's beginning to burn back up.

2228
01:25:52.735 --> 01:25:53.568
When it gets back to Caleb's round,

2229
01:25:53.568 --> 01:25:56.829
the Wall of Fire's going to come back up.

2230
01:25:56.829 --> 01:25:58.649
MARISHA: We got a window.

2231
01:25:58.649 --> 01:26:01.560
MATT: As far as you know. We'll see.

2232
01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.777
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got five turns, four turns.

2233
01:26:04.777 --> 01:26:05.610
MATT: Well.

2234
01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:07.750
SAM: You've got four seconds.

2235
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:10.140
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean four people.

2236
01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:11.960
MATT: That ends Fjord's go.

2237
01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.150
Top of the round.

2238
01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:15.974
TRAVIS: Oh, and the other two sons of bitches

2239
01:26:15.974 --> 01:26:17.291
are just fucking--

2240
01:26:17.291 --> 01:26:19.215
SAM: We're fighting each other.

2241
01:26:19.215 --> 01:26:21.260
LIAM: We haven't touched the enemies at all.

2242
01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.120
MATT: The wall currently, while it's placed there,

2243
01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.803
is not blocking vision.

2244
01:26:25.803 --> 01:26:28.220
A grunt of frustration happens, as around the corner--

2245
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.400
LAURA: Like the whole wall is not blocking vision?

2246
01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.478
MATT: Currently, for the time being.

2247
01:26:32.478 --> 01:26:34.230
LIAM: It's fizzled down to two inches. It's getting ready

2248
01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:35.329
to fire back up.

2249
01:26:35.329 --> 01:26:37.654
MATT: Correct. It comes around the corner is like,

2250
01:26:37.654 --> 01:26:42.150
"(sighing) You'll do," because you're the one closest to it.

2251
01:26:42.150 --> 01:26:44.720
It looks towards you and gives a little wink and

2252
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.867
puts a hand out this way.

2253
01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.990
In the middle of your head, just the voice,

2254
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:51.070
the telepathic words meet you and say,

2255
01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:52.903
"You're pretty. So am I."

2256
01:26:52.903 --> 01:26:53.736
LAURA: Thank you. Yes, you are.

2257
01:26:53.736 --> 01:26:55.263
MATT: Make a wisdom save.

2258
01:26:55.263 --> 01:26:56.904
TRAVIS: Do you have any advantage or resistance or?

2259
01:26:56.904 --> 01:26:58.446
LAURA: No, I don't have Beacon of Hope on me.

2260
01:26:58.446 --> 01:26:59.904
TRAVIS: You're a tiefling.

2261
01:26:59.904 --> 01:27:01.145
SAM: Beacon of cope.

2262
01:27:01.145 --> 01:27:02.470
LIAM: Could she hear Greg Cipes' voice in her head?

2263
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:03.303
MATT: I think so, yeah.

2264
01:27:03.303 --> 01:27:04.940
LIAM: (like Greg Cipes) 'Sup mama?

2265
01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.523
LAURA: Oh, wait, wisdom?

2266
01:27:06.523 --> 01:27:08.739
Oh, ha, ooh ha ha! 24!

2267
01:27:08.739 --> 01:27:11.230
MATT: 24, nice.

2268
01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:12.850
All right.

2269
01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:17.147
As you resist it, it looks at you and goes (frustrated sigh)

2270
01:27:17.147 --> 01:27:19.356
LAURA: What's wrong? You know, you're really cute!

2271
01:27:19.356 --> 01:27:21.590
MATT: You hear in the back of your skull, "Come on."

2272
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:26.590
It darts back out of sight around this way and vanishes.

2273
01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:28.170
LAURA: Does that mean that the Wall of Fire

2274
01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:30.100
is not burning me now?

2275
01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:34.010
MATT: For the time being, it is not. Ending that go.

2276
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:35.750
TRAVIS: Which section of the wall is sizzling

2277
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.960
but about to come back up?

2278
01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.480
You said part of the wall is down.

2279
01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.580
MATT: This area right here.

2280
01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:44.099
Everything the water came forward.

2281
01:27:44.099 --> 01:27:46.220
Yasha and this wall are the two that are still up.

2282
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:50.400
It's this midsection where the water crashed forward.

2283
01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.777
That ends their go, Yasha's up.

2284
01:27:52.777 --> 01:27:56.190
TRAVIS: Yasha's up. The wall in front of her is down, right?

2285
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:57.731
MATT: This wall here is still up.

2286
01:27:57.731 --> 01:28:01.166
TRAVIS: She can run to the right and come through?

2287
01:28:01.166 --> 01:28:02.855
Yeah, she's going to come around like a linebacker,

2288
01:28:02.855 --> 01:28:04.810
coming at the fucking QB, and she's going to deck Caleb

2289
01:28:04.810 --> 01:28:05.643
right in the face.

2290
01:28:05.643 --> 01:28:07.359
SAM: Yeah. With a sword or--?

2291
01:28:07.359 --> 01:28:09.350
TRAVIS: Yeah. With the blunt part of the sword.

2292
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:10.558
MATT: It is a rough space to get through

2293
01:28:10.558 --> 01:28:12.520
because there are a number of stalagmites

2294
01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.358
that are blocking the way. She gets over there.

2295
01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:16.770
She gets an attack, but it's with disadvantage.

2296
01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:18.450
TRAVIS: Oh balls. She will make it reckless.

2297
01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:22.028
MATT: That evens it out. First strike against Caleb.

2298
01:28:22.028 --> 01:28:26.253
TRAVIS: Chicka chicka chicka chicka. 13.

2299
01:28:26.253 --> 01:28:27.360
MATT: What's your armor class?

2300
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:31.950
LIAM: Well, I am doing, it is 14 right now.

2301
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:34.057
Because I have a Mage Armor on.

2302
01:28:34.057 --> 01:28:35.059
MATT: You do.

2303
01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:36.500
Yasha comes around the corner, giant swing.

2304
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.580
Unfortunately, her feet are having a hard time

2305
01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.878
finding purchase on the rough stones

2306
01:28:40.878 --> 01:28:43.930
and swings wide and it goes towards Caleb.

2307
01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:45.530
Caleb, you look up for a second.

2308
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:48.100
Once again, you thought they were your friends.

2309
01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:50.280
Yasha streaks towards you, and as you put your hand up,

2310
01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:52.840
the arcane field that you've already defended yourself with

2311
01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.558
just glides it off, inches from striking you in the chest.

2312
01:28:56.558 --> 01:28:58.250
How could they turn on you like this?

2313
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:01.200
LIAM: I thought she and I were introverts together.

2314
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.350
MATT: Roll another attack.

2315
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:03.200
TRAVIS: Second one reckless, also.

2316
01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.750
Straight up roll, that's going to hit with a 24.

2317
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:09.253
MATT: 24, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.

2318
01:29:09.253 --> 01:29:13.928
TRAVIS: (humming) I'll just roll this one twice.

2319
01:29:13.928 --> 01:29:15.620
Oh, there we go, okay.

2320
01:29:16.595 --> 01:29:19.395
Four, five, seven.

2321
01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:21.130
Plus five, 12, 12 points of slashing damage,

2322
01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:23.187
plus two for the divine.

2323
01:29:23.187 --> 01:29:24.212
That's 14 points.

2324
01:29:24.212 --> 01:29:25.045
MATT: That's with the rage, as well?

2325
01:29:25.045 --> 01:29:25.878
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2326
01:29:25.878 --> 01:29:27.795
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage to you, Caleb.

2327
01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:31.572
Both make a concentration check.

2328
01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:35.216
LIAM: At advantage with a huge bonus.

2329
01:29:35.216 --> 01:29:36.794
TRAVIS: Stop rolling--

2330
01:29:37.843 --> 01:29:38.890
LIAM: First one was a 19.

2331
01:29:38.890 --> 01:29:40.423
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2332
01:29:40.423 --> 01:29:41.256
LIAM: And a nine.

2333
01:29:41.256 --> 01:29:43.160
MATT: Okay. Now make another wisdom saving throw for me.

2334
01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.300
LIAM: That's at 25 total. Wisdom save.

2335
01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.600
LAURA: Low, low, low, low!

2336
01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.159
LIAM: That's a 19.

2337
01:29:49.159 --> 01:29:52.235
LAURA: High, high, high, high! I mean.

2338
01:29:52.235 --> 01:29:55.237
(laughter)

2339
01:29:55.237 --> 01:29:57.881
MATT: As you're struck, the pain sears into you

2340
01:29:57.881 --> 01:29:59.000
as a Magician's Judge carves into your chest

2341
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.540
and actually sticks there, and you're like (yelling).

2342
01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:04.150
You see Yasha holding it there, sweat dripping down

2343
01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:06.480
her brow, her eyes intense, like the teeth and jaw

2344
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.250
just clenched from the rage, and also this look

2345
01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:10.950
of like, "Come on!" in her eyes.

2346
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:13.460
In that moment, the influence shakes from your mind,

2347
01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:16.130
and you're like, "Wait, what am I doing?"

2348
01:30:16.130 --> 01:30:20.447
You realize this has not been your intent this entire time.

2349
01:30:20.447 --> 01:30:21.280
You're no longer charmed.

2350
01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.013
LIAM: <i>Was ist los?</i>

2351
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:26.790
MATT: That ends Yasha's turn, I believe.

2352
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:27.850
TRAVIS: Yes.

2353
01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:30.580
MATT: Nott, you're up.

2354
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.103
SAM: I mean. Do I see?

2355
01:30:37.103 --> 01:30:39.480
MATT: No, you just see fire.

2356
01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.810
SAM: None of the baddies, none of the baddies?

2357
01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:43.170
MATT: You don't see any. You can use your action

2358
01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:45.750
to try and look for them.

2359
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:48.170
SAM: Can I see Jester, can I see my friends?

2360
01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:50.686
MATT: No, you are hiding behind here.

2361
01:30:50.686 --> 01:30:53.731
Actually looking around this way, you can see Jester

2362
01:30:53.731 --> 01:30:55.960
and Beau over here.

2363
01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.680
You do not see Caleb or Yasha

2364
01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.390
because they are currently obscured by the wall

2365
01:30:59.390 --> 01:31:01.214
where you're currently standing.

2366
01:31:01.214 --> 01:31:02.047
LIAM: The enemies are nowhere to be seen.

2367
01:31:02.047 --> 01:31:04.334
MATT: Yeah, you have no idea.

2368
01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.654
TRAVIS: Fucking-- Jesus.

2369
01:31:06.654 --> 01:31:10.153
SAM: Shit.

2370
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:14.087
I don't see Caleb or Yasha?

2371
01:31:15.230 --> 01:31:18.750
I didn't see that happen between Caleb and Yasha?

2372
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:20.610
MATT: You do not, no.

2373
01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:23.685
SAM: I would pop around towards that side,

2374
01:31:23.685 --> 01:31:24.985
the Caleb and Yasha side.

2375
01:31:24.985 --> 01:31:25.820
MATT: Right here?

2376
01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:27.061
SAM: Yes.

2377
01:31:27.061 --> 01:31:29.228
MATT: Okay. In order to move through this space,

2378
01:31:29.228 --> 01:31:32.334
an acrobatics check to try and avoid the wall.

2379
01:31:32.334 --> 01:31:36.480
SAM: Okay. Acrobatics check: 20.

2380
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.555
MATT: Not a problem, you manage to leap off

2381
01:31:38.555 --> 01:31:40.513
the side of the wall and land on this edge,

2382
01:31:40.513 --> 01:31:43.479
avoiding the flames from burning.

2383
01:31:43.479 --> 01:31:46.393
You're there. You can see now Yasha

2384
01:31:46.393 --> 01:31:49.200
withdrawing the blade from Caleb's shoulder

2385
01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.040
and chest area and Caleb blinking

2386
01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:55.155
and shaking his head. That's what you see.

2387
01:31:55.155 --> 01:31:59.490
SAM: Then I will, seeing that that's in hand,

2388
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:01.090
I will heal the person that needs it most.

2389
01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:04.163
I run to Caleb and heal him.

2390
01:32:04.163 --> 01:32:05.029
MATT: Okay.

2391
01:32:05.029 --> 01:32:08.171
SAM: I'll take out

2392
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:11.879
one of these guys and I'll dump it into you.

2393
01:32:11.879 --> 01:32:15.785
TRAVIS: Hell, let's do it. Roll that healing potion.

2394
01:32:15.785 --> 01:32:16.618
SAM: That's--

2395
01:32:16.618 --> 01:32:17.576
LAURA: Four.

2396
01:32:17.576 --> 01:32:21.080
SAM: Seven plus something. What is this plus, four?

2397
01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.580
11 points of healing.

2398
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.353
MATT: 2d4 plus two.

2399
01:32:25.353 --> 01:32:27.650
SAM: Then it's only nine points of healing.

2400
01:32:27.650 --> 01:32:31.067
MATT: You move over this way, past Yasha.

2401
01:32:32.121 --> 01:32:34.400
All right, yeah. With your movement,

2402
01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.900
you can get right there, we'll say.

2403
01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.547
You're on the edge of the water.

2404
01:32:39.547 --> 01:32:42.296
SAM: Here, Matt.

2405
01:32:43.565 --> 01:32:47.137
MATT: All right. That's your turn, Nott. Beau, you're up.

2406
01:32:47.137 --> 01:32:48.608
SAM: I don't have any bonus or anything?

2407
01:32:48.608 --> 01:32:49.875
MATT: You have a bonus action.

2408
01:32:49.875 --> 01:32:51.085
SAM: I'm going to crouch down and see if I can hide

2409
01:32:51.085 --> 01:32:51.926
where I'm standing.

2410
01:32:51.926 --> 01:32:53.750
MATT: Make a stealth check.

2411
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:56.070
SAM: Right in Caleb, 20.

2412
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:58.133
MATT: 20, okay, you got it.

2413
01:32:58.133 --> 01:33:01.024
Finishing your turn, Beau, you're up.

2414
01:33:01.024 --> 01:33:02.671
MARISHA: Little panicked and weirded out

2415
01:33:02.671 --> 01:33:03.582
by everything I'm seeing.

2416
01:33:03.582 --> 01:33:07.173
I'm going to look around. Do I see anybody else?

2417
01:33:08.907 --> 01:33:12.765
MATT: As an action, make a perception check.

2418
01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:16.930
MARISHA: Finally something, 22.

2419
01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:18.500
MATT: 22, okay.

2420
01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:21.990
You see, crouched way up amongst the stalactites

2421
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:24.820
in the ceiling behind Caleb, up in this edge,

2422
01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.320
you see the female of the fiendish creatures

2423
01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.160
you have previously encountered in the battle

2424
01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:31.662
on the surface streets here of Asarius.

2425
01:33:31.662 --> 01:33:33.500
She's crouched and held up in the corner

2426
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.300
and watching over this battle, and you can see

2427
01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:37.310
a look of frustration on her face as to how things

2428
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.700
have shifted most recently.

2429
01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:40.535
MARISHA: Can I get there?

2430
01:33:40.535 --> 01:33:41.718
MATT: That was your action to get there.

2431
01:33:41.718 --> 01:33:43.926
MARISHA: That was my action. Can I move up to her?

2432
01:33:43.926 --> 01:33:44.759
MATT: It's possible.

2433
01:33:44.759 --> 01:33:46.991
MARISHA: Can I do some parkour?

2434
01:33:46.991 --> 01:33:49.949
MATT: Make an acrobatics check, see if you can.

2435
01:33:55.066 --> 01:33:56.166
MATISHA: 15.

2436
01:33:56.166 --> 01:33:57.110
MATT: 15.

2437
01:33:57.110 --> 01:34:02.110
(counting) You can't quite get to her.

2438
01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:07.510
You do manage to leap across, parkour off the edges.

2439
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:10.127
You're not quite in melee with her.

2440
01:34:10.127 --> 01:34:12.235
MARISHA: Fuck, Patient Defense.

2441
01:34:12.235 --> 01:34:14.994
MATT: Okay. You go into defensive stance.

2442
01:34:14.994 --> 01:34:16.350
That finishes your turn.

2443
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:20.350
Now, you start hearing echoing from the tunnels behind

2444
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:23.760
the chamber unseen where Yasha had seen

2445
01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.537
that red flash earlier.

2446
01:34:26.537 --> 01:34:28.835
(growling)

2447
01:34:28.835 --> 01:34:30.669
LAURA: No!

2448
01:34:31.977 --> 01:34:33.727
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

2449
01:34:34.732 --> 01:34:35.850
MATT: More of these creatures

2450
01:34:35.850 --> 01:34:39.593
start pouring around the corner on this side.

2451
01:34:41.250 --> 01:34:42.441
SAM: What are they called quasi?

2452
01:34:42.441 --> 01:34:44.470
MATT: Quasits. They're going to

2453
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:49.470
charge forward to Yasha over here.

2454
01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.590
This one's going to rush over here.

2455
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:55.930
It's going to scream at you, Nott.

2456
01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:57.788
SAM: Okay.

2457
01:34:57.788 --> 01:34:59.530
MATT: One of them did manage to see you,

2458
01:34:59.530 --> 01:35:00.750
as it turned the corner. I need you to make a wisdom

2459
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:03.950
saving throw as it (growling) in your direction.

2460
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:06.260
SAM: 19 naturally.

2461
01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:09.093
MATT: This doesn't even phase you. Nothing to worry about.

2462
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.750
The other two get attacks against Yasha,

2463
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:14.793
but because she did reckless,

2464
01:35:14.793 --> 01:35:18.377
they do get to have advantage on these strikes.

2465
01:35:18.377 --> 01:35:20.250
TRAVIS: I think, doesn't Caleb get reckless against

2466
01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:21.870
the person who does reckless against them?

2467
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:24.690
It's only against the person you take against, right?

2468
01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:27.656
MATT: No. If you're reckless in your attacks, every enemy

2469
01:35:27.656 --> 01:35:29.930
gets attacks at advantage. That's the downside to it.

2470
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:31.326
Yeah, you only played a barbarian

2471
01:35:31.326 --> 01:35:33.595
for three years. It's fine.

2472
01:35:33.595 --> 01:35:34.720
LAURA: I always wondered why

2473
01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:38.670
you were so free with the reckless.

2474
01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:43.320
MATT: Ooh, yeah. The first strike is going to be 21 to hit.

2475
01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.012
TRAVIS: That hits.

2476
01:35:45.012 --> 01:35:46.480
MATT: The next one is going to be 21 to hit.

2477
01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.440
19 natural roll on each. Sorry,

2478
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.702
that would be 23 to hit.

2479
01:35:51.702 --> 01:35:53.260
All right, so for each of those strikes.

2480
01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.453
TALIESIN: She's raging, right?

2481
01:35:54.453 --> 01:35:56.240
MATT: She is raging.

2482
01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.240
Yasha takes nine, reduced to four,

2483
01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.178
and eight reduced to four.

2484
01:36:03.178 --> 01:36:05.917
Eight points of piercing damage.

2485
01:36:05.917 --> 01:36:09.075
She needs to make two constitution saving throws.

2486
01:36:09.075 --> 01:36:12.650
TRAVIS: Okay.

2487
01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:15.584
That's eight.

2488
01:36:15.584 --> 01:36:19.630
The second one is a, fuck, 12.

2489
01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:22.670
MATT: Okay, the second one is a success. The first one.

2490
01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:23.503
TALIESIN: What saving throws?

2491
01:36:23.503 --> 01:36:24.570
TRAVIS: Constitution.

2492
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:27.343
MATT: She takes six additional points of poison damage

2493
01:36:27.343 --> 01:36:29.340
And she is poisoned.

2494
01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:32.970
The claws of these quasits now cause this

2495
01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:37.660
fiendish venom to pulse within the scratch marks

2496
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:39.490
they're leaving on her exposed body.

2497
01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:42.260
They're just slicing into her and then pull back

2498
01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.890
and you can see now this thick, dark venom

2499
01:36:44.890 --> 01:36:47.900
starting to pour out of one of the scratch wounds.

2500
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:50.983
That finishes their go. Fjord, you're up.

2501
01:36:50.983 --> 01:36:53.518
TRAVIS: All right, yeah.

2502
01:36:53.518 --> 01:36:54.940
The wall is still up, right?

2503
01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.899
Or, no, I guess it's down.

2504
01:36:56.899 --> 01:36:57.732
LIAM: At this moment, it's still up.

2505
01:36:57.732 --> 01:36:59.060
LIAM: These both are still there.

2506
01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.020
These are down, they're ready to flare up,

2507
01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.560
since the water has put it out.

2508
01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:07.010
TRAVIS: Then I see the winged biotch up top

2509
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:09.562
from where I am, or do I need to step forward?

2510
01:37:09.562 --> 01:37:10.720
MATT: You do not notice her.

2511
01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:12.740
You'd have to use an action to try and perceive her.

2512
01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:16.032
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll step into the cavern more.

2513
01:37:16.032 --> 01:37:18.727
MATT: (counting) Are you stepping onto where the flames are?

2514
01:37:18.727 --> 01:37:19.967
TRAVIS: I thought they were down just a little bit.

2515
01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:21.150
Are they not?

2516
01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:22.980
MATT: Those are down, but they're about to flare back up.

2517
01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:24.480
Unless Caleb cancels them.

2518
01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.019
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll stay right there.

2519
01:37:26.019 --> 01:37:27.590
Can I see her from there?

2520
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:29.448
MATT: You can make an action to make a perception check.

2521
01:37:29.448 --> 01:37:30.394
Go for it.

2522
01:37:30.394 --> 01:37:32.452
SAM: Steam.

2523
01:37:32.452 --> 01:37:35.743
TRAVIS: Yeah. I can't really do anything else.

2524
01:37:35.743 --> 01:37:37.680
Not great, 11.

2525
01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:38.580
MATT: You don't see anything.

2526
01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.460
All you see is Beau darting up to the side

2527
01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:43.310
and is now like getting defensive and preparing

2528
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:45.060
for an assault from a creature that you can't make out

2529
01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.486
with your eyes, unfortunately.

2530
01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:47.485
TRAVIS: That is my turn.

2531
01:37:47.485 --> 01:37:48.710
MATT: That ends Fjord's go.

2532
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:53.230
Caleb, oh no, I'm sorry, next is--

2533
01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:56.421
LIAM: I'm ready. Jester and Caleb are tied.

2534
01:37:56.421 --> 01:37:58.100
MATT: That's my bad. I looked at the wrong thing.

2535
01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:00.080
Fjord, take that back, since you didn't really

2536
01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.890
do anything, that's fine. Jester, you're up.

2537
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:05.480
MARISHA: So much damn shade!

2538
01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.355
MATT: I didn't mean it to be shade!

2539
01:38:07.355 --> 01:38:09.138
I'm legitimately was saying you'll get a turn still.

2540
01:38:09.138 --> 01:38:10.386
Nothing happened, you're fine.

2541
01:38:10.386 --> 01:38:12.537
SAM: Your turn was useless, you're a useless player.

2542
01:38:12.537 --> 01:38:14.820
MATT: I didn't mean it that way! I'm so sorry!

2543
01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:16.676
TRAVIS: NPC.

2544
01:38:16.676 --> 01:38:19.034
MATT: Jester, your turn.

2545
01:38:19.034 --> 01:38:21.010
LAURA: I'm not technically in the fire.

2546
01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:23.241
Am I on fire, technically, though?

2547
01:38:23.241 --> 01:38:26.150
MATT: Currently you're ten feet from this.

2548
01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:29.600
If you don't move away from within ten feet

2549
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.130
of this one part of the wall,

2550
01:38:31.130 --> 01:38:32.930
you will take damage by the end of your turn.

2551
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:34.430
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to--

2552
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:35.614
MATT: You can move through these.

2553
01:38:35.614 --> 01:38:37.190
LAURA: I'm going to move through those.

2554
01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:38.580
MATT: How far are you going?

2555
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.300
LAURA: Splash splash splash.

2556
01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:45.300
MATT: (counting) 30 would put you right there.

2557
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:47.848
LAURA: I was going to just come around

2558
01:38:47.848 --> 01:38:50.989
and stand right around here. I'm sorry, lady.

2559
01:38:50.989 --> 01:38:52.657
MATT: Oh, you're fine.

2560
01:38:52.657 --> 01:38:54.232
You're right there.

2561
01:38:54.232 --> 01:38:55.820
LAURA: Ow.

2562
01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.195
Yeah, that's where I am.

2563
01:38:58.195 --> 01:39:00.360
Because I'm about to die

2564
01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.560
because Caleb hates me, I'm going to cast

2565
01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.278
Cure Wounds on myself.

2566
01:39:04.278 --> 01:39:05.253
SAM: Yes!

2567
01:39:05.253 --> 01:39:06.544
LAURA: At--

2568
01:39:06.544 --> 01:39:07.619
SAM: 9th-level.

2569
01:39:07.619 --> 01:39:12.536
LAURA: 3rd-level. That's 3d8.

2570
01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:21.420
Ten, 15 plus five points, so 20 points healed.

2571
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:23.136
MATT: 20 points healed, nice.

2572
01:39:23.136 --> 01:39:24.430
SAM: Not bad, not bad.

2573
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:26.515
LAURA: Okay.

2574
01:39:28.405 --> 01:39:30.403
I don't have any good bonus

2575
01:39:30.403 --> 01:39:31.740
that I can use at this point.

2576
01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:33.250
MATT: That finishes your turn?

2577
01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:34.083
LAURA: Sure, why not?

2578
01:39:34.083 --> 01:39:36.149
MATT: Caleb, you're up. Clear minded,

2579
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:37.765
you can see the flames are about to

2580
01:39:37.765 --> 01:39:39.039
rage back up from the ground.

2581
01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:40.800
Do you maintain concentration on the spell?

2582
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.060
LIAM: I drop it.

2583
01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:43.830
MATT: All the flames dissipate,

2584
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:45.490
the steam taking over the chamber,

2585
01:39:45.490 --> 01:39:47.600
and for a brief instant,

2586
01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.030
there's a burst of heat and then it fades back

2587
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:52.830
to the casual, though now even more humid,

2588
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:54.650
interior of the cavern.

2589
01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:57.958
LIAM: Totally shell shocked, not understanding what is

2590
01:39:57.958 --> 01:40:00.783
going on, I just go to an old move and I jam

2591
01:40:00.783 --> 01:40:03.674
the licorice root into my mouth and say:

2592
01:40:03.674 --> 01:40:05.024
I'm sorry, everyone.

2593
01:40:05.024 --> 01:40:08.100
And I cast Haste on Beauregard and I start moving

2594
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:12.937
out of the chamber towards Fjord and Beauregard.

2595
01:40:12.937 --> 01:40:14.558
Beauregard is hasted.

2596
01:40:14.558 --> 01:40:17.358
MATT: I'm sorry. Fair enough.

2597
01:40:17.358 --> 01:40:18.191
You do know where that creature is

2598
01:40:18.191 --> 01:40:19.838
because you've actually seen it.

2599
01:40:19.838 --> 01:40:21.860
You move backward?

2600
01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:23.620
LIAM: Toward Fjord, I'm getting out of the fire.

2601
01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:27.530
MATT: Five, 10, 20.
LIAM: As far as I can get.

2602
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:29.750
MATT: 25, 30, you can move past Fjord if you want.

2603
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:31.278
All right, there you go.

2604
01:40:31.278 --> 01:40:32.640
You're situated. That finishes your turn, Caleb.

2605
01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.210
Caduceus, you're up.

2606
01:40:34.210 --> 01:40:36.350
TALIESIN: Okay, can I see everybody?

2607
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:38.330
I mean, if I come into the chamber?

2608
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:41.401
MATT: Five, 10, 15, yes, now you can see,

2609
01:40:41.401 --> 01:40:44.030
and with your passive perception,

2610
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:45.730
you do see the creature in the corner.

2611
01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:47.900
TALIESIN: Do I see Nott, as well?

2612
01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:49.492
MATT: You do not see Nott.

2613
01:40:49.492 --> 01:40:51.791
TALIESIN: Okay, before I even move,

2614
01:40:51.791 --> 01:40:55.220
I am going to turn-- I don't see Nott?

2615
01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:57.260
MATT: You do not see Nott.
TALIESIN: That's unfortunate.

2616
01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:58.480
But that's okay.

2617
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:03.480
I'm going to turn invisible before I come into the--

2618
01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.318
MATT: All righty.

2619
01:41:06.318 --> 01:41:07.359
TALIESIN: I am invisible

2620
01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:09.050
for the purposes of that.

2621
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:13.010
I am going to recast a Beacon of Hope.

2622
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:15.710
Now I can see everybody, and get everybody except Nott

2623
01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:20.580
in Beacon of Hope, and that's the end of my third levels.

2624
01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.312
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Then with whatever--

2625
01:41:22.312 --> 01:41:23.904
MATT: You probably cast it first before you do it

2626
01:41:23.904 --> 01:41:25.209
because if you're invisible and you cast a spell,

2627
01:41:25.209 --> 01:41:26.314
the invisibility wears off.

2628
01:41:26.314 --> 01:41:27.917
TALIESIN: Okay, I come in, cast the spell--

2629
01:41:27.917 --> 01:41:28.780
MATT: Then turn invisible.

2630
01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:30.085
TALIESIN: Do I have any more movement after that, too?

2631
01:41:30.085 --> 01:41:31.040
MATT: You do.

2632
01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.381
You have 15 more feet.

2633
01:41:32.381 --> 01:41:35.039
TALIESIN: I'm going to hide in the corner

2634
01:41:35.039 --> 01:41:36.300
behind that stalactite.

2635
01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:37.133
MATT: There you go.

2636
01:41:38.089 --> 01:41:40.147
You're cowering as much as you can,

2637
01:41:40.147 --> 01:41:41.280
as a large creature.

2638
01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.630
That finishes your go.

2639
01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:43.920
Fjord, now it's your turn.

2640
01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:46.180
TRAVIS: Oh, you're giving me another turn?

2641
01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:47.880
MATT: Yes, because technically it was out of order

2642
01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:50.261
and you may have more to do this turn.

2643
01:41:50.261 --> 01:41:51.218
TRAIVS: Okay.

2644
01:41:51.218 --> 01:41:52.243
If I step forward--

2645
01:41:52.243 --> 01:41:53.476
MATT: You see the three creatures

2646
01:41:53.476 --> 01:41:56.097
over there. Yeah.

2647
01:41:56.097 --> 01:41:56.990
TRAVIS: That's all I can see?

2648
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:58.174
MATT: That's all you can see at the moment.

2649
01:41:58.174 --> 01:41:59.540
TRAVIS: I'll step forward five or ten feet.

2650
01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:00.530
Give me a line of sight with the three of them.

2651
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:04.670
I will send two Eldritch blasts towards--

2652
01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:06.530
I'll send the first one towards one of the creatures.

2653
01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:07.950
MATT: Go for it.

2654
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:09.020
The first one gets released.

2655
01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:10.650
Streaking over.

2656
01:42:10.650 --> 01:42:13.746
TRAVIS: That is a-- sorry.

2657
01:42:13.746 --> 01:42:15.337
21 to hit.

2658
01:42:15.337 --> 01:42:16.739
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

2659
01:42:16.739 --> 01:42:18.305
MARISHA and LIAM: (mumbled bad Fjord accent) Eldritch Blast.

2660
01:42:18.305 --> 01:42:19.730
MATT: (laughs)

2661
01:42:20.677 --> 01:42:24.260
TRAVIS: Nope, I'm sorry, this is the wrong thing. 1d10.

2662
01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.870
That is, wow, six points of Eldritch Blast damage.

2663
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:30.460
MATT: Six points of Eldritch Blast damage.

2664
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:33.420
It impacts the creature. (snarling) looks over towards you,

2665
01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:35.370
its tiny little pointed teeth just upside

2666
01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:37.700
down triangular jaw. It's hurt very bad,

2667
01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.667
but it's still alive.
TRAVIS: Number two.

2668
01:42:39.667 --> 01:42:40.910
MATT: (growling)

2669
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:41.743
TRAVIS: 26 to hit.

2670
01:42:41.743 --> 01:42:42.987
MATT: Roll damage on that one.

2671
01:42:42.987 --> 01:42:44.600
TRAVIS: Do better.

2672
01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.090
What the fuck?

2673
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:50.440
That's two ones on a d10 in a row!

2674
01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.780
Six.

2675
01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:55.027
MATT: It crouches down and mid-air is blasted

2676
01:42:55.027 --> 01:42:57.260
into six different pieces.

2677
01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:59.750
Scattered across the interior of the cavern.

2678
01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:01.030
TRAVIS: Not useless!

2679
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:02.560
MATT: That finishes

2680
01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.000
your turn, Fjord?
TRAVIS: Yep.

2681
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.242
MATT: All right.

2682
01:43:05.242 --> 01:43:06.446
Top of the round.

2683
01:43:06.446 --> 01:43:11.070
The creature that had been noticed by you

2684
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:12.620
sees you rushing up towards it.

2685
01:43:13.710 --> 01:43:15.988
It's going to go ahead and fly.

2686
01:43:15.988 --> 01:43:17.594
MARISHA: No no no no!

2687
01:43:17.594 --> 01:43:19.090
LIAM: Come on, Barry Allen.

2688
01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:20.630
MARISHA: Does she--?
MATT: She is not within range.

2689
01:43:20.630 --> 01:43:23.580
You are just out of range and disappears around the corner.

2690
01:43:24.602 --> 01:43:25.726
LIAM: Run, Forrest.

2691
01:43:31.535 --> 01:43:35.684
MATT: Yeah, that's going to be it for that one.

2692
01:43:36.526 --> 01:43:38.410
That's their turn.

2693
01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:39.243
Yasha, her go.

2694
01:43:42.138 --> 01:43:45.305
TRAVIS: She saw a winged run around, right?

2695
01:43:45.305 --> 01:43:47.571
MATT: Well, technically, yeah,

2696
01:43:47.571 --> 01:43:48.404
because it did not go stealth.

2697
01:43:48.404 --> 01:43:53.179
You guys did all see this winged fiendish female

2698
01:43:53.179 --> 01:43:55.860
dart out from out of the corner of the chamber

2699
01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.150
and just fly and flutter off down and curving around

2700
01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:00.150
the hallway, out of sight.

2701
01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:02.517
TRAVIS: She will turn around and she will take her first

2702
01:44:02.517 --> 01:44:05.170
swipe at the nearest gizmo.

2703
01:44:05.170 --> 01:44:08.050
MATT: Okay, she has poisons, disadvantage on her attacks.

2704
01:44:08.050 --> 01:44:09.730
TRAVIS: Oh, wow, really?

2705
01:44:09.730 --> 01:44:11.240
That sucks.

2706
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:13.500
MATT: You can do reckless if you want to, but--

2707
01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:14.700
TRAVIS: Shit, I didn't say it.

2708
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:18.302
First one is a 15 to hit.

2709
01:44:18.302 --> 01:44:19.385
MATT: 15 still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

2710
01:44:19.385 --> 01:44:20.426
TRAVIS: Nice.

2711
01:44:21.806 --> 01:44:22.806
Divine fury.

2712
01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:26.200
Oh, nice, six, 10, 12.

2713
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:31.170
15, 17 points of slashing damage.

2714
01:44:31.170 --> 01:44:33.300
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage.

2715
01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:36.370
It just carves it in two, and you watch as the two

2716
01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:38.563
halves of it float.

2717
01:44:38.563 --> 01:44:40.210
One dart, scatters off the far wall

2718
01:44:40.210 --> 01:44:43.180
before landing on the ground, and it still moving.

2719
01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.250
TRAVIS: Yasha will use the upswing momentum

2720
01:44:45.250 --> 01:44:47.910
to take a step forward and carry through the blade

2721
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:48.743
into the second one.

2722
01:44:48.743 --> 01:44:49.576
MATT: Go for it.

2723
01:44:51.883 --> 01:44:53.270
TRAVIS: Not reckless.

2724
01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:56.590
MATT: So still disadvantage.
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, yep.

2725
01:44:58.110 --> 01:45:00.780
TRAVIS: Eight, so 14.
MATT: 14 hits.

2726
01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:01.880
TRAVIS: Nice.

2727
01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.713
Two D6.

2728
01:45:03.966 --> 01:45:07.930
Seven, nine, 11 points of damage.

2729
01:45:07.930 --> 01:45:10.260
MATT: 11 points of damage. Just cleaning them out,

2730
01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:13.160
step by step, boosh, boosh, both of them

2731
01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.340
are just scattered across the bottom of the stone interior

2732
01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.173
of the chamber.

2733
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:19.440
Nothing seems to be immediately threatening you,

2734
01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.920
as Yasha finishes her turn.

2735
01:45:22.330 --> 01:45:25.170
There's a moment where you all take a breath.

2736
01:45:26.712 --> 01:45:31.150
First off, in this moment, there is no combat.

2737
01:45:32.770 --> 01:45:35.313
LAURA: What the fuck, Caleb?
LIAM: What.

2738
01:45:35.313 --> 01:45:40.313
He-- She-- They got in my head. I'm sorry.

2739
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:44.680
LAURA: I take a step down and walk over towards Fjord.

2740
01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:47.220
MARISHA: They're still here. They went around the corner.

2741
01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:48.895
SAM: We have to keep--

2742
01:45:48.895 --> 01:45:50.103
MATT: 12 seconds off your haste.

2743
01:45:50.103 --> 01:45:53.042
MARISHA: Remember, they're resistant to all the elemental

2744
01:45:53.042 --> 01:45:55.450
shit and non-magical shit.

2745
01:45:55.450 --> 01:45:57.900
LIAM: Find them, Beauregard.
MARISHA: I'm going to go!

2746
01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:58.849
LAURA: I'm around the corner.

2747
01:45:58.849 --> 01:46:00.100
MARISHA: I run, as well,

2748
01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.262
with my hasted.

2749
01:46:03.262 --> 01:46:05.600
Cocaine fueled fury.

2750
01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.550
TALIESIN: I was going to try and cast a healing spell

2751
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:10.622
before everybody buggered off with a bonus action.

2752
01:46:10.622 --> 01:46:12.730
If I still have time.

2753
01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:15.490
MATT: I'll let you guys all do one action,

2754
01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:17.740
aside from Beauregard who just darts ahead.

2755
01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:20.170
LIAM: I'll just get a little bit up forward past Fjord

2756
01:46:20.170 --> 01:46:21.990
a hair, where he is right now.
MATT: Okay.

2757
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:24.846
TALIESIN: Mass healing word, at fourth level.

2758
01:46:24.846 --> 01:46:25.990
MATT: Sure.

2759
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:30.990
TALIESIN: Everyone gets 13 points back.

2760
01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:33.853
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

2761
01:46:33.853 --> 01:46:36.578
TALIESIN: Except for Nott,

2762
01:46:36.578 --> 01:46:39.430
who gets nine points back.

2763
01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.290
LIAM: Seems like a waste.

2764
01:46:43.798 --> 01:46:44.673
MARISHA: I left.

2765
01:46:44.673 --> 01:46:47.730
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you probably didn't get any.

2766
01:46:47.730 --> 01:46:50.378
He's like, I'm going to cast it and you let it go.

2767
01:46:50.378 --> 01:46:52.286
You moving ahead?

2768
01:46:52.286 --> 01:46:55.200
TALIESIN: I'm heading towards Yasha, so.

2769
01:46:56.230 --> 01:46:57.440
MATT: Yasha's right there.

2770
01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.640
TALIESIN: On my next turn, I'm going to

2771
01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.981
get rid of that poison.

2772
01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:02.378
MATT: Okay, Yasha's moving ahead or she's staying put?

2773
01:47:02.378 --> 01:47:04.290
TRAVIS: She's--
MATT: Beau darts past.

2774
01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:05.840
TRAVIS: Yeah, she's moving ahead, as well.

2775
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:09.646
MATT: Yeah, Yasha can get up there with her movement.

2776
01:47:09.646 --> 01:47:11.170
Do you want to use the rest of your movement to

2777
01:47:11.170 --> 01:47:12.003
try and get up with her?

2778
01:47:12.003 --> 01:47:12.836
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2779
01:47:12.836 --> 01:47:15.455
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: My speed is doubled,

2780
01:47:15.455 --> 01:47:16.770
by the way.
MATT: Correct.

2781
01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:18.602
MARISHA: It's haste, so--
MATT: You can keep moving,

2782
01:47:18.602 --> 01:47:20.093
if you want to.
MARISHA: Do I see them?

2783
01:47:20.093 --> 01:47:21.516
MATT: I'll get to that once everyone else figures out

2784
01:47:21.516 --> 01:47:22.616
what they're doing.

2785
01:47:22.616 --> 01:47:23.749
TRAVIS: If Yasha's feeling the (heartbeat),

2786
01:47:23.749 --> 01:47:25.020
she probably knows she's been poisoned?

2787
01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.483
MATT: Yeah.

2788
01:47:26.483 --> 01:47:27.982
She's been poisoned before. She knows the sensation.

2789
01:47:27.982 --> 01:47:29.170
TRAVIS: She'll stay back with Caduceus because ow.

2790
01:47:29.170 --> 01:47:31.530
MATT: Okay, so she'll stay, we'll say about there.

2791
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:33.610
She gets a few steps and is like.

2792
01:47:33.610 --> 01:47:35.400
Okay, that finishes that go.

2793
01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.490
Nott, what are you doing?

2794
01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.390
SAM: If only we had four vials of poison healing.

2795
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:41.370
In your pocket.
TRAVIS: Whose pocket?

2796
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:42.570
SAM: Yours.
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

2797
01:47:42.570 --> 01:47:44.730
SAM: Yeah, we just bought them from a bunch of kobolds

2798
01:47:44.730 --> 01:47:47.163
in a robe.

2799
01:47:47.163 --> 01:47:48.004
MATT: You did.

2800
01:47:48.004 --> 01:47:48.837
TRAVIS: Nice.

2801
01:47:48.837 --> 01:47:50.445
SAM: I'll cast invisibility

2802
01:47:50.445 --> 01:47:52.265
and follow around the corner.

2803
01:47:52.265 --> 01:47:54.595
MATT: All right, casting invisibility on himself

2804
01:47:54.595 --> 01:47:57.350
and five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 will get you about there

2805
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:59.960
next to Yasha.
SAM: Bonus action keep moving.

2806
01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.970
MATT: All right, and you are invisible, technically,

2807
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:04.300
so I will go ahead and use this.

2808
01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:07.130
Bonus action, keep moving. You move up here.

2809
01:48:07.130 --> 01:48:09.380
We'll put you up about there in this space.

2810
01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:10.730
You'll find out where Beau is.

2811
01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.710
All right, that finishes your turn.

2812
01:48:14.710 --> 01:48:15.543
Jester, what are you doing?

2813
01:48:15.543 --> 01:48:17.210
LAURA: I was planning on running around the corner,

2814
01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:19.450
whatever way I can get around past her, yeah.

2815
01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.120
LIAM: Boosh, boosh, boosh, boosh.

2816
01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.660
MATT: 25, 30, that's your movement.

2817
01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:26.658
LAURA: Can I use my action to run around, too?

2818
01:48:26.658 --> 01:48:27.732
MATT: Yeah, you can.

2819
01:48:27.732 --> 01:48:30.650
Five, 10, 15, 20, 30 is where you get there.

2820
01:48:30.650 --> 01:48:31.483
LAURA: Okay.

2821
01:48:31.483 --> 01:48:33.683
MATT: Fjord, where are you going?

2822
01:48:33.683 --> 01:48:35.230
TRAVIS: I'll go to the left, as well.

2823
01:48:36.110 --> 01:48:38.720
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

2824
01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.315
TRAVIS: Fine, I'll-- yeah.

2825
01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:45.105
MATT: 25, 30 will get you right there.

2826
01:48:45.105 --> 01:48:50.105
As you guys curve around the corner,

2827
01:48:52.835 --> 01:48:55.593
there's another red flash that catches your attention.

2828
01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.230
Over on the edge, Beauregard, you see the winged woman

2829
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:03.860
that you were chasing around the edge is standing off,

2830
01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:06.310
next to where the flash seemed to erupt from.

2831
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:08.180
The flash, it maintains.

2832
01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:11.541
You watch as a heavy hand pushes through

2833
01:49:11.541 --> 01:49:16.541
and another heavy hoofed foot steps through.

2834
01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:20.630
You watch as this demonic snout with curved horns

2835
01:49:20.630 --> 01:49:23.890
bull like, but red and demonic it seems,

2836
01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:27.020
tears through with big wings that flare out from it.

2837
01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:29.730
You can see these like giant leather gauntlets

2838
01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:34.370
of some sort of strange hide with metal rivets

2839
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:36.240
built across the knuckles and the fists

2840
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.877
adorned its clawed hands as it pulls through

2841
01:49:38.877 --> 01:49:43.342
and looks to the side at the other creature and goes,

2842
01:49:43.342 --> 01:49:44.825
"Is it ready?"

2843
01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.300
SAM: Is it ready?

2844
01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.690
MATT: As it glances over and sees

2845
01:49:48.690 --> 01:49:49.909
the rest of you standing there,

2846
01:49:49.909 --> 01:49:51.022
that's where we'll pick it back up.

2847
01:49:51.022 --> 01:49:53.372
(yelling)

2848
01:49:53.372 --> 01:49:55.413
SAM: Is that a pit fiend? What is that?!

2849
01:49:55.413 --> 01:49:57.254
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

2850
01:49:57.254 --> 01:49:58.421
MARISHA: I wonder if it's a goristro.

2851
01:49:58.421 --> 01:49:59.642
TRAVIS: It's the minotaur.

2852
01:49:59.642 --> 01:50:02.800
(yelling)

2853
01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.106
LAURA: So I could see?

2854
01:50:04.106 --> 01:50:05.873
Oh, fuck.

2855
01:50:05.873 --> 01:50:07.530
Is it all the way through? Is it all the way out?

2856
01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:10.288
MATT: It's all the way through. As you guys were

2857
01:50:10.288 --> 01:50:11.990
rushing around that edge.

2858
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:13.547
LIAM: I'm so tapped.

2859
01:50:13.547 --> 01:50:15.580
LAURA: That's because you used a 4th-level fucking

2860
01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:16.428
spell on us.

2861
01:50:16.428 --> 01:50:18.403
LIAM: It was for a good cause, though.

2862
01:50:18.403 --> 01:50:20.003
MATT: Right here are the two.

2863
01:50:20.003 --> 01:50:22.178
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2864
01:50:22.178 --> 01:50:23.761
SAM: They're still together.

2865
01:50:23.761 --> 01:50:25.760
We'll just do some Fireballs, they'll be dead

2866
01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:26.960
in like two rounds. It's great.

2867
01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:29.026
TRAVIS: Who has Fireball? Not us.

2868
01:50:29.026 --> 01:50:32.163
TALIESIN: I mean, don't we already know

2869
01:50:32.163 --> 01:50:34.720
that fire doesn't do anything to these people?

2870
01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.620
MARISHA: Once again, I already said, resistant.

2871
01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:38.395
LIAM: Theories after the break.

2872
01:50:38.395 --> 01:50:39.365
MATT: Yes, theories at the break.

2873
01:50:39.365 --> 01:50:40.532
Anyway, guys, we'll be back here in just a minute

2874
01:50:40.532 --> 01:50:43.310
to see where the next step of this battle takes place.

2875
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:46.020
We do have our giveaway from our friends

2876
01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.190

2877
01:50:47.190 --> 01:50:48.901
I'll open this up here for you.

2878
01:50:48.901 --> 01:50:51.909
We have-- ooh.

2879
01:50:51.909 --> 01:50:52.942
TRAVIS: It's the one I have.

2880
01:50:52.942 --> 01:50:54.330
MATT: A beautiful Bolivian rosewood

2881
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:56.160

ASHLEY: Hello, Critterverse.

2910
01:52:09.178 --> 01:52:14.090
Since our last update, you all have helped us conquer

2911
01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:16.750
some pretty amazing milestones, and we just wanted

2912
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:17.978
to share them with you.

2913
01:52:17.978 --> 01:52:21.740
What? Are you kidding me? That is bonkers.

2914
01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:26.290
The Legend of Vox Machina has become the most funded

2915
01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:29.440
film project in Kickstarter history.

2916
01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.389
We are sitting at Number 10, for most funded project

2917
01:52:34.389 --> 01:52:36.682
on Kickstarter of all time.

2918
01:52:36.682 --> 01:52:40.220
That's crazy.

2919
01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:43.530
You all have banded together to make this happen

2920
01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:47.190
and we are all completely blown away,

2921
01:52:47.190 --> 01:52:51.346
so thank you so much for your love and support.

2922
01:52:51.346 --> 01:52:55.100
It means the absolute world to us.

2923
01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:55.970
Thank you.

2924
01:52:55.970 --> 01:53:00.957
Now we can make the Vox Machina cartoon of our dreams,

2925
01:53:00.957 --> 01:53:02.968
so thank you again.

2926
01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:07.040
We would also like to give a special shout out to

01:53:28.770 --> 01:53:30.630
keep loving each other. (kiss) Bye.

2935
01:53:32.101 --> 01:53:34.650
LIAM: Are we going to talk about the dark horse in the room?

2936
01:53:34.650 --> 01:53:37.960
TALEISN: You mean how Vox Machina Origins, our comic series,

2937
01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:40.580
published by Dark Horse is making its triumphant return

2938
01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.290
for another six issue run on July 10th?

2939
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:43.830
LIAM: No.
TALIESIN: You mean how

2940
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:46.470
the comic series will be available in comic book shops

2941
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:48.292
and on Dark Horse Digital.
LIAM: No?

2942
01:53:48.292 --> 01:53:51.117
TALIESIN: Surely you must have been referring to how

2943
01:53:51.117 --> 01:53:53.770
our friend Jody Houser, who is, of course, known for her

2944
01:53:53.770 --> 01:53:55.962
work on Orphan Black and the Stranger Things comic

2945
01:53:55.962 --> 01:53:58.710
will be penning the series, and we've also got

2946
01:53:58.710 --> 01:54:01.427
colorist MSassyK and letterer Ariana Maher

2947
01:54:01.427 --> 01:54:03.264
joining our creative team, as well as the return of

2948
01:54:03.264 --> 01:54:05.730
critter artist, Olivia Samson.

2949
01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:07.396
Surely, that was it.

2950
01:54:07.396 --> 01:54:08.854
LIAM: No! How are you missing this?

2951
01:54:08.854 --> 01:54:10.200
TALIESIN: You're probably talking

2952
01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:13.210
about how our first six issue run comic book series

2953
01:54:13.210 --> 01:54:15.130
will be available via trade paperback

2954
01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:17.780
for the first time ever--
LIAM: Holy shit, that is cool,

2955
01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:20.410
but it's still not what I am talking about, Taliesin.

2956
01:54:20.410 --> 01:54:21.570
TALIESIN: Katy Perry?
LIAM: What?

2957
01:54:21.570 --> 01:54:24.065
TALIESIN: Oh, you mean the announcement about our next

2958
01:54:24.065 --> 01:54:26.160
art book that Dark Horse will be publishing called

2959
01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.640
The Chronicles of Exandria: The Mighty Nein.

2960
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.790
LIAM: Holy shit, that is really cool.

2961
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:32.480
But it is still not what we are talking about.

2962
01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:35.155
The dark horse in the room.

2963
01:54:35.155 --> 01:54:35.988
TALIESIN: Oh.

2964
01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:38.320
Oh, that's Biscuit.

2965
01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.080
Hey, Biscuit.
BISCUIT: Hey, Tal.

2966
01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.460
TALIESIN: What you working on over there?

2967
01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:43.320
BISCUIT: Just my memoirs, you know.

2968
01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:47.030
TALIESIN: That'll make fascinating reading, my good man.

2969
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:48.296
(low aside) Say something nice, man.

2970
01:54:48.296 --> 01:54:49.129
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sure--

2971
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:50.610
TALIESIN: Louder.
LIAM: You've been blessed

2972
01:54:50.610 --> 01:54:52.426
with a very incredible life.

2973
01:54:52.426 --> 01:54:53.742
BISCUIT: The horse is funny to you?

2974
01:54:53.742 --> 01:54:56.300
LIAM: Oh, don't take it-- I'm sorry, that's really cool

2975
01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:57.810
that you're writing a horse memoir.

2976
01:54:57.810 --> 01:55:00.360
TALIESIN: To be or not to be, that is the equestrian.

2977
01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.832
Free book title.

2978
01:55:02.832 --> 01:55:07.832
(ethereal music)

2979
01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:16.930
TRAVIS (VO): Previously on MAME Drop.

2980
01:55:16.930 --> 01:55:18.973
TALIESIN: You guys know about Comix Zone?

2981
01:55:18.973 --> 01:55:20.722
AMY: He's so extreme!

2982
01:55:20.722 --> 01:55:22.088
TALIESIN: He's so-- he's got

2983
01:55:22.088 --> 01:55:24.310
so much ponytail.
AMY Yeah.

2984
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:28.362
TALIESIN: This is '90s comic book the game.

2985
01:55:28.362 --> 01:55:30.240
What, oh no.

2986
01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.310
"Look at me, Sketch. I'm a drawing,

2987
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:33.720
"but I'll be free soon enough,

2988
01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.770
"and as soon as you're dead.

2989
01:55:35.770 --> 01:55:37.478
"I cannot kill you here, but I know a

2990
01:55:37.478 --> 01:55:39.240
"perfect place to do it."

2991
01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:40.760
AMY: Have a nice trip.

2992
01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:42.040
TALIESIN: This is our turf.

2993
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:44.730
AMY: Okay, this rules.
TALIESIN: Do you want to be

2994
01:55:45.597 --> 01:55:48.003
the very first to pull-- to see what happens?

2995
01:55:48.003 --> 01:55:49.436
AMY: Yes!

2996
01:55:49.436 --> 01:55:50.494
TALIESIN: Magic gumball machine.

2997
01:55:50.494 --> 01:55:52.581
Wow, gumball got expensive.

2998
01:55:52.581 --> 01:55:55.270
All right, here we go.
AMY: Okay, okay.

2999
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:56.430
TALIESIN: I don't actually know if this is going to work.

3000
01:55:56.430 --> 01:55:57.680
It'll be great.

3001
01:56:00.159 --> 01:56:02.440
All right.

3002
01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:05.476
What'd you get?
AMY: Yes! (yelling)

3003
01:56:05.476 --> 01:56:07.230
TALIESIN: They're a little hard to open, I do know that,

3004
01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:08.530
too, which is pretty hilarious.

3005
01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:10.990
AMY: Oh, dang!

3006
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:13.108
Tiny bear stickers!

3007
01:56:13.108 --> 01:56:15.160
TALIESIN: You got tiny bear stickers, well done.

3008
01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.580
Oh, here, we can, tiny bear stickers.

3009
01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:18.938
TRAVIS (VO): (southern accent) Last time on

3010
01:56:18.938 --> 01:56:20.688
Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

3011
01:56:20.688 --> 01:56:22.888
MARISHA: (southern accent) Howdy, boys.

3012
01:56:22.888 --> 01:56:23.721
BRIAN: What the hell?

3013
01:56:23.721 --> 01:56:26.890
MARISHA: I can't thank you enough for giving me breath.

3014
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:31.820
What was the name you gave me to awaken my soul?

3015
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:35.960
BRIAN: It's the armadillo we named two weeks ago.

3016
01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.493
It's Root N Toot N Ruby.

3017
01:56:37.493 --> 01:56:39.451
MARISHA: Root N Toot N Ruby?

3018
01:56:39.451 --> 01:56:43.621
Well, hell, that's got more kick than sour sarsaparilla

3019
01:56:43.621 --> 01:56:45.450
on a hot day.

3020
01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:49.500
There are other critters out here who need names.

3021
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.115
BRIAN: Oh, yeah, we do have a bunch.

3022
01:56:51.115 --> 01:56:52.130
MARISHA: Speak them

3023
01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:55.882
and they will return, just like me.

3024
01:56:55.882 --> 01:56:59.020
So dust off your boots and enjoy those games, boys.

3025
01:57:00.050 --> 01:57:02.220
But remember the prophecy.

3026
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:05.096
BRIAN: The what?
TRAVIS: Prophecy?

3027
01:57:05.096 --> 01:57:07.487
MARISHA: (eerily) The prophecy.

3028
01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:08.487
TRAVIS: What--? Do you--?

3029
01:57:08.487 --> 01:57:10.200
What are you doing with the?

3030
01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.021
BRIAN: What the hell?

3031
01:57:12.021 --> 01:57:12.917
All right.

3032
01:57:12.917 --> 01:57:15.010
Kimothy was raised in Venice.

3033
01:57:15.010 --> 01:57:18.708
Today's actually the first day he's ever left Venice.

3034
01:57:18.708 --> 01:57:23.018
Sometimes he gets in trouble because of the way he looks.

3035
01:57:25.176 --> 01:57:28.668
He's basically modeled after the drummer from Sevendust,

3036
01:57:28.668 --> 01:57:33.030
which is a super deep cut for some of the fans out there.

3037
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:35.658
But yeah, he killed both of his parents a couple years ago

3038
01:57:35.658 --> 01:57:37.830
and he's been on the run ever since then.

3039
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:40.750
He's allergic to cheese but he loves other dairy products.

3040
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:41.583
Like milk.

3041
01:57:41.583 --> 01:57:43.490
(cow mooing)
TRAVIS: One second.

3042
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:44.585
BRIAN: (laughing) That's good.

3043
01:57:44.585 --> 01:57:46.880
That's Kimothy in a nutshell.

3044
01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:48.920
All right, up first, hey.

3045
01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:49.950
Hey, hold off.

3046
01:57:50.821 --> 01:57:52.810
TRAVIS: I got a lot of flack for my Cheeto throwing.

3047
01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:56.602
Or my cheese puff finger throwing.

3048
01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:57.900
I want you to know, I've been working on it.

3049
01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.738
A one, a two--

3050
01:57:59.738 --> 01:58:01.160
BRIAN: Wait, but these are bigger ones than last time.

3051
01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:03.170
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, no problem.

3052
01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:06.370
BRIAN: That landed on my shoe.

3053
01:58:06.370 --> 01:58:07.820
TRAVIS: Oh, it did!

3054
01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:09.820
BRIAN: Dude, you don't know where my shoes have been.

3055
01:58:10.824 --> 01:58:12.093
TRAVIS: (quietly) Damn it.

3056
01:58:12.093 --> 01:58:15.300
Here, I'll throw it and catch it.

3057
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:17.500
BRIAN: Where are you, sir?
TRAVIS: I'm just down here.

3058
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:20.753
I'm right here.

3059
01:58:20.753 --> 01:58:25.725
(laughter)

3060
01:58:25.725 --> 01:58:28.600
(laughter)

3061
01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:29.804
(gasping)

3062
01:58:29.804 --> 01:58:32.704
TRAVIS: Ooh. Pig sooie!

3063
01:58:32.704 --> 01:58:37.480
LIAM: Subscribe or don't subscribe.

3064
01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:41.520
That's not a question.

3065
01:58:44.130 --> 01:58:46.580
Whether it is nobler in the mind to ponder

3066
01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:50.230
the pros and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime.

3067
01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:55.230
Or to take hands and gift new subs to critters

3068
01:58:55.230 --> 01:58:56.960
who find they can't afford them.

3069
01:58:59.070 --> 01:59:03.560
To play, to sleep.

3070
01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:06.593
No more.

3071
01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:11.040
And by asleep to say the cast and crew

3072
01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.010
of Critical Role might find their naps

3073
01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:16.028
around the hectic schedule of a live broadcast

3074
01:59:16.028 --> 01:59:18.391
that we have brought for your consumption

3075
01:59:18.391 --> 01:59:20.930
both critter and fan alike.

3076
01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:24.913
To play.

3077
01:59:26.290 --> 01:59:27.123
Or sleep.

3078
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:32.540
No sleep.

3079
01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:34.000
But just to stream.

3080
01:59:36.130 --> 01:59:37.360
Aye, there's the rub.

3081
01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:43.805
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

3082
01:59:47.868 --> 01:59:50.230
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tag line.

3083
01:59:50.230 --> 01:59:51.063
Do we got that?

3084
01:59:52.323 --> 01:59:53.156
Oh.

3085
01:59:53.156 --> 01:59:54.150
That is Twitch poetry.

3086
01:59:57.426 --> 01:59:58.780
Oh, anyway.

3087
01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:01.140
Subscribe to Critical Role.

3088
02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:03.210
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

3089
02:00:03.210 --> 02:00:04.700
Gift some subscriptions.

3090
02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:06.667
You-- you got it.

3091
02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.930
Wrong soliloquy for the skull,

3092
02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:16.028
but that's fucking good.

3093
02:00:16.028 --> 02:00:21.028
(classical music)

3094
02:00:21.607 --> 02:00:26.315
(dramatic music)

3095
02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:34.100
MATT: And welcome back.

3096
02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:36.360
Our winner for tonight, for the fantastic

3097
02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:40.440
Wyrmwood giveaway is King_Wataba.

3098
02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.800
King_Wataba, congratulations.

3099
02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:44.810
We will have that sent to you ASAP.

3100
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:49.520
To get into the speed of things,

3101
02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.038
let's roll a new initiative,

3102
02:13:51.038 --> 02:13:52.658
since we're now in the secondary combat.

3103
02:13:53.767 --> 02:13:56.073
TRAVIS: Sure they won't just retreat and leave?

3104
02:13:56.073 --> 02:13:57.348
MARISHA: New initiative.

3105
02:13:57.348 --> 02:13:58.230
MATT: All right.

3106
02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:59.647
LAURA: Whoa. What is it?

3107
02:13:59.647 --> 02:14:00.952
SAM: Awesome. Great.

3108
02:14:00.952 --> 02:14:02.302
LIAM: Oh, that's shit!

3109
02:14:02.302 --> 02:14:03.135
MATT: Ooh.

3110
02:14:03.135 --> 02:14:04.804
MARISHA: Almost a nat 20.
LIAM: You're fast.

3111
02:14:04.804 --> 02:14:06.224
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: I'm okay.

3112
02:14:06.224 --> 02:14:09.615
SAM: I looked down at your phone and saw the craziest thing.

3113
02:14:09.615 --> 02:14:12.123
LAURA: Yeah, I know. What is this thing--

3114
02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:16.315
MATT: So. 25 to 20.

3115
02:14:16.315 --> 02:14:18.870
TRAVIS: It's not my day. Or Yasha's.

3116
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:21.828
MATT: Nobody, all righty. 20 to 15.

3117
02:14:21.828 --> 02:14:22.840
LAURA: 17.

3118
02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:23.673
LIAM: 15.

3119
02:14:23.673 --> 02:14:24.506
MATT: All right.

3120
02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:30.388
Jester has 17.
LAURA: Yeah.

3121
02:14:30.388 --> 02:14:31.730
MATT: All right.

3122
02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:32.829
SAM: She's going to fuck shit up!

3123
02:14:32.829 --> 02:14:34.590
TRAVIS: This is our third initiative of the day, by the way.

3124
02:14:34.590 --> 02:14:36.170
SAM: Much pie out there.

3125
02:14:36.170 --> 02:14:37.080
The pie was so great.

3126
02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.430
LAURA: I already had a piece of pie.

3127
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:42.205
MATT: Then Caleb was 15?
LIAM: Yeah.

3128
02:14:42.205 --> 02:14:43.655
SAM: Two kinds of pie.

3129
02:14:43.655 --> 02:14:44.770
LAURA: I ate it!

3130
02:14:44.770 --> 02:14:45.992
SAM: You don't like pie?

3131
02:14:45.992 --> 02:14:46.853
LAURA: I ate it.

3132
02:14:46.853 --> 02:14:49.230
MATT: 15 to 10.

3133
02:14:49.230 --> 02:14:51.050
TALIESIN: 14.
MARISHA: 13.

3134
02:14:51.050 --> 02:14:52.290
MATT: All righty, Caduceus.

3135
02:14:52.290 --> 02:14:55.190
MARISHA: This is the day that Caduceus beats Beau

3136
02:14:56.364 --> 02:14:57.197
in initiative.

3137
02:14:57.197 --> 02:14:58.030
MATT: 10 to five.

3138
02:14:58.030 --> 02:15:00.950
♪ Caduceus beats Beau ♪

3139
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:02.450
TRAVIS: Fjord had an 11.

3140
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:03.540
MATT: All right.

3141
02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:04.680
MARISHA: I was leaning into the topic.

3142
02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:05.820
SAM: Eight.

3143
02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.536
MATT: Eight for Nott.

3144
02:15:07.536 --> 02:15:08.730
TRAVIS: Yasha had a nine.

3145
02:15:08.730 --> 02:15:09.563
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

3146
02:15:09.563 --> 02:15:11.260
MARISHA: <i>Nein</i>.
MATT: <i>Nine</i>!

3147
02:15:12.698 --> 02:15:14.824
TRAVIS: So Nott's at the bottom with eight.

3148
02:15:14.824 --> 02:15:16.640
MATT: I'll write that again.

3149
02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:19.090
LIAM: I'm the paintbrush, Matthew's the artist.

3150
02:15:19.090 --> 02:15:24.090
MATT: All righty, so, as you watch this deep

3151
02:15:24.118 --> 02:15:27.770
brown-gray, thick leather-skinned demonic creature

3152
02:15:27.770 --> 02:15:31.820
step through, the top of this cavern space

3153
02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:34.440
is about 15 feet tall and this creature is almost

3154
02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.950
having to hunch down with its wings extended

3155
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:38.550
out in front.

3156
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:40.700
You can see it carries no weapon, but has these

3157
02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:44.000
heavy claws and these metal studded

3158
02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.850
leather gauntlets that fit over them.

3159
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:48.980
The two other entities are currently there,

3160
02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:51.630
awaiting its arrival, and noticing your presence.

3161
02:15:51.630 --> 02:15:54.258
Top of the round is Jester, simultaneously,

3162
02:15:54.258 --> 02:15:56.910
with what you've now come to realize is to be,

3163
02:15:56.910 --> 02:15:59.410
through Beau's help, a succubus and an incubus.

3164
02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:02.256
What is your dexterity modifier?

3165
02:16:02.256 --> 02:16:03.930
LAURA: Plus four.
MATT: Plus four?

3166
02:16:03.930 --> 02:16:05.900
LAURA: Oh, my modifier, yeah.

3167
02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:06.990
MATT: Plus four for your dexterity modifier.

3168
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:08.031
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3169
02:16:08.031 --> 02:16:09.444
MATT: All right. You're going first.

3170
02:16:09.444 --> 02:16:10.631
You actually go before they do.

3171
02:16:10.631 --> 02:16:11.637
You're a little quicker

3172
02:16:11.637 --> 02:16:12.772
than they are, even though you're on the same initiative.

3173
02:16:12.772 --> 02:16:13.605
What are you doing first?

3174
02:16:13.605 --> 02:16:17.288
LAURA: I'm going to see this giant thing come out of

3175
02:16:17.288 --> 02:16:20.095
the giant slit in the wall and I'm going to,

3176
02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.000
having seen this before, I'm going to cast Banishment on it.

3177
02:16:26.503 --> 02:16:27.977
(applauding)

3178
02:16:27.977 --> 02:16:29.445
MATT: Okay! what's the DC on this?

3179
02:16:29.445 --> 02:16:32.315
LAURA: Charisma of 16.

3180
02:16:32.315 --> 02:16:33.575
MATT: Charisma, 16.

3181
02:16:33.575 --> 02:16:36.190
SAM: Not very charismatic.
MATT: All right, that is 11.

3182
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:39.010
However, it does have advantage on its magical saving throws

3183
02:16:39.010 --> 02:16:40.560
as it is resistant to magic.

3184
02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:43.493
That is 17.

3185
02:16:43.493 --> 02:16:44.629
(groaning)

3186
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:45.779
Succeeds, I'm so sorry.

3187
02:16:46.650 --> 02:16:49.950
You watch, as you step around and release the spell,

3188
02:16:49.950 --> 02:16:53.080
you watch as the strings of incantations

3189
02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:56.560
begin to spin around like chains and it glances down

3190
02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:00.500
and muscles 'em off and the spell shatters around it.

3191
02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:01.750
It turns towards you.

3192
02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:05.240
LAURA: (yelling)

3193
02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:07.060
I turn around to run away.

3194
02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:07.893
MATT: Okay.

3195
02:17:07.893 --> 02:17:08.867
All full movement?

3196
02:17:08.867 --> 02:17:09.700
LAURA: Yeah.

3197
02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:11.221
MARISHA: Fuck, that was almost so cool!

3198
02:17:11.221 --> 02:17:13.263
MATT: Almost.

3199
02:17:13.263 --> 02:17:15.294
All right, and that finishes your turn?

3200
02:17:15.294 --> 02:17:16.478
LAURA: (weakly) Uh huh.

3201
02:17:16.478 --> 02:17:17.794
MATT: All right. The--

3202
02:17:17.794 --> 02:17:19.630
TRAVIS: Got to take a shot, man.

3203
02:17:19.630 --> 02:17:20.463
Got to take a shot.

3204
02:17:20.463 --> 02:17:22.780
MATT: The woman, succubus, turns and sees your

3205
02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:25.618
coming around the forner--the corner, Fjord.

3206
02:17:25.618 --> 02:17:27.183
TRAVIS: The forner?

3207
02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:31.231
MATT: Looks, kinks its head and in your mind

3208
02:17:31.231 --> 02:17:34.527
you hear, "We haven't interfaced yet either.

3209
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:37.490
"Want to give us a hand, big boy?"

3210
02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:40.692
Take a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

3211
02:17:40.692 --> 02:17:42.580
TALIESIN: With advantage.
MATT: With advantage.

3212
02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:44.860
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm not going to do the thing.

3213
02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:46.887
All right, what is my saving throw?

3214
02:17:46.887 --> 02:17:47.720
SAM: You got this.

3215
02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:50.333
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
MATT: Oh.

3216
02:17:51.528 --> 02:17:52.380
TRAVIS: Total of 22.

3217
02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:53.720
MATT: All right, well done.
TRAVIS: Thank you, advantage.

3218
02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.547
Because the other one was a fucking three.

3219
02:17:57.547 --> 02:18:00.050
MATT: With that, angrily, it throws a small tantrum

3220
02:18:00.050 --> 02:18:03.099
before fluttering up and backing into this corner

3221
02:18:03.099 --> 02:18:06.370
to stay out of the middle of the fray.

3222
02:18:06.370 --> 02:18:10.417
The other one is going to go ahead and--let's see.

3223
02:18:12.279 --> 02:18:13.637
Turn.

3224
02:18:13.637 --> 02:18:18.062
(inaudible whispering)

3225
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:22.002
Yeah, it doesn't see any of you, so it's going to go ahead

3226
02:18:22.002 --> 02:18:25.100
and fly back into this wing.

3227
02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:26.600
It's going to hold its action.

3228
02:18:28.450 --> 02:18:30.380
That brings us to...

3229
02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:36.985
the creature that stepped through the portal.

3230
02:18:36.985 --> 02:18:39.280
All right.

3231
02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.400
First thing you watch it do.

3232
02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:45.440
It's looking over towards you, Jester,

3233
02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:47.760
grinning and seeing the rest of you swarm in.

3234
02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:52.420
It closes its fists and electricity begins to charge up

3235
02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:54.838
through the studs that are embedded in these

3236
02:18:54.838 --> 02:18:58.860
leather glove-like gauntlets that it has across its claws.

3237
02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:01.097
Arcs between the gloves for a second.

3238
02:19:01.097 --> 02:19:03.680
It's going to go ahead and first--

3239
02:19:06.242 --> 02:19:08.290
Yeah. It's going to step forward.

3240
02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:11.358
Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3241
02:19:12.228 --> 02:19:13.061
To there.

3242
02:19:13.061 --> 02:19:14.936
TRAVIS: Jesus, that's a lot of movement.

3243
02:19:14.936 --> 02:19:17.140
MATT: It's going do its multi attack.

3244
02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:18.730
Take three claw attacks.

3245
02:19:18.730 --> 02:19:20.930
Two against Fjord and one against Jester.

3246
02:19:20.930 --> 02:19:22.750
LAURA: He can reach that far?

3247
02:19:22.750 --> 02:19:24.510
MATT: The first attack's against you.

3248
02:19:24.510 --> 02:19:26.817
That is 26 to hit.

3249
02:19:26.817 --> 02:19:28.225
LAURA: (gasps)

3250
02:19:28.225 --> 02:19:30.330
MATT: Second attack is 20 to hit.

3251
02:19:30.330 --> 02:19:32.730
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
MATT: All righty, so.

3252
02:19:32.730 --> 02:19:35.160
MARISHA: Maybe we should reevaluate a few things.

3253
02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:39.420
MATT: The first strike does 18 points of slashing--

3254
02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:40.700
of lightning damage to you.

3255
02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:42.800
TRAVIS: 18 points of lightning damage.

3256
02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:45.100
MATT: Correct, as it carves towards you,

3257
02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:48.160
its claws turn into whatever electrical field is nearby

3258
02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:50.707
and just shocks through you.

3259
02:19:50.707 --> 02:19:54.604
The second one is going to be 16 points of lightning damage.

3260
02:19:54.604 --> 02:19:55.990
Through you.

3261
02:19:57.084 --> 02:19:59.690
Then it arcs its claw towards Jester,

3262
02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:01.969
and even though it's 20 feet away from you,

3263
02:20:01.969 --> 02:20:05.939
the lightning arcs 20 feet and goes towards you

3264
02:20:05.939 --> 02:20:08.972
to attempt to strike you for...

3265
02:20:08.972 --> 02:20:10.033
natural one.

3266
02:20:10.033 --> 02:20:10.866
LAURA: Yes.

3267
02:20:11.850 --> 02:20:13.800
MATT: Unfortunately, you're close enough to the stone

3268
02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:16.440
on the side of the chamber where the arc hits the rock

3269
02:20:16.440 --> 02:20:17.770
nearby, missing you by inches.

3270
02:20:17.770 --> 02:20:20.710
You can smell the scent of burning ozone in front of you

3271
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:22.880
and you see rocks dissipate

3272
02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:25.830
as the electricity manages to disperse amongst the stone

3273
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:27.330
on the side of the wall.

3274
02:20:27.330 --> 02:20:28.770
That finishes its turn.

3275
02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:32.710
That's going to bring us to Caleb's go.

3276
02:20:33.628 --> 02:20:37.347
LIAM: Okay, so I see lightning streaking past Jester,

3277
02:20:37.347 --> 02:20:41.110
so Caleb moves over this way to the exit

3278
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:46.110
and pulls out that body of an adder and draws it out again

3279
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:52.640
and a string of green acid forms between his two hands

3280
02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:57.310
and an acid arrow streaks out at big bull man.

3281
02:20:57.310 --> 02:20:59.620
MATT: All righty.
SAM: ♪ Big bull man! ♪

3282
02:21:00.978 --> 02:21:03.150
LIAM: Just a spell attack against him.

3283
02:21:04.114 --> 02:21:05.940
LIAM: Yeah, he has to make--
MATT: Or he makes a saving throw.

3284
02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:07.840
Which one?
LIAM: It is a save.

3285
02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:09.590
He gets damaged either way.

3286
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:11.680
MATT: Right, what is the save, dex or constitution?

3287
02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:13.760
LIAM: Hit the target to-- oh, I have to make a ranged--

3288
02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:15.523
MATT: That's what I was wondering.

3289
02:21:15.523 --> 02:21:17.160
It's a ranged spell attack, so roll.

3290
02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:19.640
LIAM: <i>Shite.</i>
MARISHA: That was so--

3291
02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:22.460
Now you roll like shit.
LIAM: 16.

3292
02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:23.590
MATT: 16 misses.

3293
02:21:24.495 --> 02:21:26.090
LIAM: It still takes damage.

3294
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:27.540
Just not as much.
MATT: Got you.

3295
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:32.330
LIAM: 44.

3296
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:33.220
Half of this.

3297
02:21:35.703 --> 02:21:37.250
Two, six, eight.

3298
02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:39.429
It takes five points of acid damage.

3299
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:41.104
MATT: Five points of acid damage to it.

3300
02:21:41.104 --> 02:21:43.170
As it manages to streak off the side of its wing

3301
02:21:43.170 --> 02:21:45.420
and then splatter, the acid burns down.

3302
02:21:45.420 --> 02:21:46.520
Does take full damage.

3303
02:21:50.490 --> 02:21:51.323
That finishes your turn?

3304
02:21:51.323 --> 02:21:52.526
LIAM: That's it, yeah.

3305
02:21:52.526 --> 02:21:54.085
MATT: All right, finishing Caleb's go.

3306
02:21:54.085 --> 02:21:55.315
That brings us to Caduceus.

3307
02:21:55.315 --> 02:21:56.395
Caduceus, what are you doing?

3308
02:21:56.395 --> 02:21:57.490
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a--

3309
02:21:57.490 --> 02:21:58.610
LAURA: Bane, Bane, Bane.

3310
02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:02.774
TALIESIN: Well, the problem with Bane is we drop

3311
02:22:02.774 --> 02:22:05.670
Beacon of Hope, so I can't do Bane.

3312
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:06.991
I'm also nowhere near there.

3313
02:22:06.991 --> 02:22:07.824
LAURA: Shit.

3314
02:22:07.824 --> 02:22:09.089
TALIESIN: I'm going to start with--

3315
02:22:09.089 --> 02:22:11.136
TRAVIS: Oh, this is getting better all the time.

3316
02:22:11.136 --> 02:22:13.235
TALIESIN: Where is it, Lesser Restoration?

3317
02:22:13.235 --> 02:22:17.000
I'm starting with a Lesser Restoration for the poison.

3318
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.060
MATT: Okay, so you reach out and grab Yasha,

3319
02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:21.160
and in doing so, you dash the poison from her system.

3320
02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:24.400
It burns away in a visible trail of smoke,

3321
02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:25.900
out of the wound.

3322
02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:28.110
Then the poison has been expunged.

3323
02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:30.882
TALIESIN: Okay, and I just have a bonus action and run left?

3324
02:22:30.882 --> 02:22:31.715
MATT: Correct.

3325
02:22:33.163 --> 02:22:36.640
TALIESIN: Yeah, I saw what Caleb's doing,

3326
02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.020
I'm going to head in that direction.

3327
02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:39.823
MATT: This way?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3328
02:22:39.823 --> 02:22:41.830
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3329
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:42.840
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Gets you there.

3330
02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.630
TALIESIN: Actually behind that, behind that thing,

3331
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:45.672
for a little cover.

3332
02:22:45.672 --> 02:22:46.677
MATT: Behind here?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3333
02:22:46.677 --> 02:22:47.832
MATT: All righty, you got it.

3334
02:22:47.832 --> 02:22:49.065
That finishes your go, Caduceus, that brings us

3335
02:22:49.065 --> 02:22:50.420
to Beau, Beauregard.

3336
02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:52.460
SAM: It's your go-regard.

3337
02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:53.860
MATT: It's your turn.

3338
02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:56.311
MARISHA: Déjà vu.

3339
02:22:56.311 --> 02:23:00.570
MATT: You see the two--the succubus and the incubus

3340
02:23:00.570 --> 02:23:02.630
across the way, one of them is curled into the corner,

3341
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:04.940
the other one seems to be lying in wait for something,

3342
02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:07.860
and the large demonic creature that pulled through

3343
02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:09.770
the portal--you can now see the tear

3344
02:23:09.770 --> 02:23:11.591
where it pushed through.

3345
02:23:11.591 --> 02:23:13.980
It's this still hovering rift in space.

3346
02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:17.259
It just turns to the left and then steps beyond

3347
02:23:17.259 --> 02:23:19.670
the chamber to the right.

3348
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:21.290
MARISHA: This is so much to deal with.

3349
02:23:22.808 --> 02:23:23.813
It feels like real life.

3350
02:23:23.813 --> 02:23:27.734
Move towards the succubus and incubus.

3351
02:23:27.734 --> 02:23:29.292
MATT: All righty.

3352
02:23:29.292 --> 02:23:31.067
MARISHA: As I have my double speed.

3353
02:23:31.067 --> 02:23:33.590
Which takes me to 90 feet.

3354
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:34.845
MATT: Where do you want to go?

3355
02:23:34.845 --> 02:23:36.804
Just point.

3356
02:23:36.804 --> 02:23:37.940
MARISHA: Is she going to be out of reach?

3357
02:23:37.940 --> 02:23:40.950
Is she high enough to where she's out of reach?

3358
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:42.265
MATT: She's up in the corner,

3359
02:23:42.265 --> 02:23:43.991
but it's only about 15 feet up.

3360
02:23:43.991 --> 02:23:45.930
If you were-- and you can climb up the side.

3361
02:23:45.930 --> 02:23:48.221
If you want to roll an athletics check to try,

3362
02:23:48.221 --> 02:23:49.054
and I'll let you get up there

3363
02:23:49.054 --> 02:23:49.887
where you can still strike her.

3364
02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:52.770
Because you are hasted, you're scurrying up.

3365
02:23:52.770 --> 02:23:54.860
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Make an athletics check

3366
02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:57.018
for me, or acrobatics, either/or.

3367
02:23:57.018 --> 02:23:58.210
MARISHA: Natural 20.

3368
02:23:58.210 --> 02:23:59.043
MATT: You're fine.

3369
02:23:59.043 --> 02:24:00.835
You dart up and you get right into her face.

3370
02:24:00.835 --> 02:24:02.143
MARISHA: Man, that feels like it would've been

3371
02:24:02.143 --> 02:24:03.390
useful somewhere else.

3372
02:24:03.390 --> 02:24:05.890
MATT: You are up in the succubus' face.

3373
02:24:05.890 --> 02:24:09.180
MARISHA: I'm going to grab her by her hair

3374
02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:11.440
and bash her into the wall.

3375
02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:12.913
MATT: All right, roll for the attack.

3376
02:24:12.913 --> 02:24:14.313
MARISHA: With my magical fists.

3377
02:24:14.313 --> 02:24:16.355
SAM: Stomp that ho-regard!

3378
02:24:16.355 --> 02:24:18.940
(laughter)

3379
02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:21.970
TRAVIS: Your shitty, shitty pun affected that dice roll.

3380
02:24:21.970 --> 02:24:23.460
MARISHA: I agree, 13.

3381
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:26.990
MATT: 13 does not hit, unfortunately.

3382
02:24:27.833 --> 02:24:29.050
TRAVIS: That was you.
MARISHA: Boof! Do it again!

3383
02:24:29.050 --> 02:24:31.711
MATT: She's blocking against the stone work.

3384
02:24:31.711 --> 02:24:34.207
MARISHA: Green Leaf goldfish.

3385
02:24:34.207 --> 02:24:35.940
Better, but 16?

3386
02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:37.402
MATT: 16 just hits.

3387
02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:39.273
LIAM: Oh god!

3388
02:24:40.381 --> 02:24:42.220
Holy shit.

3389
02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:45.893
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, nine damage.

3390
02:24:46.830 --> 02:24:49.600
Stunning Strike.

3391
02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:50.690
Please.

3392
02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:53.070
Please have a low constitution, bitch.

3393
02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:59.300
MATT: That is going to be, constitution, total?

3394
02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:01.533
18.

3395
02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:03.760
Natural 17 plus one.

3396
02:25:05.001 --> 02:25:06.350
You have your bonus action still.

3397
02:25:06.350 --> 02:25:08.070
MARISHA: Well, I have one more hasted action.

3398
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:10.630
I'm going to attack again.
MATT: Go for it.

3399
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:12.380
Second attack, or third attack now.

3400
02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:16.130
MARISHA: No.

3401
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:18.307
Definitely not. Rolled a three.

3402
02:25:18.307 --> 02:25:19.140
MATT: Yeah.

3403
02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:22.280
She's resisting the strikes as you're trying to slam her

3404
02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:23.660
into the stone wall.

3405
02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:24.810
The bonus action still.

3406
02:25:27.450 --> 02:25:31.790
MARISHA: What am I fucking going to do?

3407
02:25:31.790 --> 02:25:34.216
Try and kill--was this worth it?

3408
02:25:34.216 --> 02:25:35.820
(yelling)

3409
02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:38.099
I'm going to--

3410
02:25:38.099 --> 02:25:39.057
LIAM: D&amp;D.

3411
02:25:39.057 --> 02:25:40.310
MATT: They haven't healed up fully.

3412
02:25:40.310 --> 02:25:41.750
They haven't healed since the previous battles.

3413
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:43.460
They're still wounded from when you guys fought.

3414
02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:45.435
MARISHA: They're still wounded?

3415
02:25:45.435 --> 02:25:47.270
TRAVIS:a They've got some scratches on 'em.

3416
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:49.370
We haven't done shit to them.

3417
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:50.780
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

3418
02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:51.613
SAM: Yeah.

3419
02:25:52.464 --> 02:25:54.260
TRAVIS:a I mean, you know we don't,

3420
02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:56.910
but I feel like we haven't hit them that much.

3421
02:25:56.910 --> 02:25:58.370
Then there's Toro over there.

3422
02:25:58.370 --> 02:25:59.920
MARISHA: Two more, two more, two more.

3423
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:02.290
Okay, I think both of those hit.

3424
02:26:02.290 --> 02:26:04.470
I rolled 16 and a 12.

3425
02:26:04.470 --> 02:26:05.620
MATT: Oh, you rolled 16 plus 12?

3426
02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:06.453
MARISHA: Plus eight.

3427
02:26:06.453 --> 02:26:08.136
MATT: Yeah, yeah, they both hit.

3428
02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:14.540
MARISHA: Nine plus another seven damage.

3429
02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:17.340
MATT: All right so, repeatedly slamming the succubus

3430
02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:19.451
into the side of the stone wall.

3431
02:26:20.318 --> 02:26:21.200
Okay.

3432
02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:22.033
Yeah.

3433
02:26:22.033 --> 02:26:23.362
It's hurting her.

3434
02:26:23.362 --> 02:26:24.970
She's like (grunting) and is trying to resist.

3435
02:26:24.970 --> 02:26:26.332
It's hurting her.

3436
02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:29.510
MARISHA: It's hurting her, okay.

3437
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:30.770
MATT: She's getting perpetually more wounded.

3438
02:26:30.770 --> 02:26:32.307
Anything else you want to do?

3439
02:26:32.307 --> 02:26:33.140
Is that your turn?

3440
02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:34.063
LAURA: Yeah, that's my turn.

3441
02:26:34.063 --> 02:26:36.217
MATT: Ends Beauregard's turn. That brings us to Fjord.

3442
02:26:36.217 --> 02:26:38.057
You're up.

3443
02:26:38.057 --> 02:26:41.731
This thing is (stomping, electricity crackling)

3444
02:26:41.731 --> 02:26:42.935
LAURA: Is he as hot

3445
02:26:42.935 --> 02:26:44.160
as the succubus, though?

3446
02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:48.598
MATT: Oh, no. Apparently you guys sexualize all my NPCs.

3447
02:26:48.598 --> 02:26:50.964
TRAVIS: Is he emanating heat?

3448
02:26:50.964 --> 02:26:51.940
MATT: No.

3449
02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:56.580
It is not emanating heat. It is not, I mean,

3450
02:26:56.580 --> 02:26:59.817
you've dabbled in arcane power, in somewhat

3451
02:26:59.817 --> 02:27:04.810
darker powers, but your essence is not fiendish

3452
02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:07.825
in your pact, so you don't understand too much about it.

3453
02:27:07.825 --> 02:27:09.675
TRAVIS: Would this be a monster?

3454
02:27:09.675 --> 02:27:13.030
MATT: It's a monster, yeah!

3455
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:14.420
TRAVIS: I don't know how the spell works.

3456
02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:17.688
But if I do it, I'll fucking fail. I got to get out of here.

3457
02:27:17.688 --> 02:27:18.521
LAURA: Try it.

3458
02:27:18.521 --> 02:27:22.879
TRAVIS: No, I can't. If it fails, I'm dead.

3459
02:27:22.879 --> 02:27:24.551
SAM: If it fails, you're dead?

3460
02:27:24.551 --> 02:27:26.890
TRAVIS: Yeah, if I miss then-- fuck it.

3461
02:27:26.890 --> 02:27:29.190
I'll take the falchion and I'll shove it into the ground

3462
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:30.770
and I'll cast Thunder Step.

3463
02:27:30.770 --> 02:27:32.102
MATT: Thunder Step, okay.

3464
02:27:32.102 --> 02:27:33.510
TALIESIN: Good call, good call.

3465
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:38.212
TRAVIS: I will go 90.

3466
02:27:38.212 --> 02:27:39.904
I think it's 90 feet.

3467
02:27:39.904 --> 02:27:42.071
(humming)

3468
02:27:43.219 --> 02:27:45.160
LIAM: It's like, you've done that before.

3469
02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:48.840
TRAVIS: Yeah, 90 feet towards the entrance of the-- yeah.

3470
02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:51.016
MATT: You can just go all the way back here if you want to.

3471
02:27:51.016 --> 02:27:52.563
TRAVIS: I'm getting the fuck out.

3472
02:27:52.563 --> 02:27:55.227
MATT: Right next to the unconscious, sleeping

3473
02:27:55.227 --> 02:27:58.648
body of Nugget. Roll damage.

3474
02:27:58.648 --> 02:28:01.973
SAM: Fjord abandons Jester at least once a fight.

3475
02:28:01.973 --> 02:28:03.964
LIAM: And dead is your favored terrain.

3476
02:28:03.964 --> 02:28:06.614
TRAVIS: 22 points of thunder damage.

3477
02:28:06.614 --> 02:28:08.389
MATT: What's the save on it?

3478
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:11.290
TRAVIS: Constitution 16.

3479
02:28:11.290 --> 02:28:15.917
MATT: Constitution, 15. It fails by one.

3480
02:28:15.917 --> 02:28:19.467
Ten plus five. How much damage was that? It was 22.

3481
02:28:19.467 --> 02:28:20.583
TRAVIS: 22.

3482
02:28:20.583 --> 02:28:23.090
MATT: Did he have to roll twice on that one, too?

3483
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:24.677
MATT: Good call. Thank you for the reminder.

3484
02:28:24.677 --> 02:28:25.510
LAURA: Sorry.

3485
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:27.889
MATT: I rolled lower. You're fine. Still takes

3486
02:28:27.889 --> 02:28:29.495
the full 22 points of thunder damage.

3487
02:28:29.495 --> 02:28:31.910
It actually gets shoved back and slams into

3488
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:33.860
one of the nearby rocks. One of the stalagmites

3489
02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:35.969
snaps and breaks off. You hear this loud crack sound

3490
02:28:35.969 --> 02:28:40.410
that echoes through the rounding hallway.

3491
02:28:40.410 --> 02:28:41.243
That finishes your turn?

3492
02:28:41.243 --> 02:28:42.076
TRAVIS: It does.

3493
02:28:42.076 --> 02:28:45.520
MATT: All righty. So.

3494
02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:48.150
Don't forget your Hexblade's Curse, by the way.

3495
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:49.684
You have that ability still.

3496
02:28:49.684 --> 02:28:51.670
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'd be if I was fighting something.

3497
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:53.625
MATT: True enough, Yasha's go.

3498
02:28:53.625 --> 02:28:57.613
TRAVIS: Oh, god. Um. (thinking noises)

3499
02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:04.832
Boy.

3500
02:29:04.832 --> 02:29:07.777
MARISHA: (singing "Mahna Mahna")

3501
02:29:07.777 --> 02:29:09.219
TRAVIS: Are we fighting these?

3502
02:29:09.219 --> 02:29:11.620
SAM: We have to! What are we going to do, run?

3503
02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:13.400
They're going to chase us down and kill us on the way out.

3504
02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:16.123
TRAVIS: We could close the tunnel.

3505
02:29:16.123 --> 02:29:17.297
SAM: We're fighting these things.

3506
02:29:17.297 --> 02:29:19.700
MARISHA: Is anybody able to do anything like that?

3507
02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:20.862
LIAM: Do what you're going to do.

3508
02:29:20.862 --> 02:29:21.695
MATT: What's Yasha doing?

3509
02:29:21.695 --> 02:29:24.512
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha will run up, that's fine.

3510
02:29:24.512 --> 02:29:26.191
SAM: Half-hearted attack.

3511
02:29:26.191 --> 02:29:28.838
TRAVIS: Just love playing somebody else's character.

3512
02:29:28.838 --> 02:29:31.904
MATT: The incubus has been holding its action.

3513
02:29:31.904 --> 02:29:34.987
Steps up and Yasha feels

3514
02:29:34.987 --> 02:29:37.520
the intrusion of this telepathic bond.

3515
02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:40.152
Make a wisdom saving throw for Yasha, please.

3516
02:29:40.152 --> 02:29:44.879
TALIESIN and MATT: With advantage.

3517
02:29:44.879 --> 02:29:46.564
TRAVIS: Is that a negative one to the wisdom save?

3518
02:29:46.564 --> 02:29:49.677
LAURA: Oh no, Yasha.

3519
02:29:52.050 --> 02:29:54.987
MATT: Yasha stops in her tracks.

3520
02:29:54.987 --> 02:29:56.500
TRAVIS: Should have run away.

3521
02:29:56.500 --> 02:30:01.480
MATT: Stops in her tracks and turns

3522
02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:03.830
and for the rest of the turn,

3523
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:08.830
using the willpower of

3524
02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:12.779
the guiding voice of this incubus,

3525
02:30:12.779 --> 02:30:17.768
is going to dash around the corner this way.

3526
02:30:19.380 --> 02:30:22.220
About there. She's can't get full through its space.

3527
02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:25.070
Now is, with the Magician's Judge

3528
02:30:25.070 --> 02:30:30.070
joining the ranks of the large monster staring down Jester.

3529
02:30:30.078 --> 02:30:31.469
LAURA: Why me?

3530
02:30:31.469 --> 02:30:32.660
MATT: Because you're the one it can see.

3531
02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:33.947
LAURA: Beau is right there!

3532
02:30:33.947 --> 02:30:35.610
MATT: Beau is right there. You're right.

3533
02:30:35.610 --> 02:30:37.351
LAURA: I'm kidding, Beau, no, come after me!

3534
02:30:37.351 --> 02:30:38.259
MATT: After Beau.

3535
02:30:38.259 --> 02:30:40.617
LIAM: Come at me, bro.

3536
02:30:40.617 --> 02:30:43.660
MATT: Beau, while you're slamming the succubus

3537
02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:46.440
into the wall--

3538
02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:48.976
MATT: There's value in running, people.

3539
02:30:48.976 --> 02:30:51.401
MATT: You hear this (thudding).

3540
02:30:51.401 --> 02:30:52.993
LAURA: I'm sorry, Beau, I didn't mean, I just--

3541
02:30:52.993 --> 02:30:54.968
MATT: You look behind and Yasha's

3542
02:30:54.968 --> 02:30:58.633
running up to give you help. She's coming to the rescue.

3543
02:30:58.633 --> 02:31:00.311
MARISHA: Oh, Yasha, good.

3544
02:31:00.311 --> 02:31:03.911
MATT: Nott, your turn.

3545
02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:09.835
You are invisible. Nothing seems to know you're there.

3546
02:31:16.143 --> 02:31:18.940
SAM: Beau is engaged with the one up on the wall.

3547
02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:21.540
MATT: Currently, yes.

3548
02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:24.625
SAM: All right, I guess I'll help that one.

3549
02:31:24.625 --> 02:31:29.210
Did I see Yasha go get charmed or anything?

3550
02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:31.220
MATT: All you saw was Yasha rush up, stop for a second,

3551
02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:33.325
and then rush towards Beauregard.

3552
02:31:33.325 --> 02:31:35.840
You can try to make an insight check.

3553
02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.600
SAM: That would be my action?

3554
02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:39.233
MATT: I'll let you take one now--

3555
02:31:39.233 --> 02:31:40.152
SAM: Free action!

3556
02:31:40.152 --> 02:31:41.135
MATT: Since you are right there.

3557
02:31:41.135 --> 02:31:41.968
SAM: Ten.

3558
02:31:41.968 --> 02:31:43.418
MATT: Ten, no. You have no idea.

3559
02:31:43.418 --> 02:31:44.251
SAM: 13.

3560
02:31:44.251 --> 02:31:45.709
MATT: No idea.

3561
02:31:45.709 --> 02:31:49.790
SAM: I will attack the one that Beau is engaged with.

3562
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:51.490
MATT: All righty, no worries.

3563
02:31:51.490 --> 02:31:53.571
You do reveal yourself and the Invisibility spell.

3564
02:31:53.571 --> 02:31:56.537
SAM: That's fine. 22 to hit.

3565
02:31:56.537 --> 02:31:58.870
MATT: That definitely hits.

3566
02:31:58.870 --> 02:32:00.161
SAM: Sneak attack.

3567
02:32:00.161 --> 02:32:01.769
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3568
02:32:02.668 --> 02:32:07.276
SAM: Okay, (counting) 17 plus six.

3569
02:32:07.276 --> 02:32:10.560
23 plus another eight

3570
02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:13.170
for Fury of the Small!

3571
02:32:13.170 --> 02:32:15.795
MATT: Okay, so 31.

3572
02:32:15.795 --> 02:32:17.136
SAM: 31 points of damage.

3573
02:32:17.136 --> 02:32:19.659
MATT: It is a magical weapon, correct, the--

3574
02:32:19.659 --> 02:32:21.697
SAM: The Tinkertop Boltblaster is definitely a magic weapon.

3575
02:32:21.697 --> 02:32:24.360
MATT: How do you want to do this?

3576
02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:26.566
SAM: Oh, they're not so strong!

3577
02:32:26.566 --> 02:32:28.335
LIAM: (yelling like Nott)

3578
02:32:28.335 --> 02:32:29.168
MARISHA: Fuck yes.

3579
02:32:29.168 --> 02:32:30.643
SAM: Wow.

3580
02:32:30.643 --> 02:32:31.570
Wow.

3581
02:32:31.570 --> 02:32:34.770
Is she flying or climbed up there?

3582
02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:38.000
MATT: She is currently being held by the face by Beau

3583
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.920
and being slammed into the stone wall repeatedly.

3584
02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:45.404
SAM: Okay, if there's a way to,

3585
02:32:45.404 --> 02:32:47.388
I don't know,

3586
02:32:47.388 --> 02:32:52.388
go right through Beau's finger, like right there.

3587
02:32:52.443 --> 02:32:54.530
MATT: As the creature is fighting you off,

3588
02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:57.980
all of a sudden, there's no resistance,

3589
02:32:57.980 --> 02:33:00.460
and you (slamming). You look down, and there's about

3590
02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.180
three inches of a bolt emerging from between

3591
02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:04.912
your index and middle finger. Where one of the eyes

3592
02:33:04.912 --> 02:33:07.757
of the succubus was, and you look, and there's just

3593
02:33:07.757 --> 02:33:11.000
this thick blood now pouring in the palm of your hand.

3594
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.337
MARISHA: I go: Huh. Keep the dart.

3595
02:33:13.337 --> 02:33:16.603
MATT: There you go. Waste not want not.

3596
02:33:16.603 --> 02:33:18.223
LIAM: Catch me outside, how 'bout that?

3597
02:33:18.223 --> 02:33:20.310
MATT: As you're holding onto the stalagmite

3598
02:33:20.310 --> 02:33:21.970
after doing this, you drop it and look behind,

3599
02:33:21.970 --> 02:33:24.630
you see Nott behind smiling and Yasha's right there

3600
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:26.650
with the Magician's Judge, ready to help out.

3601
02:33:26.650 --> 02:33:27.880
SAM: Yeah, we're all doing it.

3602
02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:31.023
The three ladies are kicking ass over here.

3603
02:33:31.023 --> 02:33:33.180
MATT: That's one attack, action.

3604
02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:36.047
SAM: Okay, I guess I'll bonus action.

3605
02:33:36.047 --> 02:33:38.740
MATT: Well, no, because you don't have disadvantage.

3606
02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:39.906
You don't have the range thing because you're

3607
02:33:39.906 --> 02:33:41.789
Crossbow Expert. You're fine.

3608
02:33:41.789 --> 02:33:42.622
SAM: Crossbow expert.

3609
02:33:42.622 --> 02:33:46.164
No, I mean, I only have 30-foot range on this thing.

3610
02:33:46.164 --> 02:33:47.400
MATT: 30-foot, so you would have probably had to move in

3611
02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:48.233
a little closer.

3612
02:33:48.233 --> 02:33:49.066
SAM: Okay, that's fine.

3613
02:33:49.066 --> 02:33:51.181
MATT: I figured you would have. There you go.

3614
02:33:51.181 --> 02:33:52.890
SAM: Then I'll take my second shot at the other one.

3615
02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:53.770
That I can see.

3616
02:33:53.770 --> 02:33:55.554
I have a bonus action to attack.

3617
02:33:55.554 --> 02:33:56.950
MATT: One step closer if you want to stay within that range.

3618
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:57.783
SAM: That's fine.

3619
02:33:57.783 --> 02:34:00.070
MATT: Okay. It does have half cover because it's amongst

3620
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:02.260
those stalagmites, so it does get a bonus to its AC,

3621
02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:03.210
but go ahead and roll.

3622
02:34:03.210 --> 02:34:04.410
SAM: Okay.

3623
02:34:04.410 --> 02:34:06.120
MATT: It's plus two to its AC.

3624
02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:07.620
SAM: That's a lot, 25.

3625
02:34:07.620 --> 02:34:08.453
MATT: Still hits.

3626
02:34:08.453 --> 02:34:09.286
SAM: Yes!

3627
02:34:09.286 --> 02:34:11.280
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

3628
02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.869
SAM: Ten points of damage.

3629
02:34:13.869 --> 02:34:15.893
MATT: All righty.

3630
02:34:15.893 --> 02:34:17.860
Nice.

3631
02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:19.120
So.

3632
02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:21.240
It takes the bolt to the side

3633
02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:23.860
of its-- just to the right of its sternum and below,

3634
02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:26.114
and it sinks about three inches in, grabs it.

3635
02:34:26.114 --> 02:34:30.070
Looks over towards the boss in the back corner.

3636
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:32.784
You can see it's preparing itself to move. That finishes--?

3637
02:34:32.784 --> 02:34:33.757
SAM: If I have any movement left,

3638
02:34:33.757 --> 02:34:35.415
I'll back up to where I was.

3639
02:34:35.415 --> 02:34:36.953
MATT: You have 20, 25 feet.

3640
02:34:36.953 --> 02:34:39.578
SAM: I'm going back as far as I can behind some stalags.

3641
02:34:39.578 --> 02:34:40.627
MATT: That's where you want to go?

3642
02:34:40.627 --> 02:34:41.469
SAM: Uh-huh.

3643
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:42.910
MATT: That finishes your turn, Nott.

3644
02:34:42.910 --> 02:34:46.100
That brings us to the top of the round. Jester, you are up.

3645
02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:47.233
LAURA: Okay.

3646
02:34:47.233 --> 02:34:49.400
MATT: Fjord just bamfs out of it,

3647
02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:50.870
and now you're the only creature,

3648
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:53.050
the only thing this creature sees.

3649
02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:54.510
TRAVIS: I would have come for you, but if I ran,

3650
02:34:54.510 --> 02:34:55.870
he'd get an attack and I'd be dead.

3651
02:34:55.870 --> 02:35:00.560
LAURA: I take a couple breaths, I step around the corner.

3652
02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:01.409
I'm going to--

3653
02:35:01.409 --> 02:35:02.242
MATT: This corner?

3654
02:35:02.242 --> 02:35:05.592
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to turn around so I can see straight.

3655
02:35:05.592 --> 02:35:06.540
MATT: Right there?

3656
02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:09.840
LAURA: I'm going to look like I'm about to aim for him.

3657
02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:11.995
I'm going to change my aim at the last second

3658
02:35:11.995 --> 02:35:14.200
and aim straight at the slit in the wall

3659
02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:16.231
and cast Dispel Magic.

3660
02:35:16.231 --> 02:35:17.656
MATT: Oh, against...?

3661
02:35:17.656 --> 02:35:19.114
LAURA: The big hole in the wall.

3662
02:35:19.114 --> 02:35:20.548
MATT: The big hole in the wall, over there?

3663
02:35:20.548 --> 02:35:22.308
LAURA: To trap them in here with us, yeah.

3664
02:35:22.308 --> 02:35:24.142
MATT: What's the range on that?

3665
02:35:24.142 --> 02:35:25.399
LAURA: 120 feet.

3666
02:35:25.399 --> 02:35:28.070
MATT: Oh yeah, roll a wisdom check for me,

3667
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:29.137
if you don't mind.

3668
02:35:29.137 --> 02:35:30.698
SAM: Punish that slit.

3669
02:35:30.698 --> 02:35:32.056
No?

3670
02:35:32.056 --> 02:35:35.130
MATT: No, no, no.

3671
02:35:35.130 --> 02:35:38.310
LAURA: 19. Oh wait, that's a saving throw, sorry.

3672
02:35:38.310 --> 02:35:39.618
MATT: That's all right. Bonus is?

3673
02:35:39.618 --> 02:35:42.310
LAURA: 16.

3674
02:35:42.310 --> 02:35:45.637
TRAVIS: Closed the door. The door is closed.

3675
02:35:45.637 --> 02:35:48.786
MATT: The rift collapses.

3676
02:35:48.786 --> 02:35:52.313
You notice, Beau, as you're up on the side,

3677
02:35:52.313 --> 02:35:55.730
on the opposite end of this, you can hear other calls.

3678
02:35:55.730 --> 02:35:57.290
(grunting)

3679
02:35:57.290 --> 02:36:00.480
Other things were approaching the rift

3680
02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:02.880
from the opposite side to join the battle

3681
02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:06.746
before it closes

3682
02:36:06.746 --> 02:36:08.887
and no longer exists.

3683
02:36:08.887 --> 02:36:10.080
LAURA: I'm going to look at the pit fiend,

3684
02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:11.580
or whatever the fuck it is.

3685
02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:13.980
MATT: It looks back.

3686
02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:16.475
(angry yelling)

3687
02:36:16.475 --> 02:36:19.529
LAURA: Now you're trapped in here with us!

3688
02:36:19.529 --> 02:36:22.012
I'm going to turn around and run away.

3689
02:36:22.012 --> 02:36:25.296
(applause)

3690
02:36:25.296 --> 02:36:27.186
LAURA: (screaming)

3691
02:36:27.186 --> 02:36:29.800
SAM: Nice, nice, nice.

3692
02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:31.820
LAURA: Then for my bonus action, no, that's it.

3693
02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:33.540
MATT: That finishes your turn, Jester.

3694
02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:35.260
Now it's the incubus' turn.

3695
02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:37.990
The incubus gives a cursory glance

3696
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:41.090
over towards Yasha. Doesn't worry too much.

3697
02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:45.240
It's going to fly.

3698
02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:49.113
As an action, it's going to turn ethereal.

3699
02:36:49.113 --> 02:36:51.240
It's going to fly up towards this area,

3700
02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:54.800
and now currently its physical form

3701
02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:57.470
turning into that spectral form that it was

3702
02:36:57.470 --> 02:37:00.140
when you previously encountered it.

3703
02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:01.620
All righty.

3704
02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:06.615
Finishing that, it is now the larger entity's turn.

3705
02:37:08.510 --> 02:37:11.292
LAURA: No, no, no, no!

3706
02:37:11.292 --> 02:37:13.400
SAM: Can't even get to you.

3707
02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:15.267
LAURA: It can still get to me, though.

3708
02:37:15.267 --> 02:37:18.720
TALIESIN: You're going to be all right.

3709
02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:22.800
MATT: It sees you partially behind the pillar

3710
02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:26.577
on the opposite end.

3711
02:37:26.577 --> 02:37:28.070
As it brings its claws up to strike you,

3712
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:30.130
it glances over and sees a little bit

3713
02:37:30.130 --> 02:37:33.710
of Caduceus' pink hair poking through and goes--

3714
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:35.860
Reaches back and in the middle of its claws,

3715
02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:39.235
where the energy is gathering, it pulls back.

3716
02:37:39.235 --> 02:37:42.630
This javelin of lighting energy appears.

3717
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:45.470
It pulls its claw backward, grasps it,

3718
02:37:45.470 --> 02:37:48.840
and then launches it forward in a line,

3719
02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:51.010
striking towards both Jester and Caduceus.

3720
02:37:51.010 --> 02:37:56.010
I need you both to make a dexterity saving throw, please.

3721
02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:59.150
LAURA: Ambidextrous.

3722
02:37:59.150 --> 02:38:01.920
LAURA: Oh, 20.
TALIESIN: 17.

3723
02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:04.690
MATT: Both of those succeed. You take half damage.

3724
02:38:04.690 --> 02:38:09.440
You both take 14 points of lightning damage.

3725
02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:13.970
The spear tears through, striking and splintering

3726
02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:16.380
the top of the stalagmite that you've been hiding

3727
02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:20.800
partially behind. Nevertheless, you both manage

3728
02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.690
to avoid the brunt of it.

3729
02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:24.569
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hellish Rebuke.

3730
02:38:24.569 --> 02:38:26.311
(yelling)

3731
02:38:26.311 --> 02:38:28.590
MATT: Go for it. Is that a constitution or a dexterity save?

3732
02:38:28.590 --> 02:38:29.606
LAURA: That's a dexterity save.

3733
02:38:29.606 --> 02:38:33.689
MATT: I keep forgetting. All right, dex, all right.

3734
02:38:33.689 --> 02:38:35.830
That is going to be a 16.

3735
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:37.990
LAURA: 12 is all you had to beat, so yeah.

3736
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:39.330
But you get half damage.

3737
02:38:39.330 --> 02:38:40.680
MATT: Which is still?

3738
02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:41.920
LAURA: Still at like resistance.

3739
02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:45.637
17, 19 points of cold damage.

3740
02:38:45.637 --> 02:38:47.860
MATT: Reduced to nine.

3741
02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:50.510
Then since it's resistant, it takes four.

3742
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:52.276
LAURA: Yay.

3743
02:38:52.276 --> 02:38:54.764
MATT: But that's damage. It's all damage. It all adds up.

3744
02:38:54.764 --> 02:38:56.239
SAM and LAURA: How do you want to do this!

3745
02:38:56.239 --> 02:38:58.021
LAURA: I did it, you guys!

3746
02:38:58.021 --> 02:39:00.570
MATT: As you turn out angrily, the shards of ice

3747
02:39:00.570 --> 02:39:03.480
that emerge from your burst of violent emotional

3748
02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:08.480
retribution strike into its body. It flexes.

3749
02:39:08.850 --> 02:39:12.140
TALIESIN: Do I have to make a concentration check?

3750
02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:13.290
MATT: You do.

3751
02:39:13.290 --> 02:39:15.940
It flexes its demonic body and

3752
02:39:15.940 --> 02:39:18.118
the ice shards dissipate off its chest.

3753
02:39:18.118 --> 02:39:19.797
TALIESIN: What's the concentration check?

3754
02:39:19.797 --> 02:39:23.020
MATT: It's half damage or DC10, whichever's higher.

3755
02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:24.200
Just roll a constitution save.

3756
02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:25.616
TALIESIN: Seven.

3757
02:39:25.616 --> 02:39:27.942
MATT: Seven, it's gone, unfortunately.

3758
02:39:27.942 --> 02:39:29.144
Did you take the War Caster feat?

3759
02:39:29.144 --> 02:39:29.977
TALIESINL I did.

3760
02:39:29.977 --> 02:39:33.400
MATT: It's with advantage. Oh, buddy, I'm so sorry.

3761
02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:35.010
TALIESIN: I rolled a seven and a five.

3762
02:39:35.010 --> 02:39:36.740
MATT: With your constitution saving throw?

3763
02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:38.729
TALIESIN: Oh, plus con, ten.

3764
02:39:38.729 --> 02:39:40.054
MATT: Oh, ten succeeds.

3765
02:39:40.054 --> 02:39:41.453
TALIESIN: Nevermind, still good.

3766
02:39:41.453 --> 02:39:42.990
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw,

3767
02:39:42.990 --> 02:39:44.610
so you always add your constitution save.

3768
02:39:44.610 --> 02:39:46.610
Ten is the baseline you needed to make.

3769
02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:50.109
Beacon of Hope is still up.

3770
02:39:50.109 --> 02:39:51.258
TALIESIN: Be cool, be cool.

3771
02:39:51.258 --> 02:39:54.341
MATT: Good on you. That finishes its turn. Caleb, you're up.

3772
02:39:54.341 --> 02:39:55.870
It's just coming around the corner now.

3773
02:39:55.870 --> 02:39:58.170
You watch this bolt of energy streak past,

3774
02:39:58.170 --> 02:40:00.370
maybe a foot from you, slamming through Jester.

3775
02:40:00.370 --> 02:40:02.530
She dodges out of the way, slamming into Caduceus

3776
02:40:02.530 --> 02:40:05.710
as he manages to duck behind the stalagmite,

3777
02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:09.500
and you hear the (thudding) getting louder and louder.

3778
02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:13.523
LIAM: I pull the glove of blasting and fire off three--

3779
02:40:13.523 --> 02:40:17.682
oh my god-- bolts of fire.

3780
02:40:17.682 --> 02:40:19.223
I'm casting at--

3781
02:40:19.223 --> 02:40:22.270
MATT: It will get half cover. I recommend moving into--

3782
02:40:22.270 --> 02:40:26.350
LIAM: I will bob out to the side, so I see him.

3783
02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:29.060
Where the hell is this spell,

3784
02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:32.520
I haven't used it in so long.

3785
02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:33.800
Did I lose it? <i>Shite.</i>

3786
02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:37.145
It's three attacks.

3787
02:40:37.145 --> 02:40:39.348
The first one misses.

3788
02:40:39.348 --> 02:40:42.718
Second one is an 18.

3789
02:40:42.718 --> 02:40:43.885
MATT: 18 hits.

3790
02:40:43.885 --> 02:40:46.290
LIAM: The third one is cocked.

3791
02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:48.976
LIAM: That was an 18, do you want to call it an 18 as well?

3792
02:40:48.976 --> 02:40:50.593
MATT: That was barely cocked, it would have stayed.

3793
02:40:50.593 --> 02:40:51.426
LIAM: I rolled an 18.

3794
02:40:51.426 --> 02:40:52.342
MATT: Oh, you did? Okay, yeah.

3795
02:40:52.342 --> 02:40:56.750
LIAM: The second two. It's 2d6 per, so.

3796
02:40:56.750 --> 02:41:00.316
Four. Eight, so he will take half of that.

3797
02:41:00.316 --> 02:41:01.149
MATT: Eight points of fire damage?

3798
02:41:01.149 --> 02:41:01.982
LIAM: Yeah.

3799
02:41:01.982 --> 02:41:03.207
MATT: Yeah, so reduced to half because

3800
02:41:03.207 --> 02:41:05.073
it's resistant to the arcane flames.

3801
02:41:05.073 --> 02:41:08.960
Takes another four points of damage.

3802
02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:12.300
LIAM: I will shout: What in the Nine Hells are we doing?

3803
02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:16.880
I will go into the hallway into that pocket there, yeah.

3804
02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:19.371
SAM: Stepping over the dead dog to get there.

3805
02:41:19.371 --> 02:41:20.813
LAURA: He's not dead, he's sleeping!

3806
02:41:20.813 --> 02:41:22.279
MATT: He's over there. He's fine.

3807
02:41:22.279 --> 02:41:23.460
Fjord's got to worry about that.

3808
02:41:23.460 --> 02:41:25.760
That finishes your go, Caleb, Caduceus, you're up.

3809
02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:28.770
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

3810
02:41:28.770 --> 02:41:31.686
Okay. I don't have a lot of useful things I can do,

3811
02:41:31.686 --> 02:41:36.310
so I am going to-- how many feet away

3812
02:41:36.310 --> 02:41:38.700
from this creature am I?

3813
02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:41.300
MATT: You guesstimate around 30 to 40 feet.

3814
02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:45.402
You're not quite sure. You're in that in-between space.

3815
02:41:45.402 --> 02:41:49.268
TALIESIN: Oh. I can't really do what I want to do right now,

3816
02:41:49.268 --> 02:41:52.893
so I will--

3817
02:41:52.893 --> 02:41:55.803
MATT: Beau, you're on deck.

3818
02:41:55.803 --> 02:41:59.100
TALIESIN: I'm going to, for the moment, attempt

3819
02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:01.520
a Sacred Flame, fuck it.

3820
02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:02.700
MATT: Sacred Flame, go for it.

3821
02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:03.533
TALIESIN: It's a dex save.

3822
02:42:03.533 --> 02:42:07.891
MATT: Dex save. That is a fail, I believe.

3823
02:42:07.891 --> 02:42:09.307
It's a 12.

3824
02:42:09.307 --> 02:42:10.882
TALIESIN: That is a fail.

3825
02:42:10.882 --> 02:42:11.975
LAURA: Is that radiant damage?

3826
02:42:11.975 --> 02:42:15.090
TALIESIN: That is radiant damage.

3827
02:42:15.090 --> 02:42:19.924
Just have to find my dice, here we are.

3828
02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:24.171
That's 11 points of radiant damage.

3829
02:42:24.171 --> 02:42:26.040
MATT: 11 points of radiant damage, all righty.

3830
02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:28.910
Flames burst across his chest, like (grunting).

3831
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:31.580
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to get a little bit.

3832
02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:33.438
I'm going to move a little.

3833
02:42:33.438 --> 02:42:34.870
Yeah, I'm going to get out of line.

3834
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:36.560
Yeah, like right over there, so that I'm--

3835
02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:37.393
MATT: 25, 30's as far--

3836
02:42:37.393 --> 02:42:39.213
TALIESIN: Yeah, not quite that far back.

3837
02:42:39.213 --> 02:42:41.250
I'm actually a little closer even.

3838
02:42:41.250 --> 02:42:42.083
MATT: Little closer there?

3839
02:42:42.083 --> 02:42:45.224
TALIESIN: A little closer.

3840
02:42:45.224 --> 02:42:46.790
Hovering there, so there's a little cover

3841
02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:47.623
from those stalactites.

3842
02:42:47.623 --> 02:42:49.465
MATT: You got it. That finishes your go.

3843
02:42:49.465 --> 02:42:52.355
Beauregard, you're up.

3844
02:42:52.355 --> 02:42:54.447
You look and you see Yasha there, and you're like,

3845
02:42:54.447 --> 02:42:57.905
"All right, cool." You see it like lumbering around the way.

3846
02:42:57.905 --> 02:43:01.810
MARISHA: Incubus is a sexy blue specter.

3847
02:43:01.810 --> 02:43:04.028
MATT: Correct.

3848
02:43:04.028 --> 02:43:09.025
MARISHA: I'm going to bolt with my 90 feet of movement to

3849
02:43:10.330 --> 02:43:13.180
bull horns. Mess with bull, get the horns.

3850
02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:15.600
MATT: You dart around, get about there.

3851
02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:18.770
As you move beyond Yasha, take an attack of opportunity,

3852
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:21.767
a Sentinel attack. Go ahead and roll.

3853
02:43:21.767 --> 02:43:22.979
LIAM: 22 AC.

3854
02:43:22.979 --> 02:43:24.737
TRAVIS: I forgot she was charmed.

3855
02:43:24.737 --> 02:43:28.710
MATT: Yeah, roll an attack.

3856
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:30.235
TRAVIS: Hey, that's a two!

3857
02:43:30.235 --> 02:43:31.925
LIAM and SAM: Ooh!

3858
02:43:31.925 --> 02:43:33.540
MATT: Are you okay?

3859
02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:35.257
TALIESIN: He's not going anywhere.

3860
02:43:35.257 --> 02:43:38.998
LIAM: Shield. I'm fine.

3861
02:43:38.998 --> 02:43:40.580
You know, for four years we've all been like,

3862
02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:42.662
"What did he roll?"

3863
02:43:42.662 --> 02:43:45.400
TRAVIS: For a total of eight.

3864
02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:46.880
MATT: A total of eight?

3865
02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:49.564
TRAVIS: Two plus six.

3866
02:43:49.564 --> 02:43:50.438
MATT: All right, that's a fail.

3867
02:43:50.438 --> 02:43:51.463
LIAM: Do we need to talk about something?

3868
02:43:51.463 --> 02:43:54.220
MARISHA: Instantly gif-ed.

3869
02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:57.050
MATT: Swings wide, Beauregard, you go 90 feet?

3870
02:43:57.050 --> 02:43:58.100
MARISHA: I go 90 feet.

3871
02:43:58.100 --> 02:43:59.399
LIAM: It looked way worse.

3872
02:43:59.399 --> 02:44:03.347
LAURA: As blood trickles down.

3873
02:44:03.347 --> 02:44:06.157
MATT: You dart, Naruto run through the chamber,

3874
02:44:06.157 --> 02:44:07.798
rocks and stones flying behind you.

3875
02:44:07.798 --> 02:44:10.823
A cloud of dust, Roadrunner-style, is left in your wake

3876
02:44:10.823 --> 02:44:14.040
as you dart through and around, very easily catching up to

3877
02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:16.190
this large demonic general creature

3878
02:44:16.190 --> 02:44:17.640
that's made it's way through that portal.

3879
02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:18.997
What are you doing?

3880
02:44:18.997 --> 02:44:22.980
MARISHA: I'm going to use that momentum and parkour

3881
02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:27.980
off of the little stalagmite and come in with an elbow

3882
02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:30.570
to try and go to this guy's like back of his head.

3883
02:44:30.570 --> 02:44:31.520
MATT: Go for it.

3884
02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:33.189
LAURA: Parkour elbow!

3885
02:44:33.189 --> 02:44:36.998
MARISHA: Parkour elbow! People's elbow!

3886
02:44:36.998 --> 02:44:39.890
SAM: Naruto-regard!

3887
02:44:39.890 --> 02:44:42.633
MARISHA: 13 was almost good.

3888
02:44:42.633 --> 02:44:44.591
MATT: You cut, you jump and parkour.

3889
02:44:44.591 --> 02:44:46.340
You're in the middle of the air, and as you're coming down,

3890
02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:48.230
the creature is impacted by the Sacred Flame

3891
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:50.613
that Caduceus hit and its wing opens up

3892
02:44:50.613 --> 02:44:52.843
from just the reaction of the impact.

3893
02:44:52.843 --> 02:44:54.240
The wing batters you and you completely slide off

3894
02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:56.260
its side, landing on the ground in front of it.

3895
02:44:56.260 --> 02:45:00.143
MARISHA: My other attack plus my hasted attack.

3896
02:45:00.143 --> 02:45:02.910
Jesus, it's another five.

3897
02:45:02.910 --> 02:45:04.400
What's with these fives?

3898
02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:07.770
Then I have a 13.

3899
02:45:07.770 --> 02:45:10.895
I have been rolling terribly, plus eight. 20.

3900
02:45:10.895 --> 02:45:13.511
MATT: That does hit. Third attack does hit. Roll damage.

3901
02:45:13.511 --> 02:45:14.578
MARISHA: 21.

3902
02:45:14.578 --> 02:45:16.522
LIAM: Were any of those your hasted actions?

3903
02:45:16.522 --> 02:45:17.726
MARISHA: That last one was.

3904
02:45:17.726 --> 02:45:19.339
LIAM: Okay.

3905
02:45:19.339 --> 02:45:23.980
MARISHA: Six damage. Rolled a one.

3906
02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:25.320
Feeling like this is a trend.

3907
02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:26.560
MATT: Using your staff with these?

3908
02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:28.593
MARISHA: No, I'm using my fists.

3909
02:45:28.593 --> 02:45:30.323
MATT: Good call. All righty.

3910
02:45:30.323 --> 02:45:32.922
MARISHA: Then.

3911
02:45:32.922 --> 02:45:34.780
MATT: Bonus action?

3912
02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:38.393
MARISHA: Bonus action, oh wait, you know what?

3913
02:45:38.393 --> 02:45:39.768
I'm going to stun him with that last hit.

3914
02:45:39.768 --> 02:45:41.009
MATT: Stunning strike?

3915
02:45:41.009 --> 02:45:42.490
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3916
02:45:42.490 --> 02:45:43.630
MATT: This is not a magical effect.

3917
02:45:43.630 --> 02:45:47.247
Physical ability does not have resistance against it.

3918
02:45:47.247 --> 02:45:50.300
That is with a...

3919
02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:51.975
13.

3920
02:45:51.975 --> 02:45:53.333
MARISHA: He's stunned!

3921
02:45:53.333 --> 02:45:54.870
MATT: He's stunned.

3922
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:56.442
SAM: Quick, punch Liam in the face.

3923
02:45:56.442 --> 02:45:59.383
MARISHA: I just charged it.

3924
02:46:00.458 --> 02:46:03.270
It was all worth it.

3925
02:46:03.270 --> 02:46:06.400
MATT: As you angrily start pummeling, you find one open area

3926
02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:08.240
toward where the wings expand.

3927
02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:09.641
It's not even paying attention to you.

3928
02:46:09.641 --> 02:46:11.125
It's honed in on Jester.

3929
02:46:11.125 --> 02:46:13.540
As you reach beneath where its wings are,

3930
02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:15.400
you see an area where you think maybe a kidney

3931
02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:17.190
or some sort of sensitive spot may be.

3932
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:20.092
As your first hits the inside, you hear a snap

3933
02:46:20.092 --> 02:46:24.658
or some crack on the inside, and it tenses in.

3934
02:46:24.658 --> 02:46:27.675
Its body stops moving, its muscles locked in place.

3935
02:46:27.675 --> 02:46:30.529
LIAM: That's actually where its balls are.

3936
02:46:30.529 --> 02:46:33.511
MATT: It has seven of them, they're all hidden.

3937
02:46:33.511 --> 02:46:35.686
LAURA: Advantage, or auto-crit?

3938
02:46:35.686 --> 02:46:37.819
MATT: Not auto-crit. That's paralyzed.

3939
02:46:37.819 --> 02:46:38.990
You have advantage on attacks against it.

3940
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:42.230
MARISHA: Which means I'm going to use my bonus action

3941
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:43.883
to do a Flurry of Blows.

3942
02:46:43.883 --> 02:46:45.325
MATT: You got it, another ki point, go for it.

3943
02:46:45.325 --> 02:46:46.650
SAM: Flurry of Blow-regard!

3944
02:46:46.650 --> 02:46:49.616
MARISHA: What the fucking fuck? Stop, it's got to be you!

3945
02:46:49.616 --> 02:46:53.670
LIAM: You've got to stop. That's three for three.

3946
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:55.900
Every time you've made that joke, you fuck her rolls up.

3947
02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:58.970
SAM: I have the power!

3948
02:46:58.970 --> 02:47:02.530
MARISHA: One's a 15, the other is a ten.

3949
02:47:02.530 --> 02:47:03.720
MATT: You have advantage on these attacks,

3950
02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:04.553
so that was your first.

3951
02:47:04.553 --> 02:47:06.220
MARISHA: Oh, right, so 15.

3952
02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:08.061
MATT: 15 misses. Or you strike and

3953
02:47:08.061 --> 02:47:10.436
the demonic hide of this creature is too thick.

3954
02:47:10.436 --> 02:47:12.645
You can't manage to pierce through to do any real damage.

3955
02:47:12.645 --> 02:47:14.540
Your second attack with advantage.

3956
02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:17.143
LIAM: Come on, man.

3957
02:47:17.143 --> 02:47:20.440
MARISHA: It's a 13 and a 12. That gets me to 21.

3958
02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:22.901
MATT: 21 does hit.

3959
02:47:22.901 --> 02:47:23.734
MARISHA: Wow.

3960
02:47:23.734 --> 02:47:27.865
SAM: That's right. It's all on me.

3961
02:47:27.865 --> 02:47:32.865
MARISHA: Got to have someone to blame. That's nine damage.

3962
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:35.065
MATT: As you manage to actually-- pummeling it once more.

3963
02:47:35.065 --> 02:47:39.140
One blow does move past its heavy hided demonic armor

3964
02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:42.080
and strike it in a soft spot. That the end of your turn?

3965
02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:43.580
MARISHA: Yeah, do I have any more movement,

3966
02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:45.418
or was that the full 90?

3967
02:47:45.418 --> 02:47:50.050
MATT: You haven't used your full 90. You are about 80.

3968
02:47:50.050 --> 02:47:52.280
MARISHA: Can I get around to the side of it?

3969
02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:55.350
MATT: You can move.

3970
02:47:55.350 --> 02:47:57.680
Not really, because this is rough terrain here to get past.

3971
02:47:57.680 --> 02:48:00.270
You can't really stop on it. That's where you are.

3972
02:48:00.270 --> 02:48:02.786
MARISHA: Can I scoot back just five feet,

3973
02:48:02.786 --> 02:48:04.411
even though it probably doesn't--

3974
02:48:04.411 --> 02:48:05.244
MATT: You can back up there.

3975
02:48:05.244 --> 02:48:06.541
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

3976
02:48:06.541 --> 02:48:07.941
MATT: Doesn't get any attacks on you.

3977
02:48:07.941 --> 02:48:09.273
That finishes your turn.

3978
02:48:09.273 --> 02:48:10.106
MARISHA: That's my turn.

3979
02:48:10.106 --> 02:48:12.197
MATT: All righty. Fjord, you're up.

3980
02:48:12.197 --> 02:48:17.197
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll go 15 feet even further into the tunnel

3981
02:48:17.259 --> 02:48:19.470
because I'm fucking wrecked.

3982
02:48:19.470 --> 02:48:20.553
MATT: Okay.

3983
02:48:20.553 --> 02:48:24.901
TRAVIS: I will hold two Eldritch Blasts in my hands

3984
02:48:24.901 --> 02:48:27.443
if I can see him.

3985
02:48:27.443 --> 02:48:29.434
MATT: Got it. That's the end of your turn.

3986
02:48:29.434 --> 02:48:32.100
All righty, Fjord finishes his go. Yasha.

3987
02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:35.250
Yasha is going to turn.

3988
02:48:35.250 --> 02:48:38.300
TRAVIS: Does she make any a save or anything?

3989
02:48:40.085 --> 02:48:41.527
MATT: What's Yasha's speed?

3990
02:48:41.527 --> 02:48:42.793
TRAVIS: It's 40.

3991
02:48:42.793 --> 02:48:46.036
MATT: 40, so she moves there.

3992
02:48:46.036 --> 02:48:50.935
Five, ten, 15, 30, 35, 40, yeah.

3993
02:48:50.935 --> 02:48:52.560
TRAVIS: No save against it, right?

3994
02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:55.643
MATT: Nope. She's going to--

3995
02:48:55.643 --> 02:48:57.550
LAURA: Unless she gets damaged.

3996
02:48:57.550 --> 02:49:00.670
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

3997
02:49:00.670 --> 02:49:03.970
MATT: Just get right there.

3998
02:49:03.970 --> 02:49:07.590
Stand in space. Blade there.

3999
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:10.730
Between Beauregard and the creature.

4000
02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:12.714
That's all that happens.

4001
02:49:12.714 --> 02:49:17.070
That's all she does. Uses a bonus action to rage.

4002
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:19.470
Or to maintain-- does the rage drop at the end of her turn?

4003
02:49:19.470 --> 02:49:20.303
TRAVIS: Yep.

4004
02:49:20.303 --> 02:49:21.850
MATT: Just keeps the rage up.

4005
02:49:21.850 --> 02:49:23.716
TRAVIS: Okay.

4006
02:49:23.716 --> 02:49:28.632
MATT: All righty. Another rage used. Nott, you're up.

4007
02:49:28.632 --> 02:49:30.148
Everyone has left the chamber.

4008
02:49:30.148 --> 02:49:34.590
SAM: I will follow Yasha that way.

4009
02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:36.960
Do I see the sucky succubus?

4010
02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:38.860
MATT: You do. You see the incubus,

4011
02:49:38.860 --> 02:49:41.388
who is currently flying up on the wall in the air.

4012
02:49:41.388 --> 02:49:42.354
SAM: Oh, it's ethereal.

4013
02:49:42.354 --> 02:49:45.417
MATT: But it is ethereal. Its form is not corporeal.

4014
02:49:45.417 --> 02:49:48.069
LAURA: Can you move far enough to see Yasha?

4015
02:49:48.069 --> 02:49:50.600
SAM: I've just moved like 25 feet?

4016
02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:51.433
MATT: You were just 35.

4017
02:49:51.433 --> 02:49:54.650
That's the extent of your movement there.

4018
02:49:54.650 --> 02:49:59.650
SAM: I guess I'll bonus action keep moving, and--

4019
02:50:00.358 --> 02:50:03.416
MATT: 20, 25, 30, 35. You can see.

4020
02:50:03.416 --> 02:50:05.120
SAM: Oh, I can see the big beast.

4021
02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:06.766
MATT: Yep. That's your full movement.

4022
02:50:06.766 --> 02:50:07.916
You can move further back if you want to,

4023
02:50:07.916 --> 02:50:09.083
like not go as far, but--

4024
02:50:09.083 --> 02:50:10.880
SAM: Well, if I can shoot, I'll shoot the beast.

4025
02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:12.380
It's engaged, right?

4026
02:50:12.380 --> 02:50:13.910
MATT: It is engaged.

4027
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:15.500
Actually, no, it is not engaged.

4028
02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:17.160
But it is stunned, which is advantage on the attack,

4029
02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:18.572
which gives you sneak attack on anyone.

4030
02:50:18.572 --> 02:50:20.040
You're fine.
SAM: I will attack, yes.

4031
02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:21.250
MATT: You have advantage on it.

4032
02:50:21.250 --> 02:50:22.470
SAM: That's fine, that's fine.

4033
02:50:22.470 --> 02:50:24.700
17 plus nine is a lot.

4034
02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:28.405
26.
MATT: 26, yeah.

4035
02:50:28.405 --> 02:50:32.600
SAM: Okay, 12, 13, 14, 15.

4036
02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:35.260
21.
MATT: 21 points of damage.

4037
02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:36.800
Nice.

4038
02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:41.573
The bolt sinks deep, like halfway into its body.

4039
02:50:41.573 --> 02:50:43.670
That's your attack.
SAM: That's great.

4040
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:44.503
That's it.
MATT: All right.

4041
02:50:44.503 --> 02:50:46.639
That ends your turn.
SAM: Useful.

4042
02:50:46.639 --> 02:50:47.650
MATT: Top of the round, Jester, you are up.

4043
02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:49.380
The creature, who is now stalking towards you,

4044
02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:52.623
you watch just go (grunting) and you see Beau

4045
02:50:52.623 --> 02:50:57.386
behind it, like a blur of motion of brown and blue and gray

4046
02:50:57.386 --> 02:51:01.080
as she stops there, glances over towards you.

4047
02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:02.460
LAURA: Is he stunned?
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

4048
02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:03.293
LAURA: He's stunned?

4049
02:51:04.130 --> 02:51:06.230
Guiding Bolt, level three.

4050
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:07.750
MATT: Guiding Bolt, all righty.

4051
02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:12.380
Go ahead and roll with advantage.

4052
02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:14.425
MARISHA: Guiding Bolt up the butt.

4053
02:51:14.425 --> 02:51:19.425
LAURA: 17 plus-- that's 6d6 of radiant damage.

4054
02:51:19.682 --> 02:51:20.932
MARISHA: Come on.

4055
02:51:20.932 --> 02:51:22.520
MATT: Just as a note, if you want to,

4056
02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:24.100
since I know you don't get to use it very often,

4057
02:51:24.100 --> 02:51:25.830
because he's stunned, he doesn't get any attacks

4058
02:51:25.830 --> 02:51:28.203
of opportunity on you if you move in and out.

4059
02:51:28.203 --> 02:51:30.080
LAURA: I know, Inflict Wounds.

4060
02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:31.290
MATT: I just know how much you want to use that ability.

4061
02:51:31.290 --> 02:51:33.130
LAURA: I know, but I don't want to waste my movement

4062
02:51:33.130 --> 02:51:34.735
moving in and then moving back out, that's the only reason

4063
02:51:34.735 --> 02:51:36.552
I didn't do it.
But thank you.

4064
02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:38.007
MATT: I just know how badly
you want to use that.

4065
02:51:38.007 --> 02:51:39.727
LAURA: Ten plus--

4066
02:51:41.390 --> 02:51:45.070
16, 18, 20 points of radiant damage.

4067
02:51:45.070 --> 02:51:46.887
MATT: 20 points of radiant damage.

4068
02:51:46.887 --> 02:51:48.143
SAM: Damn, these are good hits.

4069
02:51:48.143 --> 02:51:49.987
He probably has is 600 points, but whatever.

4070
02:51:49.987 --> 02:51:51.280
MATT: The next strike against it does have advantage,

4071
02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:52.680
but its stunned, so it also gives him advantage,

4072
02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:54.870
but that's a nice heavy blast that burns across

4073
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:56.782
the front of its chest and under its jaw,

4074
02:51:56.782 --> 02:52:00.480
you can see its like darkened leathery demon skin

4075
02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:04.019
is now just slammed with darkened burn spots.

4076
02:52:04.019 --> 02:52:08.250
LAURA: I'm going to take my movement to back into--

4077
02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:11.400
I'm going to go around and back

4078
02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:14.179
behind the stalagmite.
MATT: Over here?

4079
02:52:14.179 --> 02:52:15.179
LAURA: Yeah.

4080
02:52:17.250 --> 02:52:18.744
MATT: You got it.

4081
02:52:18.744 --> 02:52:19.577
All right, that finishes your turn.

4082
02:52:19.577 --> 02:52:20.410
LAURA: Can you use bonus action to hide?

4083
02:52:20.410 --> 02:52:21.770
I don't remember if I can do that.

4084
02:52:21.770 --> 02:52:24.225
MATT: You cannot do that.
LAURA: Damn it.

4085
02:52:24.225 --> 02:52:25.080
MATT: That is a rogue thing.
LAURA: Okay, cool.

4086
02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:27.260
MATT: All right, that finishes your go, Jester.

4087
02:52:27.260 --> 02:52:30.393
The incubus is going to fly.

4088
02:52:31.882 --> 02:52:33.282
MARISHA: This piece of shit right here.

4089
02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:36.988
This piece of shit.

4090
02:52:36.988 --> 02:52:38.278
MATT: It's going to fly over to this side

4091
02:52:38.278 --> 02:52:39.944
and remain ethereal.

4092
02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:43.705
TALIESIN: Don't even know what you do about that.

4093
02:52:43.705 --> 02:52:45.644
MATT: That's going to stay right there.

4094
02:52:45.644 --> 02:52:47.155
LAURA: I don't think it can do anything while it moves,

4095
02:52:47.155 --> 02:52:48.161
that's a good thing.

4096
02:52:48.161 --> 02:52:49.570
MATT: That finishes its turn.

4097
02:52:49.570 --> 02:52:54.570
The large demon creature is stunned on its turn.

4098
02:52:55.319 --> 02:52:56.500
It isn't until the end of your turn, Beau.

4099
02:52:56.500 --> 02:52:58.640
That's its turn.

4100
02:52:58.640 --> 02:52:59.490
Caleb, you're up.

4101
02:53:00.650 --> 02:53:03.632
LIAM: I'm just going to creep around the corner

4102
02:53:03.632 --> 02:53:06.510
and keep three quarters cover and try to see

4103
02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:08.440
the thing that is hurting my friends.

4104
02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:11.840
I am going to just lob a little fire bolt at it.

4105
02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:13.590
MATT: All right.
LIAM: That's it.

4106
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:14.760
MATT: You have advantage on the attack roll,

4107
02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:16.900
but it does have three quarters cover if you do.

4108
02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:18.120
LIAM: Okay, yeah.

4109
02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:21.390
That means a straight roll, right?

4110
02:53:21.390 --> 02:53:22.740
MATT: No, it means it adds plus five to its AC.

4111
02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:24.657
LIAM: It has plus five, okay.

4112
02:53:26.221 --> 02:53:27.970
It's advantage plus five.

4113
02:53:27.970 --> 02:53:29.585
It has plus five.

4114
02:53:29.585 --> 02:53:31.290
12 plus eight is 20.

4115
02:53:32.446 --> 02:53:33.290
MATT: 20 would miss.
LIAM: Okay.

4116
02:53:34.704 --> 02:53:36.200
I'm going to stay where I am.

4117
02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:37.160
MATT: Okay, there you go.

4118
02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:38.730
That's end of Caleb's go.

4119
02:53:38.730 --> 02:53:39.730
Caduceus, you're up.

4120
02:53:40.690 --> 02:53:41.906
SAM: Caddyshack!

4121
02:53:42.827 --> 02:53:46.690
TALIESIN: I'm going to just measure the distance,

4122
02:53:46.690 --> 02:53:49.390
see if I've got 30 feet on this guy.

4123
02:53:52.300 --> 02:53:53.760
MATT: He's just within 30 feet.

4124
02:53:54.626 --> 02:53:55.760
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to.

4125
02:53:58.306 --> 02:54:02.710
I'm going to hold my action.

4126
02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:03.965
MATT: Okay.

4127
02:54:03.965 --> 02:54:05.765
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold a--

4128
02:54:08.410 --> 02:54:10.528
where is it, where did it go?

4129
02:54:12.612 --> 02:54:14.730
Oh, actually, no, I should probably not do that.

4130
02:54:14.730 --> 02:54:17.210
That would be a foolish thing to do, sorry.

4131
02:54:17.210 --> 02:54:18.530
MATT: Come on.

4132
02:54:19.382 --> 02:54:21.057
Beau, you're on deck.
TALIESIN: I know.

4133
02:54:21.057 --> 02:54:21.890
LAURA: Oh no.

4134
02:54:23.898 --> 02:54:26.330
How many ki points do you have left?

4135
02:54:26.330 --> 02:54:28.330
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm just going to

4136
02:54:28.330 --> 02:54:31.040
do another sacred flame.

4137
02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:31.873
MATT: Okay.

4138
02:54:33.269 --> 02:54:34.510
Because it is stunned, it automatically fails

4139
02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:35.690
dexterity saving throws.

4140
02:54:35.690 --> 02:54:37.014
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's nice.

4141
02:54:37.014 --> 02:54:38.614
LAURA: That's great.

4142
02:54:38.614 --> 02:54:40.738
Damn. That'd been good to know.

4143
02:54:40.738 --> 02:54:42.308
TALIESIN: That's, ooh, that's nice.

4144
02:54:42.308 --> 02:54:44.574
MATT: Yeah, I hate stun. But then I love it.

4145
02:54:44.574 --> 02:54:46.933
MARISHA: It fucking works.

4146
02:54:46.933 --> 02:54:48.293
TALIESIN: 19 points of radiant damage.

4147
02:54:48.293 --> 02:54:50.987
MATT: 19 points of radiant, not bad for a cantrip, buddy.

4148
02:54:50.987 --> 02:54:52.362
LAURA: Shit.

4149
02:54:52.362 --> 02:54:54.092
That matches my third level spell.

4150
02:54:55.180 --> 02:54:57.290
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not moving, I'm not doing,

4151
02:54:57.290 --> 02:54:59.450
I'm just going to--
MATT: Stand right there?

4152
02:54:59.450 --> 02:55:00.490
You got it.

4153
02:55:00.490 --> 02:55:01.571
All right.

4154
02:55:01.571 --> 02:55:03.070
That brings us to Beauregard.

4155
02:55:03.070 --> 02:55:05.399
MARISHA: I am just laying into this guy.

4156
02:55:05.399 --> 02:55:07.137
MATT: Keeping track of your haste turns?

4157
02:55:07.137 --> 02:55:08.803
MARISHA: Yes. I have four left,

4158
02:55:08.803 --> 02:55:10.462
it's only been two rounds, right?

4159
02:55:10.462 --> 02:55:12.333
MATT: This is your third, so--
MARISHA: At the end of this,

4160
02:55:12.333 --> 02:55:13.683
it will be three.
MATT: Correct.

4161
02:55:15.232 --> 02:55:17.520
MARISHA: I'm going to drop to a knee

4162
02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:21.160
and go for some glute punches.
MATT: Towards the creature?

4163
02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:22.762
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: All right.

4164
02:55:22.762 --> 02:55:23.937
You're going to dart back into combat?

4165
02:55:23.937 --> 02:55:24.770
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: You're probably have

4166
02:55:24.770 --> 02:55:26.920
to move around Yasha to get to it back there for the glute.

4167
02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:27.753
MARISHA: That's okay.

4168
02:55:27.753 --> 02:55:29.694
MATT: All right. You dodge past Yasha and

4169
02:55:29.694 --> 02:55:31.286
you're going to go in for the glute punches.

4170
02:55:31.286 --> 02:55:32.923
MARISHA: I still have advantage, right?

4171
02:55:32.923 --> 02:55:34.311
MATT: Correct, because it's stunned.

4172
02:55:34.311 --> 02:55:36.452
MARISHA: Okay, first attack.

4173
02:55:36.452 --> 02:55:37.689
MARISHA: Two 11's.

4174
02:55:37.689 --> 02:55:39.827
MATT: Still stunned. It's stunned until the end of her turn.

4175
02:55:39.827 --> 02:55:41.760
MARISHA: That's almost impressive. 19.

4176
02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:42.593
MATT: 19 hits.

4177
02:55:42.593 --> 02:55:44.740
MARISHA: Beautiful.

4178
02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:48.710
Six damage.

4179
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:50.020
I'm not crazy, right?

4180
02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:52.189
TRAVIS: You're not crazy, this happened.

4181
02:55:52.189 --> 02:55:53.022
MARISHA: Next one.

4182
02:55:53.022 --> 02:55:55.584
SAM: You reap what you sow-regard!

4183
02:55:55.584 --> 02:55:57.025
MARISHA: I'm stunning it.

4184
02:55:57.025 --> 02:55:58.000
MATT: You're stunning it again?

4185
02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.375
MARISHA: Yeah. Stunning Strike.

4186
02:56:01.458 --> 02:56:04.974
MATT: That is going to be 15.

4187
02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:07.933
MARISHA: Yeah, that saves.

4188
02:56:07.933 --> 02:56:09.476
MATT: Sorry.

4189
02:56:09.476 --> 02:56:14.443
MARISHA: The next attack is another 19 to hit.

4190
02:56:15.855 --> 02:56:17.333
MATT: Because you rolled advantage on the other strike?

4191
02:56:17.333 --> 02:56:19.400
Yeah, so that hits.

4192
02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:21.242
MARISHA: 19, please be anything other than one.

4193
02:56:21.242 --> 02:56:22.617
TRAVIS: It's a two!

4194
02:56:23.916 --> 02:56:25.241
Oh my god.

4195
02:56:25.241 --> 02:56:27.870
MARISHA: Ask and you shall receive.

4196
02:56:27.870 --> 02:56:29.920
Six, sorry, seven damage.

4197
02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:31.670
MATT: Seven damage, all right.

4198
02:56:33.106 --> 02:56:35.589
LIAM: Your eternal reward.

4199
02:56:37.445 --> 02:56:38.686
MATT: Up to you.

4200
02:56:40.503 --> 02:56:42.011
MARISHA: S-s-stunning strike.

4201
02:56:42.011 --> 02:56:43.253
MATT: Gonna use your last ki point?

4202
02:56:43.253 --> 02:56:44.086
MARISHA: Yeah.

4203
02:56:44.086 --> 02:56:45.185
MATT: Stunning strike again.

4204
02:56:45.185 --> 02:56:47.680
MARISHA: This is my last ki point.

4205
02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:48.855
LIAM: Oh, balls.

4206
02:56:48.855 --> 02:56:50.429
MATT: 19.

4207
02:56:51.558 --> 02:56:53.133
LIAM: So it works?

4208
02:56:53.133 --> 02:56:53.966
MATT: No.

4209
02:56:56.486 --> 02:56:58.931
LAURA: But we really want it to, though.

4210
02:56:58.931 --> 02:57:00.775
Does that make a difference?

4211
02:57:00.775 --> 02:57:02.829
MARISHA: One more attack because I'm still hasted.

4212
02:57:03.771 --> 02:57:05.470
LIAM: Brutal.

4213
02:57:05.470 --> 02:57:07.030
Five and a six.

4214
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:10.750
MARISHA: Yeah, so that's a 14, which I don't believe hits.

4215
02:57:10.750 --> 02:57:11.600
MATT: 14 does not hit.

4216
02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:13.582
TRAVIS: Is the incubus all spectral right now?

4217
02:57:13.582 --> 02:57:15.115
MATT: Yeah, still ethereal.

4218
02:57:15.115 --> 02:57:15.948
LIAM: Over and over.

4219
02:57:15.948 --> 02:57:18.139
MARISHA: With advantage, even.

4220
02:57:18.139 --> 02:57:19.306
LIAM: Hasted.

4221
02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:21.778
MATT: That finishes your turn?

4222
02:57:21.778 --> 02:57:24.444
MARISHA: Uh-huh, so what's my movement that I have left?

4223
02:57:24.444 --> 02:57:26.650
Because I did like 15 to get back in?

4224
02:57:26.650 --> 02:57:29.483
MATT: Correct, you still have--

4225
02:57:29.483 --> 02:57:30.720
MARISHA: Still hasted.

4226
02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:33.800
MATT: Yeah, so you still have 80 feet of movement.

4227
02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:36.490
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to get out and start heading

4228
02:57:36.490 --> 02:57:38.278
towards the corridor, if I can.

4229
02:57:38.278 --> 02:57:39.514
MATT: This way? Okay.

4230
02:57:39.514 --> 02:57:40.989
MARISHA: He's still stunned.

4231
02:57:40.989 --> 02:57:43.540
MATT: You move around, 20, 25. Yasha's going to

4232
02:57:43.540 --> 02:57:45.050
take another attack at you.

4233
02:57:45.050 --> 02:57:47.725
MARISHA: Have I really noticed her doing this yet?

4234
02:57:47.725 --> 02:57:49.120
MATT: You didn't notice her attacking last time.

4235
02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:50.990
You were just darting forward and the swing

4236
02:57:50.990 --> 02:57:52.598
just missed you from behind.

4237
02:57:52.598 --> 02:57:54.822
No damage, you didn't even notice it happened.

4238
02:57:54.822 --> 02:57:55.938
TRAVIS: Natural one.

4239
02:57:55.938 --> 02:57:57.480
SAM: Again?

4240
02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:58.397
TRAVIS: That was the first time.

4241
02:57:58.397 --> 02:57:59.571
LAURA: He rolled a two last time.

4242
02:57:59.571 --> 02:58:00.404
SAM: That's right.

4243
02:58:00.404 --> 02:58:02.470
MARISHA: I'm just still in my own little world.

4244
02:58:02.470 --> 02:58:04.040
MATT: Cannot fucking Sentinel, man.

4245
02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:05.930
I finally get a chance to use it against you guys

4246
02:58:05.930 --> 02:58:07.550
and you can't hit for me.

4247
02:58:07.550 --> 02:58:09.248
I want to roll next time, jesus.

4248
02:58:09.248 --> 02:58:11.023
LIAM: You've done pretty well today, Matt.

4249
02:58:11.023 --> 02:58:12.331
MATT: Yeah, you can get all the way over

4250
02:58:12.331 --> 02:58:13.572
into here, if you want.

4251
02:58:13.572 --> 02:58:15.060
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll be behind Caleb.

4252
02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:17.330
MATT: In the middle of that area there.

4253
02:58:17.330 --> 02:58:19.413
MARISHA: I still want to--

4254
02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:22.448
TRAVIS: Well, if it gets in the corridor, he's got that

4255
02:58:22.448 --> 02:58:23.907
long ass melee reach.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4256
02:58:23.907 --> 02:58:25.690
Yeah, I'll stay there though.

4257
02:58:25.690 --> 02:58:27.470
MATT: Okay, finishes Beauregard's turn.

4258
02:58:27.470 --> 02:58:29.920
It is no longer stunned, thank fucking god.

4259
02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:32.961
LIAM: Oh god. Oh god.

4260
02:58:32.961 --> 02:58:35.594
MATT: All righty. That brings us to--

4261
02:58:35.594 --> 02:58:37.902
SAM: Is it you and me out there? Oh, you're back there.

4262
02:58:37.902 --> 02:58:39.898
MATT: --Fjord. you're up.

4263
02:58:39.898 --> 02:58:41.805
TRAVIS: Can I see the incubus that's perched up--

4264
02:58:41.805 --> 02:58:43.418
that flew in and perched up?

4265
02:58:43.418 --> 02:58:45.041
MATT: From your current position?

4266
02:58:45.041 --> 02:58:45.874
Yes, you can.

4267
02:58:45.874 --> 02:58:47.293
TRAVIS: Oh, but he's all spectral.

4268
02:58:47.293 --> 02:58:48.775
TRAVIS: He's all spectral!

4269
02:58:48.775 --> 02:58:49.779
MATT: He is.

4270
02:58:52.552 --> 02:58:55.219
TRAVIS: I'm going to take this potion.

4271
02:58:56.496 --> 02:58:57.818
MATT: All right, drink the potion.

4272
02:58:57.818 --> 02:58:59.338
TALIESIN: You get max hit points from it.

4273
02:58:59.338 --> 02:59:01.461
LAURA: That's good.
TRAVIS: Oh, so it's for--

4274
02:59:01.461 --> 02:59:03.070
MATT: Ten, you heal ten.

4275
02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:06.120
TRAVIS: Ten points, I'll take it.

4276
02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:08.197
MATT: Hand it over.
TRAVIS: No.

4277
02:59:08.197 --> 02:59:10.922
(laughing)

4278
02:59:12.179 --> 02:59:13.600
TRAVIS: There you go.
MATT: Thank you.

4279
02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:18.323
All righty, so is that the end of your turn?

4280
02:59:18.323 --> 02:59:19.326
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4281
02:59:19.326 --> 02:59:21.829
(yodeling)

4282
02:59:21.829 --> 02:59:23.326
(laughter)

4283
02:59:23.326 --> 02:59:24.818
LAURA: Yee-haw!

4284
02:59:26.484 --> 02:59:28.910
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the end of it.

4285
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:30.030
MATT: All right.

4286
02:59:31.806 --> 02:59:33.564
Yasha's go.

4287
02:59:33.564 --> 02:59:34.747
LIAM: Oh, gosh.

4288
02:59:34.747 --> 02:59:37.314
LAURA: No.
LIAM: Holy hell.

4289
02:59:37.314 --> 02:59:39.600
LAURA: No!
LIAM: Holy shit, you guys.

4290
02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:42.210
SAM: Oh, Yasha v. Caleb.
LAURA: What does it feel like,

4291
02:59:42.210 --> 02:59:43.809
Caleb, what does it feel like?

4292
02:59:43.809 --> 02:59:45.598
MATT: She's going to attack recklessly, twice on Caleb.

4293
02:59:45.598 --> 02:59:46.895
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: He's gone, he's gone.

4294
02:59:46.895 --> 02:59:48.578
TRAVIS: You never know.

4295
02:59:48.578 --> 02:59:49.953
It could be double ones.

4296
02:59:49.953 --> 02:59:51.594
SAM: Can you shield?

4297
02:59:51.594 --> 02:59:53.769
LIAM: All right, but.
MARISHA: You're okay.

4298
02:59:53.769 --> 02:59:55.570
TRAVIS: Natural one.

4299
02:59:55.570 --> 02:59:58.900
LIAM: Okay, thank you.
TRAVIS: And a 10, for 16.

4300
03:00:00.050 --> 03:00:01.920
LIAM: Shield.

4301
03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:03.220
MATT: Okay.

4302
03:00:03.220 --> 03:00:04.053
So.

4303
03:00:05.214 --> 03:00:06.800
Shielded on the first strike.

4304
03:00:06.800 --> 03:00:09.890
Keep tabs on your AC buff, you're up to 19 AC now?

4305
03:00:09.890 --> 03:00:11.026
Right?

4306
03:00:11.026 --> 03:00:12.040
All right, second attack reckless.

4307
03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:14.101
TRAVIS: This barbarian dice, like,

4308
03:00:14.101 --> 03:00:15.801
trying to help the barbarians out.

4309
03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:19.060
Ooh. 21.
LIAM: Hits.

4310
03:00:19.060 --> 03:00:22.810
MATT: Yes, go ahead and roll that full damage.

4311
03:00:22.810 --> 03:00:24.823
TRAVIS: Oh, right, me, okay.

4312
03:00:26.608 --> 03:00:28.160
This is the divine--

4313
03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:29.840
MATT: Yeah. It's the first strike of the turn.

4314
03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:33.330
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh.

4315
03:00:33.330 --> 03:00:37.240
Yeah, 15, 17, 20 points of slashing damage.

4316
03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:38.739
LIAM: Gotcha.

4317
03:00:38.739 --> 03:00:40.921
SAM: You okay, buddy?

4318
03:00:40.921 --> 03:00:42.576
LAURA: How you doing, Caleb?

4319
03:00:42.576 --> 03:00:44.076
LIAM: You don't know.

4320
03:00:44.076 --> 03:00:46.406
(laughter)

4321
03:00:46.406 --> 03:00:48.620
LAURA: I'm seeing it happen right in front of me, actually.

4322
03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:51.870
MATT: That finishes Yasha's turn and now you all know

4323
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:54.620
that Yasha is not on your side.

4324
03:00:54.620 --> 03:00:56.670
MARISHA: Gasp.

4325
03:00:56.670 --> 03:00:57.970
MATT: <i>Now</i> you know.

4326
03:00:57.970 --> 03:00:59.510
All righty, that finishes her turn.

4327
03:00:59.510 --> 03:01:01.120
Nott, you're up.
SAM: Me?

4328
03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:02.890
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Oh boys-y.

4329
03:01:06.430 --> 03:01:07.890
Oh boy.

4330
03:01:07.890 --> 03:01:10.925
The thing is not engaged with any of us, right?

4331
03:01:10.925 --> 03:01:13.190
MATT: Nope.
SAM: I saw Yasha attack Caleb.

4332
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:14.665
I don't like that.

4333
03:01:16.580 --> 03:01:17.710
Boy.

4334
03:01:17.710 --> 03:01:19.035
This is tricky.

4335
03:01:19.996 --> 03:01:21.690
Okay.

4336
03:01:21.690 --> 03:01:24.360
I will shoot Yasha in the back of the head.

4337
03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:25.977
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: Yep.

4338
03:01:27.220 --> 03:01:29.245
SAM: That's not very good.

4339
03:01:29.245 --> 03:01:31.094
LIAM: She's engaged with your ally.

4340
03:01:31.094 --> 03:01:32.510
You have advantage.
SAM: Oh.

4341
03:01:32.510 --> 03:01:33.930
LIAM: I'm your ally.
SAM: Is that right?

4342
03:01:33.930 --> 03:01:34.958
MATT: Yeah.

4343
03:01:34.958 --> 03:01:36.724
Well, you don't have advantage.

4344
03:01:36.724 --> 03:01:38.299
But you get sneak attack damage if it hits.

4345
03:01:38.299 --> 03:01:39.683
SAM: All right, 18 to hit.

4346
03:01:39.683 --> 03:01:41.440
LAURA: Yeah, rogue.
MATT: On the first attack?

4347
03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:43.556
That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4348
03:01:43.556 --> 03:01:45.256
SAM: And I get sneak attack?

4349
03:01:45.256 --> 03:01:46.105
MATT: You do.

4350
03:01:46.105 --> 03:01:48.335
LAURA: That's okay, she's got a lot of hit points.

4351
03:01:48.335 --> 03:01:50.000
TRAVIS: She's fine, she's stout right now.

4352
03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:51.940
SAM: Okay, not terrible.

4353
03:01:53.050 --> 03:01:55.450
14 plus, 20 points of damage.

4354
03:01:55.450 --> 03:01:57.530
MATT: 20 points of damage to Yasha.

4355
03:01:57.530 --> 03:01:59.535
Halved to ten because it is piercing,

4356
03:01:59.535 --> 03:02:01.393
because she's raging.

4357
03:02:01.393 --> 03:02:03.088
She makes another wisdom saving throw.

4358
03:02:03.088 --> 03:02:04.488
LAURA: Come on, Yasha.

4359
03:02:04.488 --> 03:02:06.029
MATT: With advantage because of the Beacon of Hope.

4360
03:02:06.029 --> 03:02:07.710
LAURA: Yasha-Yasha-Yasha-Yasha.

4361
03:02:07.710 --> 03:02:10.570
TRAVIS: Wisdom saving throw?
MATT: Wisdom saving throw.

4362
03:02:10.570 --> 03:02:12.660
LIAM: Two bad dice.
TRAVIS: 10.

4363
03:02:12.660 --> 03:02:13.820
MATT: 10?

4364
03:02:13.820 --> 03:02:15.490
No, it's a fail.

4365
03:02:15.490 --> 03:02:17.900
She's still affected.

4366
03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:21.408
SAM: I wait for a second to see if she seems nice.

4367
03:02:21.408 --> 03:02:24.262
MATT: There's no effect.
SAM: I shoot her again.

4368
03:02:24.262 --> 03:02:26.504
(laughter)

4369
03:02:27.389 --> 03:02:29.800
Oh, 17 to hit.

4370
03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:30.633
MATT: Armor class?

4371
03:02:30.633 --> 03:02:32.628
TRAVIS: That hits. Her AC is 14.

4372
03:02:32.628 --> 03:02:34.310
SAM: Really?

4373
03:02:34.310 --> 03:02:36.680
You know, just nine points of damage.

4374
03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:38.740
MATT: Reduce to four.

4375
03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:40.800
Then roll again.

4376
03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:43.280
LAURA: Yasha-Yasha-Yasha.
TRAVIS: With advantage, right?

4377
03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:46.288
LIAM: Come on, yeah. 16s.

4378
03:02:46.288 --> 03:02:48.400
MARISHA: Why does--doubles again?

4379
03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:50.925
TRAVIS: That's the third roll in a row, yeah. 15.

4380
03:02:50.925 --> 03:02:52.200
MATT: 15?

4381
03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:53.500
TALIESIN: Negative one save.

4382
03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:56.414
MATT: 15 does not save.

4383
03:02:56.414 --> 03:02:58.263
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

4384
03:02:59.190 --> 03:03:02.257
MATT: Just on the cusp.

4385
03:03:03.174 --> 03:03:04.520
SAM: Sorry, sorry.

4386
03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:06.678
MATT: Wait is it 16 or 15?

4387
03:03:06.678 --> 03:03:08.703
TRAVIS: Natural 16 minus one.

4388
03:03:08.703 --> 03:03:11.390
MATT: So 15, yeah. You just missed it.

4389
03:03:11.390 --> 03:03:15.420
SAM: Sorry, Yasha. I run away, backwards.

4390
03:03:15.420 --> 03:03:18.896
LIAM: Backwards into the chamber?

4391
03:03:18.896 --> 03:03:20.078
MATT: There you go.

4392
03:03:20.078 --> 03:03:22.524
SAM: Just out of sight. Not like eons away.

4393
03:03:22.524 --> 03:03:23.357
MATT: Like over there?

4394
03:03:23.357 --> 03:03:24.190
SAM: Yeah.

4395
03:03:24.190 --> 03:03:28.596
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go, Nott. Jester, you're up.

4396
03:03:28.596 --> 03:03:32.750
LAURA: Shit.

4397
03:03:32.750 --> 03:03:33.833
I'm going to...

4398
03:03:36.770 --> 03:03:39.300
Peek around the corner.

4399
03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:40.383
MATT: Barbarians aren't known

4400
03:03:40.383 --> 03:03:41.400
for their willpower, necessarily.

4401
03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:43.860
TRAVIS: Rolled the same number on all three rolls, though.

4402
03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:44.981
MATT: That is pretty crazy.

4403
03:03:44.981 --> 03:03:46.219
TRAVIS: Nines, 11's, 16's.

4404
03:03:46.219 --> 03:03:49.100
LAURA: I'm going to cast Dispel Magic at Yasha.

4405
03:03:49.100 --> 03:03:50.280
See if it works.

4406
03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:52.140
MATT: Okay, casting Dispel Magic at Yasha.

4407
03:03:52.140 --> 03:03:54.256
LAURA: Yeah.

4408
03:03:57.685 --> 03:03:59.610
Magical effect, yeah.

4409
03:03:59.610 --> 03:04:02.260
MATT: Yeah, I'll say, for the purposes of this,

4410
03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:05.760
go ahead and roll a wisdom check for me.

4411
03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:11.315
LAURA: 13. No. 14.

4412
03:04:11.315 --> 03:04:13.300
MATT: 14. I was going to use the DC of the ability

4413
03:04:13.300 --> 03:04:14.133
to try and dispel it,

4414
03:04:14.133 --> 03:04:16.860
but the Dispel has no effect, unfortunately, I'm sorry.

4415
03:04:16.860 --> 03:04:20.049
LAURA: Okay. Cool.

4416
03:04:20.049 --> 03:04:21.502
Okay, okay, okay.

4417
03:04:21.502 --> 03:04:23.850
SAM: This is the part of the fight where we suck.

4418
03:04:23.850 --> 03:04:25.133
TRAVIS: <i>This</i> is the part?

4419
03:04:25.133 --> 03:04:26.358
SAM: Yeah.

4420
03:04:27.615 --> 03:04:29.770
LAURA: Fuck me.

4421
03:04:29.770 --> 03:04:31.040
That's like all I--

4422
03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:32.340
TRAVIS: Now a warning.

4423
03:04:32.340 --> 03:04:34.857
LAURA: <i>Now</i> a warning?!

4424
03:04:34.857 --> 03:04:36.727
Yeah, that's it.

4425
03:04:36.727 --> 03:04:37.560
MATT: Are you going to stay put?

4426
03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:38.620
LAURA: I mean, yeah, why not?

4427
03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:40.360
MATT: Sure, all right, that finishes your go, Jester.

4428
03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:41.697
LAURA: What else am I going to do?

4429
03:04:41.697 --> 03:04:43.504
SAM: She's hidden a little bit. She's not going to go down

4430
03:04:43.504 --> 03:04:45.892
the hallway of death with you guys.

4431
03:04:45.892 --> 03:04:47.235
LAURA: (uncertain noise)

4432
03:04:47.235 --> 03:04:49.693
TALIESIN: It'll fill you up.

4433
03:04:49.693 --> 03:04:50.526
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to use

4434
03:04:50.526 --> 03:04:51.940
my bonus action to take my healing potion.

4435
03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:52.773
MATT: Go for it.

4436
03:04:52.773 --> 03:04:54.440
MARISHA: We're living our best 300 fantasy.

4437
03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:57.399
TRAVIS: This is the hallway of the infirm over here.

4438
03:04:57.399 --> 03:04:58.591
LAURA: 16 plus eight?

4439
03:04:58.591 --> 03:04:59.599
MATT: Yeah, you're still affected. You didn't get the

4440
03:04:59.599 --> 03:05:00.686
Beacon of Hope.
LAURA: Yes, I did.

4441
03:05:00.686 --> 03:05:02.228
The second casting.

4442
03:05:02.228 --> 03:05:03.644
MATT: That's right, you cast a second time, yeah.

4443
03:05:03.644 --> 03:05:04.680
That's 16 plus four.

4444
03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:05.690
LAURA: 16 plus four, okay.

4445
03:05:05.690 --> 03:05:07.777
MATT: Yes, you heal 20 points.

4446
03:05:07.777 --> 03:05:12.777
TRAVIS: [inaudible] (slamming) (crying)

4447
03:05:13.259 --> 03:05:15.440
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn, Jester.

4448
03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:17.080
Incubus is going to stay put,

4449
03:05:17.080 --> 03:05:19.560
and going to hold an action.

4450
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:23.210
Now these creatures turn.

4451
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:24.900
SAM: How do we get her out of the ethereal?

4452
03:05:24.900 --> 03:05:26.710
Is it him or her?
LAURA: Him.

4453
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:29.487
SAM: How do we get him out of the Ethereal Plane?

4454
03:05:29.487 --> 03:05:32.460
MATT: Step forward and make a distant claw strike

4455
03:05:32.460 --> 03:05:33.592
against you, Caleb.

4456
03:05:33.592 --> 03:05:35.980
LIAM: Yeah. I'm still at 19.

4457
03:05:35.980 --> 03:05:38.096
MATT: You are. That is going to be a 24 to hit.

4458
03:05:38.096 --> 03:05:39.533
LIAM: But that hits.

4459
03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:43.124
TRAVIS: Yeah. He hits way above 20.

4460
03:05:43.124 --> 03:05:44.571
MATT: You take 15 points of lightning damage.

4461
03:05:44.571 --> 03:05:46.621
LIAM: Good night.

4462
03:05:46.621 --> 03:05:47.721
LAURA: Are you unconscious?

4463
03:05:47.721 --> 03:05:48.840
LIAM: No, not yet.

4464
03:05:48.840 --> 03:05:50.700
MATT: Oh, not yet, I thought you said good night, sorry.

4465
03:05:50.700 --> 03:05:52.352
LIAM: No, just thought more was coming.

4466
03:05:52.352 --> 03:05:55.427
TALIESIN: He's just a believer in planning ahead.

4467
03:05:56.626 --> 03:05:59.665
MATT: It does not get its lance back.

4468
03:05:59.665 --> 03:06:01.014
It's going to take another strike at you.

4469
03:06:01.014 --> 03:06:02.248
LIAM: Cool.

4470
03:06:02.248 --> 03:06:03.323
SAM: (laughs) "Cool."

4471
03:06:03.323 --> 03:06:04.720
MATT: That's going to be a 19 exactly.

4472
03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:06.036
LIAM: Hits.

4473
03:06:08.290 --> 03:06:11.999
MATT: Ooh. That's 18 points of lightning damage.

4474
03:06:11.999 --> 03:06:14.015
LIAM: Down.

4475
03:06:15.288 --> 03:06:16.246
LAURA: Oh no!

4476
03:06:16.246 --> 03:06:19.329
TRAVIS: And the world did shake.

4477
03:06:19.329 --> 03:06:21.449
(thudding)

4478
03:06:21.449 --> 03:06:23.764
TALIESIN: Yeah, you currently also have advantage

4479
03:06:23.764 --> 03:06:25.430
to death saving throws.

4480
03:06:25.430 --> 03:06:28.143
LIAM: I remembered that, Tal.

4481
03:06:28.143 --> 03:06:31.428
MATT: Okay, and it's going to continue moving.

4482
03:06:31.428 --> 03:06:34.503
(thudding) Over into this space.

4483
03:06:34.503 --> 03:06:37.903
It's going to take an attack against you, Caduceus.

4484
03:06:40.262 --> 03:06:42.362
It doesn't have advantage. Why am I attacking with it?

4485
03:06:42.362 --> 03:06:44.095
That's a 20 to hit?

4486
03:06:44.095 --> 03:06:45.260
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, that hits.

4487
03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:48.937
LIAM: Haste is dropped and you're exhausted for a while.

4488
03:06:48.937 --> 03:06:50.103
MATT: Oh, you're stunned for a round.

4489
03:06:50.103 --> 03:06:51.328
SAM: Stunned!

4490
03:06:51.328 --> 03:06:53.644
MARISHA: Exhausted, exhausted.

4491
03:06:53.644 --> 03:06:56.212
MATT: Not exhausted, stunned for a round.

4492
03:06:56.212 --> 03:06:57.320
MARISHA: Stunned.

4493
03:06:57.320 --> 03:07:00.730
MATT: That's 16 points of lightning damage to you, Caduceus.

4494
03:07:00.730 --> 03:07:02.380
LAURA: Oh no, you guys.

4495
03:07:02.380 --> 03:07:04.670
TALIESIN: He's still distant to me, so I wouldn't get a--

4496
03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:07.171
that doesn't matter anyway, because he actually hit me.

4497
03:07:07.171 --> 03:07:09.310
MATT: He's clawing through the air and these lightning arcs

4498
03:07:09.310 --> 03:07:13.289
going off the claws with each strike.

4499
03:07:13.289 --> 03:07:14.880
LIAM: This is going to be

4500
03:07:14.880 --> 03:07:17.071
the saddest panels ever this weekend.

4501
03:07:17.071 --> 03:07:19.540
MARISHA: Shut your mouth!

4502
03:07:19.540 --> 03:07:21.798
MATT: That ends its turn.

4503
03:07:21.798 --> 03:07:23.480
Now it's Caleb's turn.

4504
03:07:23.480 --> 03:07:24.913
Need you to make a death saving throw for me.

4505
03:07:24.913 --> 03:07:27.912
LIAM: Sure, at advantage.

4506
03:07:27.912 --> 03:07:30.589
TRAVIS: (grunting)

4507
03:07:30.589 --> 03:07:33.166
LIAM: Fail. A six and a one.

4508
03:07:33.166 --> 03:07:34.153
MATT: Down one death save.

4509
03:07:34.153 --> 03:07:39.153
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Woo! (nervous laughter and yelling)

4510
03:07:39.672 --> 03:07:42.007
SAM: Travis is a soprano.

4511
03:07:42.007 --> 03:07:43.525
TRAVIS: Oh man!

4512
03:07:43.525 --> 03:07:45.430
MATT: All right, Caduceus, your turn.

4513
03:07:45.430 --> 03:07:47.798
SAM: I can't even get that high.

4514
03:07:47.798 --> 03:07:50.673
TALIESIN: All right, all right, all right.

4515
03:07:50.673 --> 03:07:52.080
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

4516
03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:55.163
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast-- let's see.

4517
03:07:57.860 --> 03:08:01.800
Just checking, if I use Healing Word

4518
03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:04.440
as a bonus action, I can't cast any other spells?

4519
03:08:04.440 --> 03:08:05.310
MATT: Other than a cantrip.

4520
03:08:05.310 --> 03:08:06.759
TALIESIN: Other than a cantrip.

4521
03:08:06.759 --> 03:08:10.117
In that case, first of all, I'm going to cast Healing Word.

4522
03:08:10.117 --> 03:08:11.258
SAM: Hey, look at that.

4523
03:08:11.258 --> 03:08:12.260
TALIESIN: You're at nine points.

4524
03:08:12.260 --> 03:08:13.093
MATT: I'll allow it.

4525
03:08:13.093 --> 03:08:16.690
The creature is big, but because you have a high enough

4526
03:08:16.690 --> 03:08:18.880
passive perception, I'll allow it, go for it.

4527
03:08:18.880 --> 03:08:21.610
Healing Word. You heal him up.

4528
03:08:21.610 --> 03:08:23.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, because one hit, and that'd be--

4529
03:08:23.232 --> 03:08:25.302
MARISHA: He'd be dead.

4530
03:08:25.302 --> 03:08:28.700
TALIESIN: Did I just do that right? Hold on. Sorry.

4531
03:08:29.980 --> 03:08:32.138
TRAVIS: He's just sitting at his feet.

4532
03:08:32.138 --> 03:08:33.388
SAM: Yasha's right above him.

4533
03:08:33.388 --> 03:08:34.229
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4534
03:08:34.229 --> 03:08:36.255
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4535
03:08:36.255 --> 03:08:37.959
TALIESIN: Pretty sure, yeah, I think that took,

4536
03:08:37.959 --> 03:08:40.020
really did that weirdly.

4537
03:08:40.020 --> 03:08:41.490
Then I'm just going to use a cantrip.

4538
03:08:41.490 --> 03:08:43.437
I'm going to...

4539
03:08:45.572 --> 03:08:46.638
I can Sacred Flame again.

4540
03:08:46.638 --> 03:08:50.480
MATT: Okay. Dexterity save.

4541
03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:52.146
13. I believe that's a fail.

4542
03:08:52.146 --> 03:08:54.137
Roll damage again.

4543
03:08:54.137 --> 03:08:56.920
Just cantripping it. (blasting)

4544
03:08:56.920 --> 03:08:59.649
LAURA: Come on, Caduceus!

4545
03:08:59.649 --> 03:09:02.337
TALIESIN: Blech. 14 points of radiant damage.

4546
03:09:02.337 --> 03:09:04.350
MATT: 14 points of radiant, all right.

4547
03:09:04.350 --> 03:09:06.050
Wear and tear is starting to show on this creature.

4548
03:09:06.050 --> 03:09:08.234
It's not like super hurting, but you can see now,

4549
03:09:08.234 --> 03:09:11.326
the damage is starting to add up a bit.

4550
03:09:12.450 --> 03:09:13.283
That finish your turn?

4551
03:09:13.283 --> 03:09:15.700
TALIESIN: I'm curious, is it in melee with--

4552
03:09:15.700 --> 03:09:17.150
if I try and, well.

4553
03:09:17.150 --> 03:09:18.649
MATT: You don't know.

4554
03:09:18.649 --> 03:09:21.770
It seems to be able to hit you from here.

4555
03:09:21.770 --> 03:09:23.091
TALIESIN: That can mean anything, though.

4556
03:09:23.091 --> 03:09:24.922
MATT: Yeah.

4557
03:09:24.922 --> 03:09:27.764
TRAVIS: It can whip and it can melee.

4558
03:09:27.764 --> 03:09:30.664
TALIESIN: You know, there doesn't seem to really be

4559
03:09:30.664 --> 03:09:35.189
a reason to move at the moment.

4560
03:09:35.189 --> 03:09:36.490
SAM: Why the long faces, guys?

4561
03:09:36.490 --> 03:09:37.736
TALIESIN: Fuck.

4562
03:09:37.736 --> 03:09:42.170
TRAVIS: This is great. Caleb trying kill everybody.

4563
03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:44.500
MATT: It's your bonus and your action. You can move.

4564
03:09:44.500 --> 03:09:46.010
TALIESIN: You know what? Actually, yeah,

4565
03:09:46.010 --> 03:09:49.240
because maybe it will actually, maybe it will burn

4566
03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:51.254
its reaction against me,

4567
03:09:51.254 --> 03:09:53.128
so I will try and back the fuck off. See what happens.

4568
03:09:53.128 --> 03:09:53.970
MATT: Okay.

4569
03:09:53.970 --> 03:09:56.536
TRAVIS: Come on, you goth genius.

4570
03:09:56.536 --> 03:09:58.180
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to curl around

4571
03:09:58.180 --> 03:09:59.540
to try and get some, yeah.

4572
03:09:59.540 --> 03:10:01.180
I'm getting out of there.

4573
03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:02.770
MATT: You do need to make a constitution save for your

4574
03:10:02.770 --> 03:10:05.655
Beacon of Hope, by the way.

4575
03:10:05.655 --> 03:10:07.890
SAM Beacon of Hope!

4576
03:10:07.890 --> 03:10:10.298
TALIESIN: I kind of want-- 14?

4577
03:10:10.298 --> 03:10:12.380
MATT: 14 succeeds, yeah, you still maintain it.

4578
03:10:12.380 --> 03:10:14.230
TALIESIN: That was my bonus action, too, so yeah.

4579
03:10:14.230 --> 03:10:17.060
MATT: Caduceus is done. Beauregard, you are stunned.

4580
03:10:17.060 --> 03:10:18.280
TALIESIN: I am close to going down.

4581
03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:19.870
MATT: By the end of your turn, you are no longer stunned.

4582
03:10:19.870 --> 03:10:21.760
MARISHA: I'm not stunned, right, yeah.

4583
03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:23.393
That's pretty much it, right?

4584
03:10:23.393 --> 03:10:25.410
MATT: That's your turn. Fjord, you're up.

4585
03:10:25.410 --> 03:10:27.470
You see this creature come across the way.

4586
03:10:27.470 --> 03:10:29.570
You were holding your action from last turn,

4587
03:10:29.570 --> 03:10:33.443
so before your turn happens, you do get your held action.

4588
03:10:33.443 --> 03:10:35.300
TRAVIS: That was from the previous turn.

4589
03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:37.760
I took the potion on the turn after that.

4590
03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:39.520
MATT: Potion's a bonus action.

4591
03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:41.728
TRAVIS: You're right, yep.

4592
03:10:41.728 --> 03:10:43.586
MATT: You get both.

4593
03:10:43.586 --> 03:10:45.040
It's a house rule, folks, don't worry.

4594
03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:47.773
We have a lot of players and

4595
03:10:47.773 --> 03:10:49.430
it's less fun to spend your action--

4596
03:10:49.430 --> 03:10:50.480
TRAVIS: Disadvantage, advantage, I can't remember.

4597
03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:51.313
Just straight roll, right?

4598
03:10:51.313 --> 03:10:52.560
MATT: Straight roll.

4599
03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:54.836
He does have, from your current position,

4600
03:10:54.836 --> 03:10:56.165
three-quarters cover, though, because he's near

4601
03:10:56.165 --> 03:10:56.998
the wall there.

4602
03:10:56.998 --> 03:10:57.831
TRAVIS: 18 to hit.

4603
03:10:57.831 --> 03:10:59.030
MATT: Misses.

4604
03:10:59.030 --> 03:11:01.169
LAURA: (exaggerated) Eldritch Blast!

4605
03:11:01.169 --> 03:11:02.366
TRAVIS: Oh, because of where I'm standing?

4606
03:11:02.366 --> 03:11:03.199
MATT: Because of where you're standing.

4607
03:11:03.199 --> 03:11:04.866
You're way back in the hallway and there are these.

4608
03:11:04.866 --> 03:11:06.426
LAURA and TALIESIN: You were holding your action.

4609
03:11:06.426 --> 03:11:07.850
MATT: Another one.

4610
03:11:07.850 --> 03:11:08.683
TRAVIS: 20.

4611
03:11:08.683 --> 03:11:09.531
MATT: 20 misses.

4612
03:11:09.531 --> 03:11:11.720
Both hit the stone wall across the way.

4613
03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:14.180
Unfortunately, too much of him is covered.

4614
03:11:14.180 --> 03:11:15.013
Now it's your turn.

4615
03:11:15.013 --> 03:11:17.313
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I will

4616
03:11:17.313 --> 03:11:22.079
cast Hexblade's Curse on the bull demon.

4617
03:11:22.079 --> 03:11:23.178
MATT: You can do that.

4618
03:11:23.178 --> 03:11:26.452
Hexblade's Curse upon this motherfucker.

4619
03:11:26.452 --> 03:11:31.430
TRAVIS: I will send the first Eldritch Blast at Yasha.

4620
03:11:31.430 --> 03:11:33.730
The second one at the demon.

4621
03:11:33.730 --> 03:11:37.610
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack against Yasha first.

4622
03:11:37.610 --> 03:11:39.210
TRAVIS: That's a lot.

4623
03:11:39.210 --> 03:11:44.210
That's 20, no, 30, Jesus, 31 to hit.

4624
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:48.377
19 plus 13.

4625
03:11:48.377 --> 03:11:49.218
MATT: Fuck!

4626
03:11:49.218 --> 03:11:50.127
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4627
03:11:50.127 --> 03:11:51.038
MATT: You have to double check

4628
03:11:51.038 --> 03:11:52.370
what your attack bonus is on that.

4629
03:11:52.370 --> 03:11:53.540
TRAVIS: Nope, I'm looking at the falchion, sorry.

4630
03:11:53.540 --> 03:11:56.260
Sorry, sorry, sorry. That is 27 to hit.

4631
03:11:56.260 --> 03:11:59.668
My apologies. 19 plus eight.

4632
03:11:59.668 --> 03:12:01.062
MATT: We still have to check that falchion attack bonus.

4633
03:12:01.062 --> 03:12:01.964
That seems really high.

4634
03:12:01.964 --> 03:12:03.280
TRAVIS: Oh really?

4635
03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:07.279
MATT: Anyway. That's fine.

4636
03:12:07.279 --> 03:12:09.100
TRAVIS: 1d10 plus five.

4637
03:12:09.100 --> 03:12:11.000
Seven points of Eldritch Blast damage.

4638
03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:12.622
MATT: Mark that down on her.

4639
03:12:12.622 --> 03:12:14.760
It's force damage, she's not resistant.

4640
03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:17.426
Roll another wisdom saving throw for her with advantage.

4641
03:12:17.426 --> 03:12:18.259
TRAVIS: With advantage?

4642
03:12:18.259 --> 03:12:19.092
MATT: Yes.

4643
03:12:19.092 --> 03:12:20.583
LIAM: Come on, man.

4644
03:12:20.583 --> 03:12:23.546
TRAVIS: A natural one and a six, for five.

4645
03:12:23.546 --> 03:12:25.200
MATT: She maintains the charm.

4646
03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:27.026
MARISHA: Is it like this side of the table?

4647
03:12:27.026 --> 03:12:30.065
MATT: It might be. The other attack against the creature.

4648
03:12:30.065 --> 03:12:31.506
LIAM: And I rolled really low when I was

4649
03:12:31.506 --> 03:12:32.597
trying to murder you guys.

4650
03:12:32.597 --> 03:12:33.430
MARISHA: Yeah, you did.

4651
03:12:33.430 --> 03:12:34.355
LAURA: And the what?

4652
03:12:34.355 --> 03:12:35.780
MATT: Travis, your other attack against the main creature.

4653
03:12:35.780 --> 03:12:37.288
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

4654
03:12:37.288 --> 03:12:39.024
I kind of wanted to do the second one against Yasha,

4655
03:12:39.024 --> 03:12:41.232
but I already said it. Misses.

4656
03:12:41.232 --> 03:12:43.123
MATT: Nope. No effect.

4657
03:12:43.123 --> 03:12:46.343
All right, you're staying put?

4658
03:12:46.343 --> 03:12:47.293
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4659
03:12:47.293 --> 03:12:49.820
MATT: All right. That finishes your go there.

4660
03:12:49.820 --> 03:12:51.633
Yasha's turn.

4661
03:12:51.633 --> 03:12:54.875
Yasha looks down at the Caleb she had just

4662
03:12:54.875 --> 03:12:57.782
knocked onto the ground

4663
03:12:57.782 --> 03:13:00.720
and lifts Magician's Judge above and is going to attempt

4664
03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:04.260
to strike you while there. Since I rolled this one,

4665
03:13:04.260 --> 03:13:07.350
that is 15 plus her attack bonus.

4666
03:13:07.350 --> 03:13:08.520
TRAVIS: Six.

4667
03:13:08.520 --> 03:13:09.745
MATT: 21 and that hits you.

4668
03:13:09.745 --> 03:13:11.332
LIAM: Hits.

4669
03:13:11.332 --> 03:13:13.760
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage for her first strike.

4670
03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:17.679
TALIESIN: Disadvantage for? No, never mind, sorry.

4671
03:13:17.679 --> 03:13:19.787
LAURA: That's a ranged.

4672
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:26.270
TRAVIS: Sorry, 13. 17.

4673
03:13:26.270 --> 03:13:29.170
LIAM: But I'm raging, so it's halved. I'm unconscious.

4674
03:13:29.170 --> 03:13:32.687
MATT: All right, second strike against you, as well.

4675
03:13:32.687 --> 03:13:35.480
That hits, you lose two death saving throws.

4676
03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:37.310
LIAM: It's automatic, right? Yeah.

4677
03:13:37.310 --> 03:13:42.250
MATT: She's going to charge past and will go after Caduceus.

4678
03:13:42.250 --> 03:13:45.230
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

4679
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:49.510
MATT: Gets up into melee with him.

4680
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:50.343
All righty.

4681
03:13:50.343 --> 03:13:51.690
LIAM: Interesting.

4682
03:13:51.690 --> 03:13:52.831
SAM: "Interesting"?!

4683
03:13:52.831 --> 03:13:56.498
MATT: That finishes Yasha's go. Nott, you're up.

4684
03:13:58.100 --> 03:14:02.833
SAM: I'm going to run around the corner to attack.

4685
03:14:02.833 --> 03:14:05.540
Keep going.

4686
03:14:05.540 --> 03:14:07.170
MATT: One, two.

4687
03:14:07.170 --> 03:14:10.380
20, 30, 35 to get you up in there.

4688
03:14:10.380 --> 03:14:14.980
SAM: All right, upon running around and seeing my friend,

4689
03:14:14.980 --> 03:14:19.980
Caleb Widogast-- real name-- on the floor.

4690
03:14:20.455 --> 03:14:23.037
How far am I from Caleb Widogast?

4691
03:14:23.037 --> 03:14:28.037
MATT: You are probably in the range of 35 feet.

4692
03:14:28.178 --> 03:14:30.553
SAM: That's my movement.

4693
03:14:30.553 --> 03:14:33.886
I will bonus action dash

4694
03:14:33.886 --> 03:14:37.194
to Caleb Widogast.

4695
03:14:38.940 --> 03:14:43.098
MATT: Movement from where he is is further from

4696
03:14:43.098 --> 03:14:44.660
there's a difference between distance

4697
03:14:44.660 --> 03:14:46.150
and how to get to them, because there are

4698
03:14:46.150 --> 03:14:47.902
things in your way.

4699
03:14:47.902 --> 03:14:49.330
That's rough terrain and stuff like that.

4700
03:14:49.330 --> 03:14:52.480
In order to get to him, I'm just letting you know.

4701
03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:54.360
But if that's what you're doing, going for it,

4702
03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:55.193
giving it a shot.

4703
03:14:55.193 --> 03:14:56.568
SAM: I'm trying to get there.

4704
03:14:56.568 --> 03:15:00.960
Do I have to flip over shit to get to him?

4705
03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:03.325
SAM: I'll say yeah. Make an acrobatics check for me.

4706
03:15:03.325 --> 03:15:05.775
It's going to be a relatively high DC.

4707
03:15:05.775 --> 03:15:08.767
SAM: 19, naturally.

4708
03:15:08.767 --> 03:15:10.980
Plus eight, 27.

4709
03:15:10.980 --> 03:15:11.813
MATT: I'll allow it.

4710
03:15:11.813 --> 03:15:14.300
Instead of having to zig-zag around.

4711
03:15:14.300 --> 03:15:19.278
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

4712
03:15:19.278 --> 03:15:21.570
TRAVIS: Caleb!

4713
03:15:21.570 --> 03:15:22.694
LAURA: My boy!

4714
03:15:22.694 --> 03:15:27.180
SAM: I'll pop the potion I stole from your teacher

4715
03:15:27.180 --> 03:15:31.063
and dunk it down your throat.

4716
03:15:31.063 --> 03:15:33.053
TALIESIN: Beacon of Hope is still active.

4717
03:15:33.053 --> 03:15:34.394
LAURA: So that's max.

4718
03:15:34.394 --> 03:15:35.910
SAM: 4d4 plus four?

4719
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:39.015
LIAM: 16 plus, yeah, 20.

4720
03:15:39.015 --> 03:15:40.019
SAM: What do you think?

4721
03:15:40.019 --> 03:15:43.330
MATT: I'm trying to think.
SAM: You tell me.

4722
03:15:43.330 --> 03:15:45.220
MATT: Yeah, I'll say you're still under the effect

4723
03:15:45.220 --> 03:15:46.053
of Beacon of Hope.

4724
03:15:46.053 --> 03:15:48.955
TALIESIN: It doesn't go down when you go unconscious.

4725
03:15:48.955 --> 03:15:50.422
SAM: I was never under Beacon of Hope.

4726
03:15:50.422 --> 03:15:51.529
MATT: No, I know you were not.

4727
03:15:51.529 --> 03:15:52.744
LIAM: It's me. I was.

4728
03:15:52.744 --> 03:15:54.069
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Pass that over, please.

4729
03:15:54.069 --> 03:15:55.085
SAM: Yeah.

4730
03:15:55.085 --> 03:15:56.880
LAURA: Oh my god, all of our--

4731
03:15:56.880 --> 03:15:58.990
MARISHA: So many, we burned through a lot.

4732
03:15:58.990 --> 03:16:01.298
TRAVIS: How many on the table still, one? Two.

4733
03:16:01.298 --> 03:16:04.723
LAURA: Three. We have three on the table.

4734
03:16:04.723 --> 03:16:07.064
MATT: That finishes your turn, Nott.

4735
03:16:07.064 --> 03:16:08.105
SAM: That's it.

4736
03:16:08.105 --> 03:16:09.629
LIAM: (groaning)

4737
03:16:09.629 --> 03:16:13.508
MATT: Jester. Your turn.

4738
03:16:13.508 --> 03:16:15.075
LAURA: Oh my god.

4739
03:16:15.075 --> 03:16:16.664
TALIESIN: Hit that motherfucker up there.

4740
03:16:16.664 --> 03:16:17.520
LAURA: Yeah?

4741
03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:18.628
TALIESIN: Yeah [inaudible].

4742
03:16:19.872 --> 03:16:22.392
SAM: What are you guys--?

4743
03:16:23.885 --> 03:16:26.002
TALIESIN: What are you going to do?

4744
03:16:26.002 --> 03:16:29.160
I've got plans. They're shitty plans, but I got plans.

4745
03:16:29.160 --> 03:16:31.830
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4746
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:36.371
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon

4747
03:16:36.371 --> 03:16:38.021
as a bonus action.

4748
03:16:38.021 --> 03:16:39.262
MATT: Okay.

4749
03:16:39.262 --> 03:16:41.440
LAURA: Right above him.

4750
03:16:41.440 --> 03:16:45.480
I have to do it at 3rd-level because that's all I got left.

4751
03:16:45.480 --> 03:16:48.950
MATT: Spiritual weapon appears. 3rd-level.

4752
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:50.469
Right above him.

4753
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:51.932
LAURA: He's going to attack his head.

4754
03:16:51.932 --> 03:16:53.890
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

4755
03:16:53.890 --> 03:16:57.432
LAURA: Doesn't hit him!

4756
03:16:57.432 --> 03:16:59.388
MATT: (clanging) Just like sparks.

4757
03:16:59.388 --> 03:17:02.730
All these heavy, divine sparks fly off as it strikes

4758
03:17:02.730 --> 03:17:05.230
the outside of the hardened demon hide to no effect.

4759
03:17:05.230 --> 03:17:09.680
LAURA: I'm going to try to Toll the Dead on him, as well.

4760
03:17:09.680 --> 03:17:12.971
MATT: All righty. Is that a constitution save?

4761
03:17:12.971 --> 03:17:14.679
LAURA: It's a wisdom save.

4762
03:17:14.679 --> 03:17:16.940
MATT: I keep forgetting that. That is a 17.

4763
03:17:16.940 --> 03:17:19.460
LAURA: Motherfucker, you always resist my--

4764
03:17:19.460 --> 03:17:21.480
MATT: I'm so sorry, this was a natural 16.

4765
03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:24.520
LAURA: Every fucking time! That's okay.

4766
03:17:24.520 --> 03:17:29.245
Ah! Didn't work. I'm going to--

4767
03:17:33.001 --> 03:17:35.960
Oh no, you know what I should have done?

4768
03:17:35.960 --> 03:17:37.260
SAM: Rewind.

4769
03:17:37.260 --> 03:17:38.543
MATT: Too late now.

4770
03:17:38.543 --> 03:17:42.000
LAURA: I forgot Yasha's still affected.

4771
03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:46.460
That's okay, I'm going to just, you know, run.

4772
03:17:46.460 --> 03:17:49.620
I'm going to run around. Can I run around him?

4773
03:17:49.620 --> 03:17:51.930
Try it like, no against the wall, under

4774
03:17:51.930 --> 03:17:55.330
my spiritual weapon, and get next to Caleb

4775
03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:57.180
and just stand over him?

4776
03:17:57.180 --> 03:17:59.663
MATT: Yep. You are now looming over Caleb, who's now coming

4777
03:17:59.663 --> 03:18:02.080
out of consciousness a couple times.

4778
03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:04.553
You're just looking up at Jester running over.

4779
03:18:04.553 --> 03:18:08.523
LAURA: You'll feel better soon, after we're all dead.

4780
03:18:08.523 --> 03:18:11.120
LIAM: (groaning)

4781
03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:13.900
TRAVIS: Yep, yep, yep.

4782
03:18:15.130 --> 03:18:17.428
MATT: End of--

4783
03:18:17.428 --> 03:18:19.830
LIAM: Jester and Caleb tied for initiative.

4784
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:21.740
Do I come right after her?

4785
03:18:21.740 --> 03:18:23.448
MATT: No, you didn't.

4786
03:18:23.448 --> 03:18:25.589
LIAM: Oh, I thought I did. That was the past

4787
03:18:25.589 --> 03:18:27.112
initiative roll.

4788
03:18:27.112 --> 03:18:29.086
TALIESIN: This is the terrible future.

4789
03:18:29.086 --> 03:18:31.610
This is the grim meathook future.

4790
03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:33.750
MATT: That's correct.

4791
03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:36.791
He used his held action. He's going to fly over here

4792
03:18:36.791 --> 03:18:39.133
and just watch what's transpiring on this end.

4793
03:18:39.133 --> 03:18:40.974
LAURA: Fuck that guy.

4794
03:18:40.974 --> 03:18:42.965
SAM: No one has a spell?

4795
03:18:42.965 --> 03:18:45.235
that can change the existence?

4796
03:18:45.235 --> 03:18:48.340
TRAVIS: Don't look at this two-slot warlock, I'm out.

4797
03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:50.171
MARISHA: Two-slot warlock!

4798
03:18:50.171 --> 03:18:52.240
SAM: You just drank a potion; you're back in!

4799
03:18:52.240 --> 03:18:53.298
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4800
03:18:53.298 --> 03:18:55.075
SAM: Get in the fight, you weakling.

4801
03:18:55.075 --> 03:18:56.760
TRAVIS: I'm in it.

4802
03:18:56.760 --> 03:19:01.060
MATT: It's going to go ahead and since you are prone,

4803
03:19:01.060 --> 03:19:02.742
it wants to put you down.

4804
03:19:02.742 --> 03:19:05.220
It's like, "Fucking stay down."

4805
03:19:05.220 --> 03:19:06.595
LAURA: I'm not protecting him?

4806
03:19:06.595 --> 03:19:08.214
MATT: It's a natural 20.

4807
03:19:08.214 --> 03:19:09.860
TALIESIN: How far away am I from him?

4808
03:19:09.860 --> 03:19:11.109
LIAM: Why even roll?

4809
03:19:11.109 --> 03:19:13.693
MATT: We'll see. If I roll really shitty.

4810
03:19:13.693 --> 03:19:17.459
No, that's 26 points damage.

4811
03:19:17.459 --> 03:19:20.732
TALIESIN: How far away from?

4812
03:19:20.732 --> 03:19:22.190
SAM: No!

4813
03:19:23.334 --> 03:19:25.281
LIAM: Three times.

4814
03:19:25.281 --> 03:19:26.680
MATT: 25 feet.
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

4815
03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:28.969
Let me double check.

4816
03:19:28.969 --> 03:19:30.827
TRAVIS: What the?

4817
03:19:30.827 --> 03:19:31.952
MARISHA: This one's got a corkscrew.

4818
03:19:31.952 --> 03:19:35.811
MATT: That's the first attack. Actually.

4819
03:19:35.811 --> 03:19:38.452
TRAVIS: What, what?

4820
03:19:38.452 --> 03:19:39.870
MATT: It's too late, I already decreed.

4821
03:19:39.870 --> 03:19:42.670
It does get its lance back, but it didn't use this turn.

4822
03:19:45.254 --> 03:19:50.241
It's now going to attack Nott, actually.

4823
03:19:55.570 --> 03:19:58.210
MARISHA: This is the soundtrack to us going to hell.

4824
03:19:58.210 --> 03:20:00.990
MATT: No, it's going to attack Jester.

4825
03:20:00.990 --> 03:20:03.213
Because you're the one that's been striking.

4826
03:20:03.213 --> 03:20:04.839
SAM: Right under the wing over there.

4827
03:20:04.839 --> 03:20:06.501
MATT: It barely notices you, Nott.

4828
03:20:06.501 --> 03:20:08.001
SAM: Of course.

4829
03:20:08.001 --> 03:20:11.752
MATT: That's going to be 21 to hit.

4830
03:20:11.752 --> 03:20:12.585
LAURA: I guess that hits.

4831
03:20:12.585 --> 03:20:14.335
MATT: Okay.

4832
03:20:14.335 --> 03:20:18.230
You take 18 points of lightning damage.

4833
03:20:19.220 --> 03:20:23.121
It strikes across your chest with one heavy swipe.

4834
03:20:23.121 --> 03:20:24.240
LAURA: Ow.

4835
03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:27.324
MATT: Then it's going to attempt another one against you.

4836
03:20:27.324 --> 03:20:29.807
That's going to be 23 to hit.

4837
03:20:29.807 --> 03:20:31.700
LAURA: (pained) Yeah.

4838
03:20:31.700 --> 03:20:36.289
MATT: This strikes you for 14 points of lightning damage.

4839
03:20:36.289 --> 03:20:37.497
LAURA: Ugh!

4840
03:20:37.497 --> 03:20:39.218
SAM: Still alive.

4841
03:20:39.218 --> 03:20:40.414
MARISHA: Still up?

4842
03:20:40.414 --> 03:20:43.155
MATT: (growling)

4843
03:20:43.155 --> 03:20:45.290
LAURA: Ow.

4844
03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:46.890
MATT: That's going to end its turn.

4845
03:20:46.890 --> 03:20:48.615
Caleb, death saving throw.

4846
03:20:48.615 --> 03:20:49.589
LIAM: Yeah. At advantage.

4847
03:20:49.589 --> 03:20:50.878
SAM: We're at it again.

4848
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:55.537
LIAM: Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in.

4849
03:20:55.537 --> 03:20:56.370
Success.

4850
03:20:56.370 --> 03:20:58.428
MATT: All right. That's one success for you. Good.

4851
03:20:58.428 --> 03:20:59.686
LIAM: Things are looking up, guys!

4852
03:20:59.686 --> 03:21:00.900
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

4853
03:21:00.900 --> 03:21:02.530
TALIESIN: Fudge, man.

4854
03:21:02.530 --> 03:21:05.782
(laughter)

4855
03:21:05.782 --> 03:21:06.650
TRAVIS: The goth with the Fright Night t-shirt

4856
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:10.510
looks up and says, "Fudge, man."

4857
03:21:10.510 --> 03:21:14.604
TALIESIN: Yeah, well.

4858
03:21:14.604 --> 03:21:16.379
SAM: Come on.

4859
03:21:16.379 --> 03:21:17.370
TALIESIN: Sorry, guys.

4860
03:21:17.370 --> 03:21:19.070
TRAVIS: What are you saying sorry for, man?

4861
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:20.545
We're all sucking.

4862
03:21:23.060 --> 03:21:25.380
I don't have shit. I'm throwing green stuff out of my hands,

4863
03:21:25.380 --> 03:21:26.562
that's all I got.

4864
03:21:26.562 --> 03:21:28.334
MATT: Beau's up next.

4865
03:21:28.334 --> 03:21:30.900
MARISHA: Cad, you go.

4866
03:21:30.900 --> 03:21:33.146
I know what I'm going to do: I'm going to punch things.

4867
03:21:33.146 --> 03:21:33.979
TALIESIN: Sorry, sorry.

4868
03:21:33.979 --> 03:21:35.739
I had a plan and then I was immediately,

4869
03:21:35.739 --> 03:21:38.335
my plan fell apart the moment I read the spell.

4870
03:21:38.335 --> 03:21:41.535
TRAVIS: A lot of that today.

4871
03:21:41.535 --> 03:21:43.301
LAURA: (unhappy noise)

4872
03:21:43.301 --> 03:21:44.343
LIAM: Like, goddamn.

4873
03:21:44.343 --> 03:21:49.343
TALIESIN: Okay, motherfucker, motherfucker.

4874
03:21:49.970 --> 03:21:51.928
Sorry, I'm doing.

4875
03:21:51.928 --> 03:21:55.519
MATT: It's not looking great.

4876
03:21:55.519 --> 03:21:57.150
TRAVIS: We're doing awesome, you guys.

4877
03:21:57.150 --> 03:22:00.080
MATT: But it's not looking dire, either.

4878
03:22:00.080 --> 03:22:03.948
It's definitely-- I am very curious.

4879
03:22:03.948 --> 03:22:06.331
LIAM: It's pretty bad.

4880
03:22:06.331 --> 03:22:08.014
TRAVIS: We're great.

4881
03:22:08.014 --> 03:22:09.205
MARISHA: Should we try and move out?

4882
03:22:09.205 --> 03:22:10.713
Can anyone collapse a tunnel?

4883
03:22:10.713 --> 03:22:12.160
SAM: What, no!

4884
03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:13.700
We'd have to run by that thing.

4885
03:22:13.700 --> 03:22:14.818
It's going to kill us all.

4886
03:22:14.818 --> 03:22:16.806
TRAVIS: Yasha, Caduceus, and Nott.

4887
03:22:16.806 --> 03:22:19.815
SAM: Yasha isn't even on our team!

4888
03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:24.660
TALIESIN: Fuck it, I'm going to try something dumb.

4889
03:22:24.660 --> 03:22:28.836
I'm going to cast Command on Yasha.

4890
03:22:28.836 --> 03:22:30.749
LAURA That's good.

4891
03:22:30.749 --> 03:22:31.700
MATT: What are you telling her to do?

4892
03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:33.802
TALIESIN: Flee.

4893
03:22:33.802 --> 03:22:37.240
MATT: Okay. Yasha has to make a wisdom saving throw, right?

4894
03:22:37.240 --> 03:22:40.008
With advantage.

4895
03:22:40.008 --> 03:22:41.870
TRAVIS: Let's get some different ones.

4896
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:43.620
TALIESIN: No, you want to fail this.

4897
03:22:43.620 --> 03:22:45.310
You want to fail it.

4898
03:22:45.310 --> 03:22:48.770
TRAVIS: I was going to Gil in here, but.

4899
03:22:48.770 --> 03:22:51.436
MARISHA: (sarcastic laughter)

4900
03:22:51.436 --> 03:22:52.269
TRAVIS: That's a 16.

4901
03:22:52.269 --> 03:22:53.952
MARISHA: Why?!

4902
03:22:53.952 --> 03:22:55.618
TALIESIN: 16 is the--

4903
03:22:55.618 --> 03:22:56.932
TRAVIS: Natural 19 and a natural 17.

4904
03:22:56.932 --> 03:22:59.470
MATT: It seems the will of this remaining incubus

4905
03:22:59.470 --> 03:23:01.090
is too strong and the spell effect does not

4906
03:23:01.090 --> 03:23:03.960
tether itself to her brain.

4907
03:23:03.960 --> 03:23:06.260
She's coming for you, Caduceus.

4908
03:23:06.260 --> 03:23:07.810
TALIESIN: I'm okay.

4909
03:23:07.810 --> 03:23:09.500
Fudge, what am I going to do?

4910
03:23:09.500 --> 03:23:10.712
MATT: That was your action.

4911
03:23:10.712 --> 03:23:13.967
You have your bonus and you have your movement still.

4912
03:23:13.967 --> 03:23:17.487
SAM: Do something for our young Caleb.

4913
03:23:19.320 --> 03:23:21.663
TALIESIN: Fuck, man. I'm going to--

4914
03:23:21.663 --> 03:23:25.964
MARISHA: I didn't deliberately hit you the first time.

4915
03:23:25.964 --> 03:23:29.170
TALIESIN: Fuck, I am so sorry. I am having a moment.

4916
03:23:29.170 --> 03:23:32.210
TRAVIS: Take your moment!

4917
03:23:32.210 --> 03:23:35.152
MARISHA: Can we all have a moment?

4918
03:23:35.152 --> 03:23:36.410
MATT: Quickly, Caduceus.

4919
03:23:36.410 --> 03:23:40.101
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast--

4920
03:23:40.101 --> 03:23:41.917
fuck, it's the best idea I have.

4921
03:23:41.917 --> 03:23:44.990
I'm going to cast Resistance on Yasha.

4922
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:46.841
MATT: Is that an action or a bonus action?

4923
03:23:46.841 --> 03:23:47.840
TALIESIN: It's a cantrip, oh, shit, nevermind,

4924
03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:50.151
it's a fucking action, yep, I can't do that.

4925
03:23:50.151 --> 03:23:52.600
Fuck, I have so little I can do.

4926
03:23:52.600 --> 03:23:53.910
MATT: Movement, bonus, time's clicking.

4927
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:55.010
TALIESIN: I know, I'm so sorry.

4928
03:23:55.010 --> 03:23:56.526
MATT: Give you ten seconds.

4929
03:23:56.526 --> 03:24:01.485
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to cast-- fudgsicle.

4930
03:24:04.618 --> 03:24:09.425
I'm going to fucking run-- no.

4931
03:24:11.131 --> 03:24:12.340
Yeah.

4932
03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:14.759
MATT: Yeah, you're running this way.

4933
03:24:14.759 --> 03:24:16.697
Yasha makes an attack, reckless against Caduceus.

4934
03:24:16.697 --> 03:24:18.930
TRAVIS: Reckless?
MATT: Yes.

4935
03:24:18.930 --> 03:24:21.070
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

4936
03:24:21.070 --> 03:24:22.678
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a 23 to hit.

4937
03:24:22.678 --> 03:24:24.840
LAURA: Why is she rolling so well when it's against us?

4938
03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:27.290
MATT: You do not pull away because Sentinel.

4939
03:24:27.290 --> 03:24:29.113
TRAVIS: Oh, but I'm also close enough, okay, fuck,

4940
03:24:29.113 --> 03:24:30.650
it hits though, goddamn it.

4941
03:24:30.650 --> 03:24:32.816
TRAVIS: I don't think it gets the divine, right?

4942
03:24:32.816 --> 03:24:36.065
MATT: No, it does not. It does not get the divine.

4943
03:24:36.065 --> 03:24:39.219
TALIESIN: Roll low.

4944
03:24:39.219 --> 03:24:42.869
TRAVIS: (counting) 16 points of slashing.

4945
03:24:42.869 --> 03:24:45.234
MATT: 16 points of slashing damage.

4946
03:24:45.234 --> 03:24:46.350
I would say roll a concentration check,

4947
03:24:46.350 --> 03:24:49.427
but she used Magician's Judge to dispel your Beacon of Hope.

4948
03:24:49.427 --> 03:24:53.934
The sword glows, shattering the divine cord

4949
03:24:53.934 --> 03:24:55.880
that's been tethered around him this whole battle.

4950
03:24:55.880 --> 03:24:58.138
Shatter.

4951
03:24:58.138 --> 03:24:59.360
All right.

4952
03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:01.328
TRAVIS and MATT: Beacon of Hope is gone.

4953
03:25:01.328 --> 03:25:03.628
SAM: We can't run: Caleb's unconscious,

4954
03:25:03.628 --> 03:25:05.390
Yasha is not with us.

4955
03:25:05.390 --> 03:25:06.223
MATT: Beau, you're up.

4956
03:25:06.223 --> 03:25:07.298
TALIESIN: I'm fucked.

4957
03:25:07.298 --> 03:25:11.470
TRAVIS: We all are.

4958
03:25:11.470 --> 03:25:13.430
Yeah, ride or die, we're doing it.

4959
03:25:13.430 --> 03:25:15.600
We're in it now, everybody's in it.

4960
03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:18.358
SAM: Henry David Thoreau-regard.

4961
03:25:18.358 --> 03:25:20.741
(laughter)

4962
03:25:20.741 --> 03:25:22.260
TRAVIS: Don't roll any dice.

4963
03:25:22.260 --> 03:25:23.570
You got to count to 20.

4964
03:25:23.570 --> 03:25:27.526
MATT: Beau, what you doing? Fjord, you're on deck.

4965
03:25:27.526 --> 03:25:30.351
TRAVIS: You're a fucking asshole.

4966
03:25:30.351 --> 03:25:33.899
That was a complex web you've just woven.

4967
03:25:33.899 --> 03:25:35.744
LIAM: You dare bring Walden into this?

4968
03:25:35.744 --> 03:25:38.110
TALIESIN: Do I have my bonus action, too?

4969
03:25:38.110 --> 03:25:39.200
MATT: No, but you ran out of time.

4970
03:25:39.200 --> 03:25:40.033
TALIESIN: Fuck, yeah, I know.

4971
03:25:40.033 --> 03:25:41.141
MATT: What would you have used?

4972
03:25:41.141 --> 03:25:42.795
TALIESIN: I would have downed my healing potion

4973
03:25:42.795 --> 03:25:44.020
in a desperate attempt to--

4974
03:25:44.020 --> 03:25:45.220
MATT: Sure, I'll allow it, why not?

4975
03:25:45.220 --> 03:25:46.960
It's quick enough, it's fine.

4976
03:25:46.960 --> 03:25:48.848
TRAVIS: I'll allow it, it won't matter.

4977
03:25:48.848 --> 03:25:50.537
TALIESIN: No, it's really not.

4978
03:25:50.537 --> 03:25:52.130
MARISHA: I beat the shit out of him

4979
03:25:52.130 --> 03:25:54.424
or I run and abandon all of you all.

4980
03:25:54.424 --> 03:25:57.498
Can I get to him?

4981
03:25:57.498 --> 03:25:58.650
MATT: What'd you roll?

4982
03:25:58.650 --> 03:26:00.570
TALIESIN: Oh, it would have been before Beacon of Hope,

4983
03:26:00.570 --> 03:26:03.635
but I can roll it if you like.

4984
03:26:03.635 --> 03:26:06.572
MATT: I'll say no, it would have been at the end of your--

4985
03:26:06.572 --> 03:26:09.655
TALIESIN: It's two plus, come on. Seven, all right.

4986
03:26:09.655 --> 03:26:12.313
MATT: Seven damage. Not too bad.

4987
03:26:12.313 --> 03:26:14.363
What are you doing, Beau? Running out of time.

4988
03:26:14.363 --> 03:26:16.129
MARISHA: I asked if I could get to him.

4989
03:26:16.129 --> 03:26:18.528
MATT: Oh yeah, you can get to him, no problem.

4990
03:26:18.528 --> 03:26:19.868
MARISHA: Didn't know how crowded it was.

4991
03:26:19.868 --> 03:26:21.590
MATT: You can move around.

4992
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:23.660
Parkouring off the side,

4993
03:26:23.660 --> 03:26:25.335
you can get on this end.

4994
03:26:25.335 --> 03:26:27.084
MARISHA: These are just straight rolls, right?

4995
03:26:27.084 --> 03:26:28.710
LIAM: You've got a flanking going with Nott?

4996
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:30.758
MATT: You do have a flank with Nott.

4997
03:26:30.758 --> 03:26:31.696
MARISHA: I do have a flank with Nott.

4998
03:26:31.696 --> 03:26:34.166
SAM: Correct. Let's do this.

4999
03:26:34.166 --> 03:26:34.999
MARISHA: All right.

5000
03:26:34.999 --> 03:26:39.610
God, dice gods, please, please, dice gods.

5001
03:26:39.610 --> 03:26:41.250
LIAM: You can punch me in the jaw, if it will help.

5002
03:26:41.250 --> 03:26:43.475
MARISHA: Traveler be with us! Natural 20.

5003
03:26:43.475 --> 03:26:47.771
LAURA: (yelling) Traveler loves you!

5004
03:26:47.771 --> 03:26:49.292
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

5005
03:26:49.292 --> 03:26:50.750
MARISHA: Please roll anything other than one because that's

5006
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:52.630
the story tonight.

5007
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:55.870
That's still the story, that's still the story.

5008
03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:58.070
MATT: That's four plus?

5009
03:26:58.070 --> 03:27:00.285
MARISHA: Plus eight, so 12.

5010
03:27:00.285 --> 03:27:01.243
MATT: Four plus eight?

5011
03:27:01.243 --> 03:27:03.310
MARISHA: 12, right? Four plus eight is 12?

5012
03:27:03.310 --> 03:27:06.585
MATT: Plus eight damage from?

5013
03:27:06.585 --> 03:27:08.330
MARISHA: No, sorry, five, plus five.

5014
03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:09.390
Eight is my attack bonus.

5015
03:27:09.390 --> 03:27:14.273
Yeah, so nine-- no. Yes. Nine points of damage. Next one.

5016
03:27:14.273 --> 03:27:17.834
MATT: I know. It's all good.

5017
03:27:17.834 --> 03:27:19.200
MARISHA: Okay, that's a natural 17.

5018
03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:20.311
MATT: That's a hit.

5019
03:27:20.311 --> 03:27:21.927
MARISHA: Eight damage.

5020
03:27:21.927 --> 03:27:24.386
MATT: Eight points of damage, nice.

5021
03:27:24.386 --> 03:27:26.193
This barrage of pummeling, that's your attack-attack.

5022
03:27:26.193 --> 03:27:27.900
You have your bonus action.

5023
03:27:27.900 --> 03:27:30.330
MARISHA: Which I can use to do one offhanded hit, right?

5024
03:27:30.330 --> 03:27:31.896
MATT: You can, yeah,

5025
03:27:31.896 --> 03:27:32.938
since you don't have any more ki points.

5026
03:27:32.938 --> 03:27:36.225
MARISHA: Might as well. No more ki points.

5027
03:27:36.225 --> 03:27:37.580
LIAM and MATT: That one is cocked, yeah.

5028
03:27:37.580 --> 03:27:38.655
MARISHA: One's a 15, though.

5029
03:27:38.655 --> 03:27:40.229
MATT: Yeah, you hit, you're fine. Roll damage.

5030
03:27:40.229 --> 03:27:44.346
MARISHA: It's a 13. Why am I rolling great now?

5031
03:27:44.346 --> 03:27:46.010
Oh, that's sucky, seven.

5032
03:27:46.010 --> 03:27:47.920
MATT: Seven points of damage, all righty.

5033
03:27:47.920 --> 03:27:49.860
Whack, whack, whack, you're just pummeling

5034
03:27:49.860 --> 03:27:53.450
this creature. It's starting to look hurt.

5035
03:27:53.450 --> 03:27:55.020
It's angry.

5036
03:27:55.020 --> 03:27:59.170
MARISHA: All of my might, just fucking tears coming

5037
03:27:59.170 --> 03:28:01.080
out of the corner of Beau's eyes.

5038
03:28:01.080 --> 03:28:04.018
MATT: No worries. Fjord, your turn.

5039
03:28:04.018 --> 03:28:05.830
TRAVIS: Yeah, Fjord will-- fuck it, we're all going down.

5040
03:28:05.830 --> 03:28:08.720
He'll run in and using the Hexblade's Curse,

5041
03:28:08.720 --> 03:28:10.919
he will hope for a 19 or a 20.

5042
03:28:10.919 --> 03:28:14.270
Right there, just so I can see him fully, yeah.

5043
03:28:14.270 --> 03:28:17.603
MATT: Does not get any bonus to its armor class. Go for it.

5044
03:28:17.603 --> 03:28:21.618
TRAVIS: Okay. Eldritch Blast, both of them. First one.

5045
03:28:21.618 --> 03:28:23.970
LIAM: I have a slot, but I'm unconscious.

5046
03:28:23.970 --> 03:28:25.880
TRAVIS: Fuck, 11.

5047
03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:27.010
MATT: 11 misses.

5048
03:28:27.010 --> 03:28:30.640
Or it impacts, but ricochets off, the eldritch power

5049
03:28:30.640 --> 03:28:35.220
not able to pierce its hide. Second attack.

5050
03:28:35.220 --> 03:28:36.120
TRAVIS: 25.

5051
03:28:36.120 --> 03:28:40.203
MATT: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

5052
03:28:42.669 --> 03:28:46.233
TRAVIS: Really?! A one?!

5053
03:28:46.233 --> 03:28:47.291
MATT: Oh, buddy.

5054
03:28:47.291 --> 03:28:48.124
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

5055
03:28:48.124 --> 03:28:49.840
LIAM: This is a war of attrition.

5056
03:28:49.840 --> 03:28:51.480
TRAVIS: Nine points of eldritch damage.

5057
03:28:51.480 --> 03:28:55.180
MATT: Nine points of force damage to the creature.

5058
03:28:55.180 --> 03:28:57.780
The blast hits it, the other one just dissipates off of it.

5059
03:28:57.780 --> 03:28:59.760
It seems to be looking around at these ants

5060
03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:01.800
that are harrying it from side to side.

5061
03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:04.830
It shows far more confidence than you do, right now.

5062
03:29:04.830 --> 03:29:05.663
That ends your turn?

5063
03:29:05.663 --> 03:29:06.629
TRAVIS: It does.

5064
03:29:06.629 --> 03:29:09.510
MATT: Finishing Fjord's go, it is Yasha's.

5065
03:29:09.510 --> 03:29:11.735
Yasha is going to recklessly attack Caduceus

5066
03:29:11.735 --> 03:29:14.430
with both strikes.

5067
03:29:14.430 --> 03:29:18.113
MATT: First one. 20.

5068
03:29:18.113 --> 03:29:19.230
TALIESIN: Oh fuck, man.

5069
03:29:19.230 --> 03:29:23.030
MATT: All right, roll damage. The full first strike.

5070
03:29:25.430 --> 03:29:26.480
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

5071
03:29:26.480 --> 03:29:29.715
MATT: Oh, now all the damage rolls come through.

5072
03:29:29.715 --> 03:29:31.373
TRAVIS: That's three sixes, Jesus Christ.

5073
03:29:31.373 --> 03:29:33.450
MATT: Oh, fuck!

5074
03:29:33.450 --> 03:29:36.257
TRAVIS: 12, 18. Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm out.

5075
03:29:36.257 --> 03:29:37.573
MARISHA: I need to take a walk for a minute.

5076
03:29:37.573 --> 03:29:38.705
MATT: Caduceus, you're out?

5077
03:29:38.705 --> 03:29:39.580
TALIESIN: I'm out.

5078
03:29:39.580 --> 03:29:43.920
MATT: Second strike hits you. It's auto hit if it's melee.

5079
03:29:43.920 --> 03:29:45.660
You lose two death saves.

5080
03:29:45.660 --> 03:29:49.020
SAM: Oh, fuck.

5081
03:29:49.020 --> 03:29:51.960
Oh fuck, you don't have anything?

5082
03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:54.920
TALIESIN: I do, but it's not great, but I do.

5083
03:29:54.920 --> 03:29:56.345
SAM: You do?!

5084
03:29:56.345 --> 03:29:57.419
MARISHA: You're unconscious?

5085
03:29:57.419 --> 03:30:00.970
TALIESIN: Once it's my turn, I believe, I auto-stabilize.

5086
03:30:00.970 --> 03:30:02.030
MATT: Is that part of your thing?

5087
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:03.400
TALIESIN: Hold on, I'll figure it out.

5088
03:30:03.400 --> 03:30:05.090
SAM: That's amazing if that's true.

5089
03:30:05.090 --> 03:30:06.098
LAURA: Yeah, that's huge.

5090
03:30:06.098 --> 03:30:07.622
TRAVIS: That's a long way away.

5091
03:30:07.622 --> 03:30:10.345
MATT: Yasha's going to move this way

5092
03:30:10.345 --> 03:30:14.320
and engage with Beauregard.

5093
03:30:14.320 --> 03:30:17.287
That finishes Yasha's turn. Nott, you're up.

5094
03:30:17.287 --> 03:30:18.790
SAM: Oh my god.

5095
03:30:18.790 --> 03:30:21.780
MATT: You just watched Caduceus just (poof) in the distance

5096
03:30:21.780 --> 03:30:23.330
as Yasha strikes through twice.

5097
03:30:23.330 --> 03:30:27.650
SAM: Everything is bad.

5098
03:30:27.650 --> 03:30:31.200
I will try to move over Caleb as some sort

5099
03:30:31.200 --> 03:30:34.330
of a goblin shield, holding up my hand saying:

5100
03:30:34.330 --> 03:30:36.370
Please, spare him.

5101
03:30:36.370 --> 03:30:38.590
Behind my hand, I will stick out my crossbow

5102
03:30:38.590 --> 03:30:40.281
and shoot him in the face.

5103
03:30:40.281 --> 03:30:41.189
MATT: Go for it.

5104
03:30:41.189 --> 03:30:42.497
LAURA: Natural 20!

5105
03:30:42.497 --> 03:30:45.093
SAM: Not great, only a 16.

5106
03:30:45.093 --> 03:30:47.867
MATT: 16 does not hit.

5107
03:30:47.867 --> 03:30:51.125
SAM: Okay. Bonus action shoot again.

5108
03:30:51.125 --> 03:30:52.970
Even worse!

5109
03:30:52.970 --> 03:30:56.635
MATT: Both strikes just ricocheting off his body.

5110
03:30:56.635 --> 03:30:59.127
TRAVIS: What's happening?

5111
03:30:59.127 --> 03:31:00.580
MATT: Telepathic words pierce your mind

5112
03:31:00.580 --> 03:31:02.570
as it notices your blows striking off its face

5113
03:31:02.570 --> 03:31:04.980
and you just hear the essence of a voice,

5114
03:31:04.980 --> 03:31:08.875
no language, just intent going, "Keep trying.

5115
03:31:08.875 --> 03:31:12.100
"I'll eat your face next."

5116
03:31:12.100 --> 03:31:16.660
SAM: I'm going to still use the rest of my movement to

5117
03:31:16.660 --> 03:31:20.570
get off of Caleb and while not leaving melee,

5118
03:31:20.570 --> 03:31:23.820
just go all the way around, beside Beau.

5119
03:31:23.820 --> 03:31:25.510
MATT: To there, there is no place

5120
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:28.010
beside Beau to get, unfortunately.

5121
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:29.276
That's as far as you can get.

5122
03:31:29.276 --> 03:31:30.420
SAM: Actually, wait.

5123
03:31:30.420 --> 03:31:32.540
If I stay where I was, would that be flanked?

5124
03:31:32.540 --> 03:31:33.380
MATT: You'd be flanked for Beauregard.

5125
03:31:33.380 --> 03:31:35.355
SAM: Then I'll stay where I was, sorry, sorry, sorry.

5126
03:31:35.355 --> 03:31:37.581
MATT: No worries. All right, so you stay there.

5127
03:31:37.581 --> 03:31:40.430
Stay there. Okay, that finishes your go.

5128
03:31:40.430 --> 03:31:42.230
Nott, top of the round, Jester, you're up.

5129
03:31:42.230 --> 03:31:44.670
SAM: The worst.

5130
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:47.070
TRAVIS: You still have--

5131
03:31:47.070 --> 03:31:49.903
LAURA: I know. I still have the spiritual weapon up.

5132
03:31:49.903 --> 03:31:52.036
(blows tired raspberry)

5133
03:31:52.036 --> 03:31:53.961
I'm just going to, like--

5134
03:31:53.961 --> 03:31:56.245
(blows tired raspberry)

5135
03:31:56.245 --> 03:31:58.740
TRAVIS: Oh man! Oh, this is it!

5136
03:31:58.740 --> 03:32:00.273
TALIESIN: What else? Well.

5137
03:32:00.273 --> 03:32:01.570
LAURA: I mean, I can do,

5138
03:32:01.570 --> 03:32:05.029
I've got one.

5139
03:32:05.029 --> 03:32:07.200
I've got one 3rd-level left.

5140
03:32:07.200 --> 03:32:09.090
That I could do Cure Wounds on Caleb with,

5141
03:32:09.090 --> 03:32:11.560
but it's going to be just enough that he'll

5142
03:32:11.560 --> 03:32:12.940
wake up and die again.

5143
03:32:12.940 --> 03:32:15.748
SAM: Yeah, but at least, well--

5144
03:32:15.748 --> 03:32:18.498
can you get to Caduceus or is he okay?

5145
03:32:18.498 --> 03:32:22.181
LAURA: No. I can't get to Caduceus.

5146
03:32:23.415 --> 03:32:25.420
SAM: Yeah, I mean, save what you can.

5147
03:32:25.420 --> 03:32:27.620
MATT: It's up to you.

5148
03:32:27.620 --> 03:32:29.510
LAURA: Is it, I mean.

5149
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:32.020
How long until he goes?

5150
03:32:32.020 --> 03:32:35.566
Does the bad guy get to go before Caleb gets to go?

5151
03:32:35.566 --> 03:32:38.142
MATT: Yeah.

5152
03:32:38.142 --> 03:32:39.350
This is your call.

5153
03:32:39.350 --> 03:32:41.070
Is this one of your last spell slots?

5154
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:42.778
LAURA: I've got three 1st-levels left

5155
03:32:42.778 --> 03:32:44.011
and one 3rd-level left.

5156
03:32:44.011 --> 03:32:45.869
MATT: Okay. Well, consider what those spell slots

5157
03:32:45.869 --> 03:32:48.402
would be useful for and decide accordingly.

5158
03:32:48.402 --> 03:32:50.143
The way things are going now.

5159
03:32:50.143 --> 03:32:52.606
Depending on what you have prepared.

5160
03:32:52.606 --> 03:32:54.150
TRAVIS: This is not your responsibility, also.

5161
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:56.470
LAURA: I've got that prepared.

5162
03:32:56.470 --> 03:32:59.100
I'll just Cure Wounds Caleb, then.

5163
03:32:59.100 --> 03:33:03.325
I'll reach down and cast Cure Wounds on you. Sorry bud.

5164
03:33:03.325 --> 03:33:04.266
MATT: At 1st-level?

5165
03:33:04.266 --> 03:33:08.396
LAURA: At 1st-level because my 3rd-level is a Revivify.

5166
03:33:08.396 --> 03:33:09.987
MATT: Oh, you did prepare that?

5167
03:33:09.987 --> 03:33:13.030
That's good. This is going real bad.

5168
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:14.610
LAURA: Yeah, seven points.

5169
03:33:14.610 --> 03:33:16.250
MATT: You heal seven points, Caleb.

5170
03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:18.370
SAM: What do you have to prepared?

5171
03:33:18.370 --> 03:33:21.471
LAURA: Revivify.
SAM: Oh my god.

5172
03:33:21.471 --> 03:33:22.830
Is that where we are right now?

5173
03:33:22.830 --> 03:33:24.708
MATT: Apparently.

5174
03:33:24.708 --> 03:33:27.060
TRAVIS: We're way past that.

5175
03:33:27.060 --> 03:33:28.110
MATT: That's your action.

5176
03:33:28.110 --> 03:33:30.787
LAURA: Then for my bonus action.

5177
03:33:30.787 --> 03:33:31.850
MATT: Still have your spiritual weapon up.

5178
03:33:31.850 --> 03:33:32.833
LAURA: I know.

5179
03:33:32.833 --> 03:33:35.573
I'm going to use my spiritual weapon and try to hit Yasha.

5180
03:33:35.573 --> 03:33:38.055
MATT: Try and hit Yasha.

5181
03:33:38.055 --> 03:33:39.312
Just going to move over.

5182
03:33:39.312 --> 03:33:41.293
SAM: Thunk!

5183
03:33:41.293 --> 03:33:43.090
MATT: What'd you roll to hit?

5184
03:33:43.090 --> 03:33:43.923
LAURA: 14.

5185
03:33:43.923 --> 03:33:45.206
TRAVIS: That's her AC.

5186
03:33:45.206 --> 03:33:46.297
LAURA: 13.

5187
03:33:46.297 --> 03:33:50.320
MATT: 13 just misses. (whoosh)

5188
03:33:50.320 --> 03:33:52.900
It just swings past her head as she pulls the blade up.

5189
03:33:52.900 --> 03:33:55.420
It looks like she's going for Beauregard,

5190
03:33:55.420 --> 03:33:57.975
which would be in a flanking position for her against,

5191
03:33:57.975 --> 03:34:00.180
although she did do reckless last turn,

5192
03:34:00.180 --> 03:34:01.880
so you do get an advantage on it.

5193
03:34:01.880 --> 03:34:02.930
I almost forgot that.

5194
03:34:05.540 --> 03:34:08.171
TALIESIN: Oh my god.
MATT: Aw!

5195
03:34:08.171 --> 03:34:09.187
TRAVIS: What is it?

5196
03:34:09.187 --> 03:34:12.495
MATT: Natural one! You guys, you're killing me!

5197
03:34:12.495 --> 03:34:13.820
You're killing me.

5198
03:34:13.820 --> 03:34:15.420
TALIESIN: That's not how this works.

5199
03:34:15.420 --> 03:34:16.862
Quite the opposite, in fact.

5200
03:34:16.862 --> 03:34:18.428
MATT: All right.

5201
03:34:18.428 --> 03:34:22.396
That finishes Jester's turn, unless you want to move.

5202
03:34:22.396 --> 03:34:24.580
LAURA: He'll get an attack of opportunity on me if I move.

5203
03:34:24.580 --> 03:34:26.051
MATT: If you move away from him, yes.

5204
03:34:26.051 --> 03:34:28.391
LAURA: I mean.

5205
03:34:28.391 --> 03:34:30.610
I don't know what else to do.

5206
03:34:30.610 --> 03:34:33.080
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah, I don't know.

5207
03:34:33.080 --> 03:34:34.946
I got.

5208
03:34:34.946 --> 03:34:37.221
I mean, other than, well, shit.

5209
03:34:38.237 --> 03:34:42.362
MARISHA: Has Yasha already used her reaction this turn?

5210
03:34:42.362 --> 03:34:44.362
TALIESIN: Yasha did use her reaction on me.

5211
03:34:44.362 --> 03:34:46.945
MATT: She did, but then she took her turn next,

5212
03:34:46.945 --> 03:34:50.410
so she has a reaction still.

5213
03:34:50.410 --> 03:34:52.060
Oh man, all right.

5214
03:34:52.060 --> 03:34:53.880
Is that your turn, Jester?

5215
03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:55.360
TALIESIN: Yeah, back to reaction.

5216
03:34:55.360 --> 03:34:58.930
LAURA: I'm going to, yeah, yeah, that's where I am.

5217
03:34:58.930 --> 03:35:01.132
TALIESIN: I'm a dumbass.

5218
03:35:02.610 --> 03:35:05.267
MATT: With that,

5219
03:35:05.267 --> 03:35:08.000
this guy's going to swoop back onto this end

5220
03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:10.640
to watch more of the chaos unfold.

5221
03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:11.823
LIAM: Fucking voyeur.

5222
03:35:11.823 --> 03:35:12.781
SAM: So creepy.

5223
03:35:12.781 --> 03:35:15.670
MATT: Straight up. Just watching this all go down.

5224
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:17.520
LIAM: Is he masturbating, too?

5225
03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:18.803
MATT: You see some movement in the corner of your eye.

5226
03:35:18.803 --> 03:35:19.961
LAURA and SAM: Ew!

5227
03:35:19.961 --> 03:35:21.903
MATT: No, it's fine.

5228
03:35:24.090 --> 03:35:25.820
It's his turn now.

5229
03:35:25.820 --> 03:35:26.653
TALIESIN: Shit, man.

5230
03:35:26.653 --> 03:35:28.270
LIAM: Look out, Arizona.

5231
03:35:28.270 --> 03:35:29.580
TALIESIN: I need some sort of heal, man.

5232
03:35:29.580 --> 03:35:32.079
MATT: All right. It's going to be--

5233
03:35:32.079 --> 03:35:33.000
TRAVIS: At least we're together at the end.

5234
03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:34.270
TALIESIN: I'm stabilized; I'm not awake.

5235
03:35:34.270 --> 03:35:35.820
SAM: Yeah, but you're stabilized.

5236
03:35:35.820 --> 03:35:37.160
MATT: You look at the ability, what was it?

5237
03:35:37.160 --> 03:35:38.718
TALIESIN: Yeah, on the beginning of my turn,

5238
03:35:38.718 --> 03:35:39.870
I auto-stabilized.

5239
03:35:39.870 --> 03:35:41.750
MATT: As part of the grave cleric?

5240
03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:42.975
TALIESIN: I've got the amulet.

5241
03:35:42.975 --> 03:35:44.874
LIAM: Oh, the Periapt!

5242
03:35:44.874 --> 03:35:46.211
MATT: But did you use it?

5243
03:35:46.211 --> 03:35:47.393
LIAM: No, I gave it to Caduceus ages ago.

5244
03:35:47.393 --> 03:35:50.150
MATT: How are you getting advantage on the death saves?

5245
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:51.543
LIAM: That was Beacon of Hope.

5246
03:35:51.543 --> 03:35:55.786
MATT: That's right, I forgot about that. Good call.

5247
03:35:55.786 --> 03:35:57.819
LIAM: We sometimes remember things.

5248
03:35:57.819 --> 03:35:59.935
TRAVIS and LIAM: Sometimes. Mostly.

5249
03:35:59.935 --> 03:36:02.760
MATT: All right, is going to unload on Jester.

5250
03:36:02.760 --> 03:36:04.567
Since you're healing and bringing the guys up.

5251
03:36:04.567 --> 03:36:06.692
LAURA: Yeah.

5252
03:36:06.692 --> 03:36:10.810
Once we're both down, you guys, run away.

5253
03:36:10.810 --> 03:36:12.068
Natural 20, didn't you?

5254
03:36:12.068 --> 03:36:15.578
MATT: No. That was a five. That would be a 14.

5255
03:36:15.578 --> 03:36:17.161
LAURA: (gasps) It didn't hit me!

5256
03:36:17.161 --> 03:36:17.994
MATT: That misses you.

5257
03:36:17.994 --> 03:36:18.827
LAURA: Shield!

5258
03:36:18.827 --> 03:36:21.590
MATT: The next strike, however, is a 25 to hit.

5259
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:23.573
LAURA: That did hit me, though.

5260
03:36:23.573 --> 03:36:25.139
LIAM: I'm so light-headed right now.

5261
03:36:25.139 --> 03:36:26.760
TALIESIN: I know, it's so hard to think.

5262
03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:29.770
It's really hard to think.

5263
03:36:29.770 --> 03:36:31.653
MATT: 21 points of lightning damage.

5264
03:36:31.653 --> 03:36:33.228
LAURA: Okay.

5265
03:36:33.228 --> 03:36:34.070
MATT: And--

5266
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:35.378
LIAM: Whap!

5267
03:36:37.461 --> 03:36:38.303
SAM: No problem.

5268
03:36:38.303 --> 03:36:41.020
MATT: Actually, you know what, no, I take that back.

5269
03:36:41.020 --> 03:36:43.569
SAM: No, that's fine. You can do that. She's fine.

5270
03:36:43.569 --> 03:36:44.440
LAURA: Shut up.

5271
03:36:44.440 --> 03:36:46.100
SAM She's fine!

5272
03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:50.866
MATT: Instead, the creature is going to--

5273
03:36:50.866 --> 03:36:52.441
LIAM: Have a change of heart?

5274
03:36:52.441 --> 03:36:54.165
MATT: -- step back this way.

5275
03:36:54.165 --> 03:36:55.845
Jester, you do have an attack of opportunity.

5276
03:36:55.845 --> 03:36:57.470
LAURA: Okay.

5277
03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:00.713
24.

5278
03:37:00.713 --> 03:37:04.880
MATT: That hits. Roll damage with your additional--

5279
03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:06.450
What's the additional damage you deal?

5280
03:37:06.450 --> 03:37:07.870
Is it poison?

5281
03:37:07.870 --> 03:37:10.240
LAURA: Oh, that's right, I do have poison damage.

5282
03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:14.050
MATT: Don't bother rolling it, it's immune.

5283
03:37:14.050 --> 03:37:16.620
Sorry, I always forget what it was.

5284
03:37:16.620 --> 03:37:18.724
I feel so bad!

5285
03:37:18.724 --> 03:37:20.650
I really was like, "Yay! Oh no, sorry."

5286
03:37:20.650 --> 03:37:23.890
I'm a total asshole, I'm so sorry, I did not mean that.

5287
03:37:23.890 --> 03:37:25.740
Roll damage for it.

5288
03:37:25.740 --> 03:37:27.923
LAURA: Six points of damage.

5289
03:37:27.923 --> 03:37:32.897
MATT: It's going to take its

5290
03:37:32.897 --> 03:37:34.647
lightning lance

5291
03:37:34.647 --> 03:37:39.647
and (whoosh) across the three of you.

5292
03:37:39.660 --> 03:37:41.472
LIAM: Is that a spell?

5293
03:37:41.472 --> 03:37:43.438
MATT: No. It's a special ability.

5294
03:37:43.438 --> 03:37:44.940
LAURA: Is it a ranged attack?

5295
03:37:44.940 --> 03:37:49.940
MATT: Technically, it is a magic effect.

5296
03:37:50.713 --> 03:37:53.290
You guys have to make dexterity saving throws.

5297
03:37:53.290 --> 03:37:55.700
LIAM: Counterspell would have zero, fuck all to do here.

5298
03:37:55.700 --> 03:37:57.510
MATT: It's not an actual spell, yeah.

5299
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:58.640
SAM: Uncanny dodge, also?

5300
03:37:58.640 --> 03:38:00.150
MATT: Uncanny dodge would affect it.

5301
03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:01.970
Make a dexterity saving throw.

5302
03:38:01.970 --> 03:38:03.430
You make it with disadvantage, I believe,

5303
03:38:03.430 --> 03:38:07.055
because you are prone.

5304
03:38:08.699 --> 03:38:09.598
LIAM: I failed.

5305
03:38:09.598 --> 03:38:12.100
MATT: Actually no, you don't have disadvantage on it.

5306
03:38:12.100 --> 03:38:12.933
LIAM: First roll was ass.

5307
03:38:12.933 --> 03:38:15.043
MATT: First roll? 27 points lightning damage.

5308
03:38:15.043 --> 03:38:15.920
LIAM: I'm out.

5309
03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:16.753
SAM: Fail.

5310
03:38:16.753 --> 03:38:19.461
MATT: You take half damage. You take--

5311
03:38:19.461 --> 03:38:20.469
LAURA: How do you know it was a fail?

5312
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:21.820
SAM: I rolled a four.

5313
03:38:21.820 --> 03:38:24.162
MATT: 13. Then.

5314
03:38:24.162 --> 03:38:25.570
LAURA: 18.

5315
03:38:25.570 --> 03:38:26.403
MATT: 18 succeeds.

5316
03:38:26.403 --> 03:38:27.970
You take 13 points of lightning damage.

5317
03:38:27.970 --> 03:38:30.004
LAURA: Oh, okay.

5318
03:38:30.004 --> 03:38:32.912
SAM: Hey.

5319
03:38:32.912 --> 03:38:34.500
LIAM: I've been almost doing something for 30 minutes.

5320
03:38:34.500 --> 03:38:36.133
And just whack, whack, whack.

5321
03:38:36.133 --> 03:38:39.410
TRAVIS: Yasha's been charmed for 30 minutes. That's insane.

5322
03:38:39.410 --> 03:38:44.072
MATT: It's moving back out of the range of this.

5323
03:38:44.072 --> 03:38:46.277
It's going to step away.

5324
03:38:46.277 --> 03:38:47.110
Do you have a reaction you want to take?

5325
03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:48.933
Oh, you don't have a melee weapon ready, so you don't.

5326
03:38:48.933 --> 03:38:53.582
SAM: My, oh. I mean, I have a weapon, but--

5327
03:38:53.582 --> 03:38:56.974
MATT: Right, but you don't have it ready.

5328
03:38:56.974 --> 03:38:58.430
SAM: Can I take an unarmed strike?

5329
03:38:58.430 --> 03:39:01.730
MATT: Sure, go for it.

5330
03:39:01.730 --> 03:39:03.689
SAM: Nope.

5331
03:39:03.689 --> 03:39:06.470
MATT: Worth a shot. All right, Caleb, your turn.

5332
03:39:06.470 --> 03:39:08.651
LIAM: Oh, right. It's a straight roll.

5333
03:39:08.651 --> 03:39:10.340
MATT: Straight death save roll.

5334
03:39:10.340 --> 03:39:11.173
LIAM: Fail.

5335
03:39:11.173 --> 03:39:14.089
MATT: First fail. Caduceus, death save for me.

5336
03:39:14.089 --> 03:39:15.196
TALIESIN: No, I'm stabilized.

5337
03:39:15.196 --> 03:39:18.555
MATT: You're stabilized. You're good. You are--

5338
03:39:18.555 --> 03:39:19.696
I cannot kill you!

5339
03:39:19.696 --> 03:39:21.929
TALIESIN: Good is a relative term.

5340
03:39:21.929 --> 03:39:24.780
MATT: True. All right, Beauregard.

5341
03:39:24.780 --> 03:39:26.271
MARISHA: I've got Yasha on my ass?

5342
03:39:26.271 --> 03:39:28.010
MATT: You do.

5343
03:39:28.010 --> 03:39:29.976
LAURA: Yeah, you do.

5344
03:39:29.976 --> 03:39:32.150
MARISHA: Just in the way I've been dreaming.

5345
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:34.375
MATT: Well, technically, no, go ahead.

5346
03:39:34.375 --> 03:39:36.671
Because you forgot to-- your turn.

5347
03:39:36.671 --> 03:39:37.950
MARISHA: I forgot to do what?

5348
03:39:37.950 --> 03:39:39.885
MATT: He moved away from you, you could have taken a

5349
03:39:39.885 --> 03:39:41.185
Sentinel attack to move him out of the--

5350
03:39:41.185 --> 03:39:42.018
MARISHA: I thought about that,

5351
03:39:42.018 --> 03:39:43.250
but then he wouldn't have moved, right?

5352
03:39:43.250 --> 03:39:45.590
MATT: That's true, he wouldn't move.

5353
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:46.423
MARISHA: Is that a bad thing?

5354
03:39:46.423 --> 03:39:49.069
MATT: Doesn't matter. What are you doing on your turn?

5355
03:39:49.069 --> 03:39:50.585
SAM: Shit.

5356
03:39:50.585 --> 03:39:53.687
Could I have done a Shocking Grasp as my melee attack?

5357
03:39:53.687 --> 03:39:55.336
MATT: Not as a reaction.

5358
03:39:55.336 --> 03:39:56.744
SAM: Okay.

5359
03:39:56.744 --> 03:40:01.744
MATT: If you had War Caster, I think you can.

5360
03:40:02.072 --> 03:40:04.130
MARISHA: I'm going to elbow Yasha in the nose.

5361
03:40:04.130 --> 03:40:05.660
MATT: Go for it.

5362
03:40:05.660 --> 03:40:07.550
MARISHA: Straight attack, right.

5363
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:08.383
LIAM: Yes.

5364
03:40:08.383 --> 03:40:10.094
MARISHA: Mmm hmm, that hits.

5365
03:40:10.094 --> 03:40:11.142
24.

5366
03:40:11.142 --> 03:40:13.184
MATT: That hits.

5367
03:40:13.184 --> 03:40:14.670
Roll damage.

5368
03:40:14.670 --> 03:40:16.170
MARISHA: Oh, I should have used my staff for this one.

5369
03:40:16.170 --> 03:40:18.260
Can I use my staff for this one?

5370
03:40:18.260 --> 03:40:20.229
MATT: Sure, go for it, if you want to.

5371
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:21.520
Yeah, go for it.

5372
03:40:21.520 --> 03:40:25.110
MARISHA: It doesn't matter. It's actually technically lower.

5373
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:26.760
Seven damage.
MATT: Seven points damage,

5374
03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:29.670
reduced to half, so three points motion damage to her.

5375
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:30.911
Make another wisdom save.

5376
03:40:30.911 --> 03:40:31.744
TRAVIS: No more advantage, right?

5377
03:40:31.744 --> 03:40:33.000
MATT: Correct, just a single roll.

5378
03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:34.460
TRAVIS: Gil.

5379
03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:36.060
MARISHA: Fuck us, Gil.
SAM: Fuck us, Gil.

5380
03:40:37.550 --> 03:40:40.406
TRAVIS: Nine.
MATT: Nine, she doesn't work.

5381
03:40:40.406 --> 03:40:42.400
Next.
MARISHA: She doesn't save?

5382
03:40:42.400 --> 03:40:45.450
MATT: No, she doesn't make the save. She's still charmed.

5383
03:40:45.450 --> 03:40:47.970
SAM and MARISHA: We didn't want him to fuck us.

5384
03:40:47.970 --> 03:40:49.410
SAM: We wanted him to not fuck us.

5385
03:40:49.410 --> 03:40:50.865
<i>We</i> said the wrong thing!

5386
03:40:50.865 --> 03:40:52.366
MATT: You did, you did.

5387
03:40:52.366 --> 03:40:54.301
Crack across her face, Yasha goes--

5388
03:40:54.301 --> 03:40:55.928
TALIESIN: She has to roll really goddamn high.

5389
03:40:55.928 --> 03:40:57.895
LAURA: Yeah, she has to roll, like, a natural 20.

5390
03:40:57.895 --> 03:41:01.103
TALIESIN: 17, I believe, is what she has to roll.

5391
03:41:01.103 --> 03:41:03.114
TRAVIS: That would not have--

5392
03:41:03.114 --> 03:41:04.760
MATT: That's your first attack, Beau.

5393
03:41:04.760 --> 03:41:06.993
LAURA: Hit her again.

5394
03:41:06.993 --> 03:41:08.176
MATT: What are you doing, Beau?

5395
03:41:08.176 --> 03:41:09.418
MARISHA: It's useless.

5396
03:41:09.418 --> 03:41:10.776
LIAM and LAURA: No, it's not.

5397
03:41:10.776 --> 03:41:11.609
LAURA: Hit her again.

5398
03:41:11.609 --> 03:41:13.540
MATT: The first hit does nothing.

5399
03:41:13.540 --> 03:41:15.843
You have another attack and a bonus. What're you doing?

5400
03:41:15.843 --> 03:41:17.489
LIAM: Turn the gooch, come on.

5401
03:41:17.489 --> 03:41:19.610
MARISHA: Fine, I will hit her again, I will hit her again.

5402
03:41:19.610 --> 03:41:22.876
I guess we don't want her to-- 18.

5403
03:41:22.876 --> 03:41:24.475
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

5404
03:41:24.475 --> 03:41:26.250
LIAM: Take her out. One of these will take her out of it.

5405
03:41:26.250 --> 03:41:28.516
MARISHA: That's eight damage.

5406
03:41:28.516 --> 03:41:29.758
MATT: Reduced to four.

5407
03:41:29.758 --> 03:41:30.883
She takes four points of bludgeoning damage.

5408
03:41:30.883 --> 03:41:32.074
TRAVIS: Yes.

5409
03:41:33.016 --> 03:41:33.849
13.

5410
03:41:33.849 --> 03:41:36.440
MATT: 13. She maintains.

5411
03:41:36.440 --> 03:41:37.851
SAM: Goddamn it.

5412
03:41:37.851 --> 03:41:39.711
MATT: Bonus attack.

5413
03:41:39.711 --> 03:41:42.594
MARISHA: She has to roll a 17 or higher.

5414
03:41:42.594 --> 03:41:45.000
Yeah, that hits. 19.

5415
03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:47.350
MATT: 19, go ahead and roll damage.

5416
03:41:47.350 --> 03:41:49.530
Just smacking her across the head and then punching.

5417
03:41:49.530 --> 03:41:50.363
Roll damage for the punch.

5418
03:41:50.363 --> 03:41:51.205
LIAM: Come on, Slow-regard.

5419
03:41:51.205 --> 03:41:53.900
MARISHA: Ten damage.
TRAVIS: Ten damage?

5420
03:41:53.900 --> 03:41:55.507
MATT: Reduced to five.

5421
03:41:55.507 --> 03:41:56.340
TRAVIS: Come on, CR dice.

5422
03:41:56.340 --> 03:41:57.970
MATT: Mark the five.

5423
03:41:57.970 --> 03:41:58.803
MARISHA: 16.

5424
03:41:58.803 --> 03:42:01.269
MARISHA: That's what we need. We needed 17.

5425
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:05.452
(yelling)

5426
03:42:05.452 --> 03:42:07.201
Just beat the shit out of my friend!

5427
03:42:07.201 --> 03:42:09.480
MATT: Take the five damage for Yasha on top of that.

5428
03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:12.340
With a third hit (impact) "Ugh."

5429
03:42:12.340 --> 03:42:15.480
MARISHA: I go: You are in a toxic relationship.

5430
03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:19.932
MATT: Her fist catches the last punch and she goes,

5431
03:42:19.932 --> 03:42:22.960
"I'm sorry."
MARISHA: Fucking gaslighters,

5432
03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:25.040
come on, let's go.

5433
03:42:25.040 --> 03:42:26.930
MATT: She looks over towards the demon and the rage

5434
03:42:26.930 --> 03:42:28.860
you saw before goes super deep.

5435
03:42:28.860 --> 03:42:31.140
You see veins bulge in her forehead.

5436
03:42:31.140 --> 03:42:34.840
Her eyes narrow and you see foam forming up

5437
03:42:34.840 --> 03:42:37.050
at the corners of her mouth.

5438
03:42:37.050 --> 03:42:38.934
So she is no longer charmed.

5439
03:42:38.934 --> 03:42:40.820
MARISHA: I am going to now move.

5440
03:42:40.820 --> 03:42:43.320
Because she won't deck me in the face if I leave.

5441
03:42:44.770 --> 03:42:46.211
MATT: You assume so.

5442
03:42:47.095 --> 03:42:49.445
MARISHA: I'm going to move

5443
03:42:49.445 --> 03:42:50.278
where though?

5444
03:42:50.278 --> 03:42:51.978
LAURA: Give your healing potion

5445
03:42:51.978 --> 03:42:53.750
to Caduceus.
MARISHA: I use my bonus action

5446
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:54.583
to beat her in the face.

5447
03:42:54.583 --> 03:42:56.473
LAURA: Just kidding.
MARISHA: I'm going to--

5448
03:42:56.473 --> 03:43:00.724
(laughter)

5449
03:43:00.724 --> 03:43:02.296
MARISHA: I don't want to get near this thing,

5450
03:43:02.296 --> 03:43:03.441
but I don't want to be in a line.

5451
03:43:03.441 --> 03:43:05.600
I'm just going to shift over like here a little bit.

5452
03:43:05.600 --> 03:43:06.500
MATT: Okay, you got it.
MARISHA: Kind of get out

5453
03:43:06.500 --> 03:43:07.820
of the way for Yasha.

5454
03:43:07.820 --> 03:43:09.560
MATT: Perfect, all right.

5455
03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:12.180
That brings us to Fjord's turn.

5456
03:43:12.180 --> 03:43:16.100
TRAVIS: I'll walk up and stand and-- is Caleb, are you down?

5457
03:43:16.100 --> 03:43:17.160
You're unconscious, right?

5458
03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:19.780
Yeah, I'll try and step over Caleb

5459
03:43:19.780 --> 03:43:21.270
and stand in front of him.

5460
03:43:21.270 --> 03:43:22.420
Between him and the demon.

5461
03:43:22.420 --> 03:43:24.052
MATT: You got it.

5462
03:43:24.052 --> 03:43:28.000
TRAVIS: Two Eldritch blasts.

5463
03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:30.150
SAM: Do-si-do, motherfuckers.

5464
03:43:30.150 --> 03:43:32.280
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17 does not hit.

5465
03:43:32.280 --> 03:43:33.400
It misses by one.

5466
03:43:33.400 --> 03:43:34.960
TRAVIS: Okay, next.

5467
03:43:34.960 --> 03:43:37.057
And a 10.

5468
03:43:37.057 --> 03:43:38.523
MATT: Both miss, unfortunately.

5469
03:43:38.523 --> 03:43:39.356
LIAM: Dammit, Bobby.

5470
03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:42.380
MATT: You're shook.

5471
03:43:43.450 --> 03:43:44.350
You're just shook.

5472
03:43:45.277 --> 03:43:48.430
Can't quite make them attacks land, I'm sorry.

5473
03:43:48.430 --> 03:43:50.510
All right, that finishes your go.

5474
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:51.730
TRAVIS: Sure does.
MATT: All right.

5475
03:43:51.730 --> 03:43:53.010
Yasha's turn.

5476
03:43:53.010 --> 03:43:54.610
Yasha, freed from the charm.

5477
03:43:56.830 --> 03:43:57.770
I'm not even going to tell you what she does.

5478
03:43:57.770 --> 03:43:59.050
She knows what she's going to do.

5479
03:43:59.050 --> 03:44:01.270
She's so angry that she was forced to attack her friends

5480
03:44:01.270 --> 03:44:06.270
and take five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,

5481
03:44:06.580 --> 03:44:08.500
and is going to take two reckless attacks against it.

5482
03:44:08.500 --> 03:44:09.798
Go ahead and roll attacks.

5483
03:44:09.798 --> 03:44:12.011
MARISHA: Kill, kill.

5484
03:44:12.011 --> 03:44:14.522
TRAVIS: I don't know what dice to use anymore.

5485
03:44:14.522 --> 03:44:16.463
MARISHA: Everything's a lie. Everything's a lie!

5486
03:44:17.652 --> 03:44:19.000
TRAVIS: I don't know what's happening right now.

5487
03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:20.940
That's shit. That does not hit.

5488
03:44:20.940 --> 03:44:23.451
MATT: Okay, next attack, still reckless.

5489
03:44:23.451 --> 03:44:25.401
LIAM: (singing) Everything is awesome!

5490
03:44:26.300 --> 03:44:29.283
Everything is cool when you're part of a team?

5491
03:44:30.730 --> 03:44:31.760
TRAVIS: 20.

5492
03:44:31.760 --> 03:44:34.570
MATT: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll a full damage for her.

5493
03:44:34.570 --> 03:44:35.940
MARISHA: Lego showed us the way.

5494
03:44:37.785 --> 03:44:38.619
TRAVIS: Okay.

5495
03:44:38.619 --> 03:44:39.452
12, 13.

5496
03:44:41.507 --> 03:44:43.134
19, 20, 21.

5497
03:44:43.134 --> 03:44:45.280
21 points of slashing--
MATT: 21 points damage.

5498
03:44:45.280 --> 03:44:47.180
The first strike whips the second one.

5499
03:44:48.920 --> 03:44:50.890
Carves through a big section of its chest,

5500
03:44:50.890 --> 03:44:53.576
leaving this heavy wound, blood splatters

5501
03:44:53.576 --> 03:44:57.044
and hisses when it hits the ground, releasing steam

5502
03:44:57.044 --> 03:44:59.250
from the fiendish gore that is spattered

5503
03:44:59.250 --> 03:45:00.410
across the stone.

5504
03:45:00.410 --> 03:45:02.100
The creature's looking really hurt.

5505
03:45:03.340 --> 03:45:04.940
It's looking back over its shoulder

5506
03:45:04.940 --> 03:45:07.230
to where the opening was and sees that it's closed

5507
03:45:07.230 --> 03:45:08.380
and is like (growling).

5508
03:45:09.627 --> 03:45:10.490
You guys have closed its exit.

5509
03:45:10.490 --> 03:45:12.620
LAURA: Yeah, we have. (fake sobs)

5510
03:45:12.620 --> 03:45:15.360
MATT: All right, that brings us to Nott's turn.

5511
03:45:15.360 --> 03:45:17.900
SAM: Oh, she's engaged. I fire.

5512
03:45:19.730 --> 03:45:21.050
TALIESIN: You turn and fire across Beau.

5513
03:45:21.050 --> 03:45:22.512
SAM: Yes, 20 something.
MATT: That hits.

5514
03:45:22.512 --> 03:45:25.040
SAM: 26 or something crazy.

5515
03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:27.270
Yes!
LAURA: Ooh!

5516
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:30.910
SAM: 25 points of damage.

5517
03:45:30.910 --> 03:45:34.551
MATT: Ooh! (inhales)

5518
03:45:34.551 --> 03:45:36.901
Ooh, looking real bad!

5519
03:45:36.901 --> 03:45:38.034
SAM: I will take a swig

5520
03:45:38.034 --> 03:45:40.700
and fire again.
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

5521
03:45:40.700 --> 03:45:44.200
SAM: 21 points to hit.
MATT: To hit, does hit.

5522
03:45:44.200 --> 03:45:45.660
Roll damage.

5523
03:45:45.660 --> 03:45:48.280
SAM: My great-- eight more points of damage.

5524
03:45:48.280 --> 03:45:51.060
SAM: All right, that finishes your turn, Nott.

5525
03:45:51.060 --> 03:45:52.940
Going to move?

5526
03:45:52.940 --> 03:45:54.730
SAM: Caleb's still down.

5527
03:45:54.730 --> 03:45:56.290
You know what, we're all clumped, I'll move.

5528
03:45:56.290 --> 03:45:58.280
I'll move towards the water.

5529
03:45:58.280 --> 03:45:59.850
MATT: Over here?
SAM: Yes.

5530
03:45:59.850 --> 03:46:01.627
Just away from the clump, yeah.

5531
03:46:01.627 --> 03:46:02.524
MATT: You got it.

5532
03:46:02.524 --> 03:46:04.020
Okay.

5533
03:46:04.020 --> 03:46:05.310
That finishes that.

5534
03:46:05.310 --> 03:46:06.943
That brings us to...

5535
03:46:08.960 --> 03:46:10.538
SAM: Live, Caleb, live!

5536
03:46:10.538 --> 03:46:12.123
MATT: Top of the round. Jester.

5537
03:46:12.123 --> 03:46:13.805
SAM: You've never given up on anything in your life!

5538
03:46:13.805 --> 03:46:15.080
LAURA: I'm going to move my spiritual weapon up

5539
03:46:15.080 --> 03:46:17.096
to try to hit him.

5540
03:46:17.096 --> 03:46:17.938
MATT: It can move 20 feet?

5541
03:46:17.938 --> 03:46:19.290
LAURA: It can move, I think, 30 feet.

5542
03:46:19.290 --> 03:46:20.938
TALIESIN: There's still that motherfucker in the corner.

5543
03:46:20.938 --> 03:46:23.317
LAURA: Yeah, but we can't hit him. He's ethereal.

5544
03:46:23.317 --> 03:46:24.717
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

5545
03:46:24.717 --> 03:46:26.400
MATT: Move 20 feet?

5546
03:46:26.400 --> 03:46:27.660
LAURA: I think it can move 30 feet.

5547
03:46:27.660 --> 03:46:29.670
MATT: I think it might be 20.
LAURA: Oh, really?

5548
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:33.040
MATT: Double-check for me.
LIAM: Yeah, 20 for spiritual.

5549
03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:34.150
LAURA: Oh, really?
MATT: Yeah.

5550
03:46:34.150 --> 03:46:35.637
LAURA: Balls, balls.
MATT: Do you want to keep

5551
03:46:35.637 --> 03:46:37.290
it where it is or do you want to move it?

5552
03:46:37.290 --> 03:46:39.350
LAURA: Oh, wait that's the wrong thing.

5553
03:46:39.350 --> 03:46:41.370
I guess keep it where it is then,

5554
03:46:41.370 --> 03:46:44.240
in case the bad guy in the corner comes down.

5555
03:46:44.240 --> 03:46:45.800
MATT: You got it.

5556
03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:49.472
LAURA: I'm going to cast...

5557
03:46:53.878 --> 03:46:55.530
Guiding Bolt at him?
MATT: Go for it.

5558
03:46:55.530 --> 03:46:57.433
Roll for an attack.

5559
03:46:57.433 --> 03:46:59.066
MARISHA: Up the butt.

5560
03:46:59.066 --> 03:47:00.366
LAURA: Guiding Bolt.

5561
03:47:00.366 --> 03:47:03.113
MARISHA and LAURA: Up the butt!

5562
03:47:04.647 --> 03:47:06.900
LAURA: That did not hit.

5563
03:47:06.900 --> 03:47:08.528
It was a 10.

5564
03:47:08.528 --> 03:47:10.190
MATT: Arcs off.

5565
03:47:10.190 --> 03:47:12.262
Your hand shaking as you go to release it.

5566
03:47:12.262 --> 03:47:15.620
And, unable to control the release of divine energy,

5567
03:47:15.620 --> 03:47:16.960
it misses by about a foot.

5568
03:47:17.960 --> 03:47:19.220
LAURA: Oops.

5569
03:47:19.220 --> 03:47:20.870
MATT: Stay put or you want to move?

5570
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:22.150
LAURA: Huh?

5571
03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:23.467
Heal spell?

5572
03:47:23.467 --> 03:47:25.130
Oh, are you still unconscious?

5573
03:47:25.130 --> 03:47:27.581
SAM: Yes!
LIAM: Super unconscious.

5574
03:47:27.581 --> 03:47:29.600
LAURA: Oh no!
SAM: So is Caduceus.

5575
03:47:31.060 --> 03:47:34.393
LAURA: I thought he was about to die, though.

5576
03:47:35.928 --> 03:47:38.630
MATT: That's your action, bonus action.

5577
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:39.770
You can move if you want to.

5578
03:47:39.770 --> 03:47:42.740
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- oh no, that's an action.

5579
03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:45.750
Motherfucker.

5580
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:50.450
I'm going to-- for my movement, can I try to pull Caleb back

5581
03:47:50.450 --> 03:47:51.933
a little bit?

5582
03:47:51.933 --> 03:47:53.549
MATT: Sure.

5583
03:47:53.549 --> 03:47:55.989
LIAM: He instantly fails a death save.

5584
03:47:55.989 --> 03:47:57.297
MATT: Across the giant rocks.

5585
03:47:57.297 --> 03:47:59.250
LAURA: No, no, no. Into the tunnel.

5586
03:47:59.250 --> 03:48:01.195
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you can pull him about there.

5587
03:48:01.195 --> 03:48:02.182
SAM: That's clutch.

5588
03:48:02.182 --> 03:48:03.138
MATT: Half movement.

5589
03:48:03.138 --> 03:48:04.430
You pull him out of the way.

5590
03:48:04.430 --> 03:48:05.657
LAURA: It's something.
SAM: It's great.

5591
03:48:05.657 --> 03:48:07.320
Especially if they throw the javelin thing.

5592
03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:08.360
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn.

5593
03:48:08.360 --> 03:48:09.943
LAURA: Sorry about that.

5594
03:48:09.943 --> 03:48:11.100
MATT: At the end of your turn, the held action

5595
03:48:11.100 --> 03:48:14.800
of the incubus, it uses its ability to become

5596
03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:16.050
not ethereal any further.

5597
03:48:17.756 --> 03:48:20.428
LAURA: Oh, so I would have gotten to, oh no, that was-- no.

5598
03:48:21.475 --> 03:48:23.467
MATT: All right, so, that's the end of your turn?

5599
03:48:23.467 --> 03:48:24.567
LAURA: Yeah.

5600
03:48:24.567 --> 03:48:25.817
MARISHA: He's not ethereal no more?

5601
03:48:25.817 --> 03:48:26.650
LIAM: He's a real boy.

5602
03:48:26.650 --> 03:48:27.850
He's a real perv.

5603
03:48:27.850 --> 03:48:30.080
MATT: You hear this sound.

5604
03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:30.913
MARISHA: You piece of shit.

5605
03:48:30.913 --> 03:48:33.240
MATT: This voice in your head, Beauregard.

5606
03:48:33.240 --> 03:48:36.290
Saying, "We haven't tangled yet."

5607
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:41.310
You glance over your-- look forward.

5608
03:48:41.310 --> 03:48:42.780
It's no longer ethereal, in that moment you

5609
03:48:42.780 --> 03:48:43.980
take a wisdom save.

5610
03:48:43.980 --> 03:48:45.700
You don't have advantage.

5611
03:48:45.700 --> 03:48:48.127
MARISHA: No more blessing.
TALIESIN: No.

5612
03:48:50.410 --> 03:48:52.200
MARISHA: 22.

5613
03:48:52.200 --> 03:48:53.940
MATT: Shit, yeah, you ignore it.

5614
03:48:53.940 --> 03:48:56.994
MARISHA: I turn around and I go: You're not my type.

5615
03:48:56.994 --> 03:48:59.177
MATT: (laughs)

5616
03:48:59.177 --> 03:49:00.686
SAM: I like them thick.

5617
03:49:00.686 --> 03:49:02.177
MATT: It's going to fly over this way.

5618
03:49:02.177 --> 03:49:03.593
LIAM: Eh...

5619
03:49:05.777 --> 03:49:09.585
MATT: That's about as far as it can get with its speed.

5620
03:49:09.585 --> 03:49:12.103
LIAM: Fuck off, Alan Cumming.

5621
03:49:12.103 --> 03:49:14.445
MATT: All right, finishes its go.

5622
03:49:16.365 --> 03:49:18.065
MARISHA: Alan Cumming's a different story, though.

5623
03:49:18.065 --> 03:49:19.208
LIAM: That's for you.

5624
03:49:19.208 --> 03:49:21.195
MARISHA: That's for me, personally, not for Beau.

5625
03:49:21.195 --> 03:49:23.883
MATT: Since Yasha's right there in the front--

5626
03:49:23.883 --> 03:49:26.014
LIAM: Everybody gets a pass for Alan Cumming.

5627
03:49:26.014 --> 03:49:27.872
MATT: -- he's going to strike. Just can't get--

5628
03:49:27.872 --> 03:49:29.550
LIAM: I just said that on the internet.

5629
03:49:29.550 --> 03:49:32.283
No, actually, it does have fly speed.

5630
03:49:32.283 --> 03:49:35.546
MARISHA: Everyone knows that's true already.

5631
03:49:35.546 --> 03:49:37.580
TALIESIN: Not an attack, but a reaction, right?

5632
03:49:37.580 --> 03:49:39.858
MATT: It doesn't leave her melee range.

5633
03:49:39.858 --> 03:49:41.740
It just moves over her.

5634
03:49:41.740 --> 03:49:42.840
Landing on the ground.

5635
03:49:43.696 --> 03:49:45.080
It's going to go ahead and--

5636
03:49:46.830 --> 03:49:49.923
LAURA: Are the ceilings high enough for him to do that?

5637
03:49:49.923 --> 03:49:51.923
For sure?

5638
03:49:51.923 --> 03:49:53.956
MATT: Oh, valid point, actually.

5639
03:49:53.956 --> 03:49:55.470
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: It's low enough.

5640
03:49:55.470 --> 03:49:56.870
TALIESIN: That's right, the description.

5641
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:58.270
MATT: Yeah, no, that's true.

5642
03:49:58.270 --> 03:50:00.622
Kind of, can't quite do it.

5643
03:50:00.622 --> 03:50:03.790
So.
MARISHA: Obey the description.

5644
03:50:05.318 --> 03:50:07.110
MATT: It's just instead going to leap over,

5645
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:08.767
or step over these things.

5646
03:50:08.767 --> 03:50:11.410
It reduces its speed dramatically. It can only

5647
03:50:11.410 --> 03:50:13.550
really get there.

5648
03:50:13.550 --> 03:50:16.300
LIAM: (growly voice) Like Vex, I was meant to fly.

5649
03:50:21.182 --> 03:50:22.160
MATT: It's going to unleash on you, Fjord.

5650
03:50:22.160 --> 03:50:23.460
MARISHA: Old campaign references.

5651
03:50:25.627 --> 03:50:28.341
We are going to try.

5652
03:50:28.341 --> 03:50:29.724
MATT: 19 to hit.

5653
03:50:29.724 --> 03:50:31.425
TRAVIS: That hits.
MATT: All right.

5654
03:50:31.425 --> 03:50:36.150
You take 17 points lightning damage.

5655
03:50:36.150 --> 03:50:38.100
As a lightning arc shoots from its claw

5656
03:50:38.100 --> 03:50:39.500
and strikes into your chest.

5657
03:50:40.900 --> 03:50:42.320
Second attack against you.

5658
03:50:43.170 --> 03:50:46.410
25 to hit?
TRAVIS: Mm hmm.

5659
03:50:46.410 --> 03:50:51.410
MATT: Take 18, 19 points of lightning damage.

5660
03:50:52.527 --> 03:50:55.160
(crying)

5661
03:50:55.160 --> 03:50:58.190
LAURA: Oh god, what have we done?

5662
03:50:58.190 --> 03:51:00.220
LIAM: Sonic boom.
LAURA: What have I done?

5663
03:51:00.220 --> 03:51:01.053
I'm the stupidest.

5664
03:51:01.053 --> 03:51:02.369
MATT: Third attack against you.

5665
03:51:02.369 --> 03:51:04.100
It's ranged. I'm supposed to roll to hit.

5666
03:51:05.258 --> 03:51:07.920
It's 20 to hit.
TRAVIS: Hits.

5667
03:51:07.920 --> 03:51:08.753
MATT: Yeah.

5668
03:51:08.753 --> 03:51:11.020
It is not an auto-crit, but you do lose a death save.

5669
03:51:11.020 --> 03:51:12.180
TRAVIS: Just one?
MATT: Just one.

5670
03:51:12.180 --> 03:51:14.947
LIAM: It's ranged, not melee.

5671
03:51:14.947 --> 03:51:17.196
SAM: You have one job.

5672
03:51:17.196 --> 03:51:18.029
LAURA: No.

5673
03:51:18.029 --> 03:51:19.000
No, that's not true.

5674
03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:21.710
MATT: Your turn, Caleb. Make a death save.

5675
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:23.720
LIAM: Matt Colville meteorite die.

5676
03:51:23.720 --> 03:51:24.840
Don't fuck me, Matt.

5677
03:51:24.840 --> 03:51:26.150
Natural 20.

5678
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:27.410
MATT: Natural 20.

5679
03:51:27.410 --> 03:51:29.047
You stabilize and you get a turn.

5680
03:51:29.047 --> 03:51:31.857
MARISHA: You stabilize!
LIAM: I get a turn?

5681
03:51:31.857 --> 03:51:35.117
MATT: If you roll a natural 20, if I recall--

5682
03:51:35.117 --> 03:51:36.633
LAURA: You get one hit point, don't you?

5683
03:51:37.475 --> 03:51:39.266
MATT: Which means, and it happens

5684
03:51:39.266 --> 03:51:40.600
at the top of your turn, so--

5685
03:51:40.600 --> 03:51:42.170
MARISHA: We learned this because of Handbooker Helper.

5686
03:51:42.170 --> 03:51:43.430
MATT: Yep, yep.

5687
03:51:43.430 --> 03:51:45.582
LAURA: Oh my god, you're alive.

5688
03:51:45.582 --> 03:51:46.704
MARISHA: Thank you, Dani Carr.

5689
03:51:46.704 --> 03:51:47.537
MATT: I'm pretty sure.

5690
03:51:47.537 --> 03:51:48.612
Just double checking, but I'm pretty sure

5691
03:51:48.612 --> 03:51:49.537
that's how it goes.

5692
03:51:50.398 --> 03:51:51.800
LAURA: Oh my god, Caleb, I brought you back.

5693
03:51:51.800 --> 03:51:53.300
Aren't you so happy?

5694
03:51:54.174 --> 03:51:56.657
TRAVIS: (groaning)

5695
03:51:56.657 --> 03:51:58.650
MATT: Yep, if you roll a 20, you regain a hit point.

5696
03:51:58.650 --> 03:51:59.540
You are conscious at the top of your turn.

5697
03:51:59.540 --> 03:52:00.595
What do you do?

5698
03:52:00.595 --> 03:52:01.635
You are prone, though.

5699
03:52:01.635 --> 03:52:03.361
SAM: The thing that you've been waiting to do.

5700
03:52:03.361 --> 03:52:04.886
LIAM: Stand up. <i>Ja.</i>

5701
03:52:04.886 --> 03:52:06.910
Can I see the bull man?

5702
03:52:06.910 --> 03:52:08.090
MATT: From where you are now, no.

5703
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:11.733
LIAM: I am going to take-- go five feet out.

5704
03:52:11.733 --> 03:52:12.620
Can I see the bull man?

5705
03:52:12.620 --> 03:52:14.010
MATT: Barely around the corner, yeah.

5706
03:52:14.010 --> 03:52:19.010
LIAM: Okay, put some molasses on my lip and I cast Slow.

5707
03:52:19.546 --> 03:52:20.737
MATT: Okay.

5708
03:52:23.762 --> 03:52:24.940
MATT: What is the--?
LIAM: Wisdom 16.

5709
03:52:24.940 --> 03:52:26.970
MATT: Wisdom 16. That's a 14.

5710
03:52:28.614 --> 03:52:29.570
LIAM: No reactions.

5711
03:52:29.570 --> 03:52:31.580
It can do an action or a bonus action.

5712
03:52:31.580 --> 03:52:33.540
Its AC is down two.

5713
03:52:33.540 --> 03:52:35.530
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: I will back up

5714
03:52:35.530 --> 03:52:37.730
five feet. Get the fuck out.

5715
03:52:38.953 --> 03:52:40.160
MATT: The creature is now--.

5716
03:52:40.160 --> 03:52:43.750
Even the arcs in its hands are going--.

5717
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:44.583
They're slowing.

5718
03:52:44.583 --> 03:52:45.849
LAURA: Caleb, that would have been

5719
03:52:45.849 --> 03:52:48.374
really useful a lot earlier in this fight.

5720
03:52:48.374 --> 03:52:51.014
LIAM: (slowly) You should have healed me.

5721
03:52:51.014 --> 03:52:52.625
(laughter)

5722
03:52:52.625 --> 03:52:53.804
LAURA: I've been healing you.

5723
03:52:53.804 --> 03:52:55.530
That's all I've been doing.

5724
03:52:55.530 --> 03:52:56.950
MATT: Caleb, end of your turn.
LIAM: Blood coming out of

5725
03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:57.783
my eyes, yes.

5726
03:52:57.783 --> 03:52:59.366
MATT: Caduceus, you're stabilized.

5727
03:53:00.719 --> 03:53:02.000
Beauregard.

5728
03:53:05.798 --> 03:53:08.500
MARISHA: Pop pop. I'm going to go up and do the thing.

5729
03:53:08.500 --> 03:53:10.540
I'm going to do the thing I do best.

5730
03:53:10.540 --> 03:53:13.330
I'm going to punch him in the dick.

5731
03:53:13.330 --> 03:53:15.220
LIAM: Negative two AC, negative two AC.

5732
03:53:15.220 --> 03:53:16.540
MARISHA: Negative two AC, negative two AC.

5733
03:53:16.540 --> 03:53:18.610
TALIESIN: Do you get an advantage because of flanking or no?

5734
03:53:18.610 --> 03:53:19.866
MARISHA: Do I get an advantage?

5735
03:53:19.866 --> 03:53:21.520
MATT: You're not flanking.
MARISHA: 20 total.

5736
03:53:21.520 --> 03:53:22.955
MATT: Flanking is on the opposite side.

5737
03:53:22.955 --> 03:53:25.310
20 hits.
LAURA: 20.

5738
03:53:25.310 --> 03:53:28.416
MARISHA: Fucking bullshit, fucking rolls.

5739
03:53:28.416 --> 03:53:30.499
Six damage.

5740
03:53:30.499 --> 03:53:31.880
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Second attack.

5741
03:53:32.884 --> 03:53:34.930
That's a natural 18.

5742
03:53:34.930 --> 03:53:36.855
For six, 26.

5743
03:53:36.855 --> 03:53:38.271
LAURA: Is that a little goldfish in there?

5744
03:53:38.271 --> 03:53:40.280
MARISHA: Yeah, a little goldfish. Isn't that cute?

5745
03:53:40.280 --> 03:53:41.860
This is from Green Leaf Dice.

5746
03:53:41.860 --> 03:53:42.740
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

5747
03:53:45.647 --> 03:53:47.800
MARISHA: That's good. That's good. Ten damage.

5748
03:53:47.800 --> 03:53:49.122
MATT: How do you want to do this?

5749
03:53:49.122 --> 03:53:51.289
(yelling)

5750
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:54.790
SAM: How do you want to do-regard?

5751
03:53:56.210 --> 03:53:58.500
MARISHA: On that goldfish die.

5752
03:53:59.628 --> 03:54:01.127
DANI: (screams faintly)

5753
03:54:01.127 --> 03:54:02.215
MARISHA: Okay.

5754
03:54:02.215 --> 03:54:05.198
(laughter)

5755
03:54:05.198 --> 03:54:06.906
MATT: You can hear Dani.

5756
03:54:06.906 --> 03:54:08.893
LIAM: Dani Carr just exploded into glitter.

5757
03:54:08.893 --> 03:54:11.676
TRAVIS: I think some of them are in the office.

5758
03:54:12.900 --> 03:54:16.310
MARISHA: As I see the lightning strikes move

5759
03:54:16.310 --> 03:54:19.580
in slow motion, I'm going to hone into that

5760
03:54:19.580 --> 03:54:22.830
and I'm going to dodge through them and I'm going to get

5761
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:26.235
that first dick punch, because I did promise that.

5762
03:54:26.235 --> 03:54:28.040
You got to go for the dick.

5763
03:54:28.040 --> 03:54:31.390
Then I'm going to go stunning palm,

5764
03:54:31.390 --> 03:54:33.960
right through his sternum, and I'm going to feel his sternum

5765
03:54:33.960 --> 03:54:36.710
like crack into his heart.

5766
03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:39.466
MATT: As you push through, the sternum cracks,

5767
03:54:39.466 --> 03:54:43.030
and the heavy leather that's been slashed through

5768
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:46.349
that marks its heavy armored hide gives away,

5769
03:54:46.349 --> 03:54:50.557
and your first pierces six, 10, to the elbow into the chest

5770
03:54:52.400 --> 03:54:54.827
and you can feel your hand reach some sort of like

5771
03:54:54.827 --> 03:54:59.390
(heartbeat) part of the interior of the chest.

5772
03:54:59.390 --> 03:55:00.734
MARISHA: And I rip it out!

5773
03:55:02.675 --> 03:55:04.783
MATT: It's about this big, by the way.

5774
03:55:04.783 --> 03:55:07.430
You have to like curve around and yank it out.

5775
03:55:07.430 --> 03:55:11.260
As you tear this black,

5776
03:55:11.260 --> 03:55:14.247
thick, demonic heart, you watch as all the various

5777
03:55:14.247 --> 03:55:17.160
veins and capillaries, all the attached,

5778
03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:19.180
it's like pulling the center of a computer

5779
03:55:19.180 --> 03:55:21.480
away from all the cables that hold it in place

5780
03:55:21.480 --> 03:55:26.400
and you're covered in steaming demon blood.

5781
03:55:26.400 --> 03:55:28.990
As you tear it out, the creature (groan) and immediately

5782
03:55:28.990 --> 03:55:32.210
the eyes lull, it falls back into the water.

5783
03:55:32.210 --> 03:55:36.240
(steam) As its blood hits it, it causes steam to rise up

5784
03:55:36.240 --> 03:55:37.550
and fill the space around you.

5785
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:39.640
The entire vicinity is obscured.

5786
03:55:39.640 --> 03:55:42.782
A few moments later (fading steam).

5787
03:55:42.782 --> 03:55:46.070
The steam slowly dissipates and you see the creature now

5788
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:49.330
just elements of its body visible above the surface.

5789
03:55:49.330 --> 03:55:53.090
Of the heated pool that is now still bubbling around him.

5790
03:55:53.090 --> 03:55:55.490
As you hold the demonic heart, now no longer pumping

5791
03:55:55.490 --> 03:55:57.800
in your hand, the size of a basketball.

5792
03:55:57.800 --> 03:56:00.382
MARISHA: You know, when I envisioned this in my head,

5793
03:56:00.382 --> 03:56:03.460
it was like a little bit more-- this is a little

5794
03:56:03.460 --> 03:56:05.630
awkward. I regret this.

5795
03:56:05.630 --> 03:56:06.790
TALIESIN: We're not out of this yet.

5796
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:08.130
There's woods there.

5797
03:56:08.130 --> 03:56:10.150
LAURA: We're still in the initiative order?

5798
03:56:10.150 --> 03:56:10.983
MATT: Yes we are.

5799
03:56:10.983 --> 03:56:11.970
That finishes your turn, Beau?

5800
03:56:11.970 --> 03:56:15.860
MARISHA: Yeah, I just lop the heart like that.

5801
03:56:15.860 --> 03:56:17.180
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: That is my turn.

5802
03:56:17.180 --> 03:56:18.304
MATT: That finishes your go.

5803
03:56:18.304 --> 03:56:19.677
Fjord, you're up.

5804
03:56:19.677 --> 03:56:21.030
TRAVIS: Oh, death saving throw, right?

5805
03:56:21.030 --> 03:56:22.540
MATT: Death saving throw, yeah.

5806
03:56:22.540 --> 03:56:24.430
SAM: Are you down one?
TRAVIS: Yep.

5807
03:56:24.430 --> 03:56:25.720
LAURA: Oh, he is.
TRAVIS: Success.

5808
03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:26.820
MATT: Success, there you go.

5809
03:56:26.820 --> 03:56:28.249
TALIESIN: Cool beans, cool beans.

5810
03:56:28.249 --> 03:56:29.440
MATT: All right, Yasha's go.

5811
03:56:29.440 --> 03:56:31.820
Yasha, since he is now gone.

5812
03:56:32.660 --> 03:56:34.430
This stone has fallen over.

5813
03:56:34.430 --> 03:56:35.870
LAURA: Get the fuck out of here.

5814
03:56:35.870 --> 03:56:38.950
MATT: He is.
SAM: He don't got nothing.

5815
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:40.590
LAURA: Maybe he does.

5816
03:56:40.590 --> 03:56:42.030
MATT: There we go.
LAURA: He's got things

5817
03:56:42.030 --> 03:56:43.707
on his wrists that he slammed together.

5818
03:56:43.707 --> 03:56:45.307
SAM: That's true. That's true.

5819
03:56:45.307 --> 03:56:47.420
TALIESIN: That motherfucker, that motherfucker.

5820
03:56:47.420 --> 03:56:49.610
MATT: Yasha's going to turn this way.

5821
03:56:51.105 --> 03:56:51.938
Five, 10.

5822
03:56:53.775 --> 03:56:54.730
40.

5823
03:56:57.810 --> 03:56:59.960
Can't quite get close enough.

5824
03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:02.074
Instead going to move over this way to prevent it from

5825
03:57:02.074 --> 03:57:04.382
flying overhead. She's going to crawl up

5826
03:57:04.382 --> 03:57:06.549
on top of this space

5827
03:57:06.549 --> 03:57:08.430
to occupy the vicinity, so if it tries

5828
03:57:08.430 --> 03:57:11.050
to fly past, she'll--
LAURA: Doesn't Yasha have some

5829
03:57:11.050 --> 03:57:12.230
like healing ability?

5830
03:57:13.220 --> 03:57:14.520
That she could do for Caleb?
MATT: That's true.

5831
03:57:14.520 --> 03:57:16.660
LAURA: I mean, for Caduceus.

5832
03:57:16.660 --> 03:57:17.820
MATT: For Caduceus, yeah.

5833
03:57:17.820 --> 03:57:19.009
TRAVIS: Yeah, she has--

5834
03:57:19.009 --> 03:57:20.042
LAURA: She has Lay on Hands or something?

5835
03:57:20.042 --> 03:57:22.340
TALIESIN: She does.
TRAVIS: She has...

5836
03:57:22.340 --> 03:57:23.781
Healing Hands.
MATT: She can't get close

5837
03:57:23.781 --> 03:57:25.490
enough to do it, though, unfortunately.

5838
03:57:25.490 --> 03:57:28.670
TALIESIN: Also could have passed by Fjord, though.

5839
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:29.636
MATT: That's true.

5840
03:57:29.636 --> 03:57:31.176
Yeah, Fjord's on the ground, so instead,

5841
03:57:31.176 --> 03:57:32.222
Yasha will go ahead and move by

5842
03:57:32.222 --> 03:57:33.755
and use healing hands on Fjord.

5843
03:57:34.610 --> 03:57:36.030
TRAVIS: Thank you.

5844
03:57:36.030 --> 03:57:37.701
MATT: Go ahead and add that healing to yourself.

5845
03:57:37.701 --> 03:57:38.876
I think, is it her level?

5846
03:57:38.876 --> 03:57:40.147
TRAVIS: It's just eight points.

5847
03:57:40.147 --> 03:57:40.980
MATT: Eight points, so yeah.

5848
03:57:40.980 --> 03:57:41.813
That would be her level.

5849
03:57:41.813 --> 03:57:43.290
You heal eight points. You are no longer

5850
03:57:43.290 --> 03:57:45.260
making death saves. Yasha's turn is done.

5851
03:57:45.260 --> 03:57:47.500
Nott, you're up.
SAM: Oh, me?

5852
03:57:47.500 --> 03:57:49.623
Oh gosh, oh golly.

5853
03:57:49.623 --> 03:57:51.114
Oh by gosh, by golly.

5854
03:57:51.114 --> 03:57:51.947
LAURA: Is he still ethereal or--?

5855
03:57:51.947 --> 03:57:53.490
No, he's solid now.
MATT: No, he's solid now.

5856
03:57:53.490 --> 03:57:56.440
Because he tried to charm Beau.

5857
03:57:56.440 --> 03:57:58.915
SAM: Okay, I will run over closer,

5858
03:57:58.915 --> 03:58:00.948
find something to hide behind.

5859
03:58:00.948 --> 03:58:02.300
MATT: Over here would probably be your best bet

5860
03:58:02.300 --> 03:58:03.350
or over here. It's up to you.

5861
03:58:03.350 --> 03:58:04.860
SAM: Bonus action hide.

5862
03:58:04.860 --> 03:58:07.160
Hold action to shoot.
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

5863
03:58:10.400 --> 03:58:12.028
SAM: Advantage because the cloak?

5864
03:58:12.028 --> 03:58:13.350
MATT: Yep. Always an advantage with the cloak.

5865
03:58:13.350 --> 03:58:16.234
SAM: Natural 20.
MATT: Oh, yeah.

5866
03:58:16.234 --> 03:58:18.500
You step over there and just--

5867
03:58:18.500 --> 03:58:20.770
SAM: I throw a piece of rock to distract or something.

5868
03:58:20.770 --> 03:58:23.350
MATT: All right, that finishes your go.

5869
03:58:23.350 --> 03:58:24.740
You're holding your action to--

5870
03:58:24.740 --> 03:58:29.222
SAM: To fire a crossbow, loading explosive arrow,

5871
03:58:29.222 --> 03:58:32.360
getting ready to fire.
MATT: All righty.

5872
03:58:32.360 --> 03:58:33.490
That brings us to...

5873
03:58:34.367 --> 03:58:36.950
Jester's go. Jester, you're up.

5874
03:58:37.953 --> 03:58:39.430
SAM: Until they're like in combat.

5875
03:58:39.430 --> 03:58:42.213
In melee with one of our people.

5876
03:58:42.213 --> 03:58:44.570
LAURA: I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon

5877
03:58:44.570 --> 03:58:45.490
and try to hit it.

5878
03:58:46.777 --> 03:58:48.750
MATT: 10, 15, 20, that gets you in range.

5879
03:58:48.750 --> 03:58:51.160
LAURA: 17 plus eight.
MATT: That definitely hits.

5880
03:58:51.160 --> 03:58:52.410
Go ahead and roll damage.

5881
03:58:54.060 --> 03:58:57.460
LAURA: D8. That's a one.

5882
03:58:58.410 --> 03:58:59.840
Plus what is it?

5883
03:59:01.284 --> 03:59:03.882
Plus five, yeah.

5884
03:59:03.882 --> 03:59:05.049
So six points.

5885
03:59:05.049 --> 03:59:08.060
MATT: Six points, bludgeoning damage, slams into it.

5886
03:59:08.060 --> 03:59:09.940
LAURA: I'm going to run forward.

5887
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:13.140
I guess I would have run forward before that.

5888
03:59:13.140 --> 03:59:15.630
MATT: That is as far as you can move to get there.

5889
03:59:15.630 --> 03:59:18.540
TRAVIS: I forgot about Relentless Endurance.

5890
03:59:18.540 --> 03:59:20.390
LAURA: I can't get all the way to you.

5891
03:59:20.390 --> 03:59:22.118
TALIESIN: No.

5892
03:59:22.118 --> 03:59:24.886
LAURA: I'm going to--

5893
03:59:24.886 --> 03:59:27.771
TALIESIN: That's okay. Do what you got to do.

5894
03:59:27.771 --> 03:59:30.755
Or, you know, take a voof or boof.

5895
03:59:30.755 --> 03:59:34.230
LAURA: Yeah, I'll boof a Guiding Bolt at it at first level.

5896
03:59:35.409 --> 03:59:36.242
MATT: You have another first level spell?

5897
03:59:36.242 --> 03:59:38.720
All righty, go ahead and roll for an attack.

5898
03:59:38.720 --> 03:59:41.000
TALIESIN: Hey!
LAURA: 19 plus eight.

5899
03:59:41.000 --> 03:59:42.386
MATT: Oh, yeah, that hits.

5900
03:59:42.386 --> 03:59:43.700
Go ahead and roll damage.
LAURA: 4D6.

5901
03:59:45.499 --> 03:59:47.300
Five, seven.

5902
03:59:49.470 --> 03:59:51.400
One, eight points.

5903
03:59:51.400 --> 03:59:53.120
MATT: Eight points of damage to it.

5904
03:59:53.120 --> 03:59:54.660
LAURA: With advantage, next person gets attack.

5905
03:59:54.660 --> 03:59:56.210
MATT: Next attack it has advantage.

5906
03:59:57.170 --> 03:59:58.003
All righty.

5907
04:00:01.888 --> 04:00:04.110
All right, it is now the creature's turn.

5908
04:00:04.110 --> 04:00:07.794
Who hasn't he gone for?

5909
04:00:07.794 --> 04:00:10.262
You're the one attacking it.

5910
04:00:11.430 --> 04:00:12.770
No, this one's already tried against you.

5911
04:00:12.770 --> 04:00:14.578
You've already resisted.

5912
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:18.870
SAM: Decisions, decisions.

5913
04:00:20.217 --> 04:00:24.667
(ominous music)

5914
04:00:25.671 --> 04:00:27.549
TRAVIS: I don't know.

5915
04:00:29.350 --> 04:00:32.290
MATT: No, this is a position where--

5916
04:00:32.290 --> 04:00:33.123
TRAVIS: If somebody resists against it,

5917
04:00:33.123 --> 04:00:33.970
it can't do it again?

5918
04:00:33.970 --> 04:00:35.270
MATT: It doesn't know where you are.

5919
04:00:36.370 --> 04:00:38.320
LAURA: Yay.
SAM: It can't try again

5920
04:00:38.320 --> 04:00:40.150
with someone that's already done?

5921
04:00:40.150 --> 04:00:41.330
MATT: It sees you all eyeing Caduceus.

5922
04:00:41.330 --> 04:00:43.730
It's going to go ahead and fly over.

5923
04:00:43.730 --> 04:00:44.860
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: It's going to make

5924
04:00:44.860 --> 04:00:46.010
it's attack against you.

5925
04:00:47.850 --> 04:00:50.470
That is going to be a 17 to hit.

5926
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:52.670
LAURA: He's unconscious.

5927
04:00:52.670 --> 04:00:53.630
TALIESIN: Yeah, that misses.

5928
04:00:54.540 --> 04:00:56.680
MATT: Oh, because you're unconscious, it's with advantage.

5929
04:00:57.570 --> 04:00:58.860
That brings it to a 19. Does that hit?

5930
04:00:58.860 --> 04:00:59.951
TALIESIN: That does hit.

5931
04:00:59.951 --> 04:01:01.284
MATT: All right, so you lose two death saving throws.

5932
04:01:01.284 --> 04:01:02.567
TALIESIN: Wait, if I'm unconscious,

5933
04:01:02.567 --> 04:01:03.525
I lose two death saving throws?

5934
04:01:03.525 --> 04:01:05.312
Okay, not already, okay.

5935
04:01:05.312 --> 04:01:07.600
LAURA: When he stabilized,

5936
04:01:07.600 --> 04:01:08.500
that started over.

5937
04:01:09.450 --> 04:01:11.708
MATT: Stabilized it goes, wait, hold on,

5938
04:01:11.708 --> 04:01:12.549
that's a good point.

5939
04:01:12.549 --> 04:01:15.364
SAM: Stabilized isn't alive, though, right?

5940
04:01:15.364 --> 04:01:17.200
It's just not dead.
TALIESIN: No, it's alive.

5941
04:01:17.200 --> 04:01:20.024
You're unconscious.
MARISHA: You don't have to

5942
04:01:20.024 --> 04:01:21.863
roll death saves anymore.

5943
04:01:21.863 --> 04:01:22.880
But you don't-- you're not conscious.

5944
04:01:22.880 --> 04:01:24.597
TALIESIN: You're also not--

5945
04:01:24.597 --> 04:01:25.430
MATT: Have you lost any previously?

5946
04:01:25.430 --> 04:01:28.340
TALIESIN: No, I'm even keel.
MATT: Right.

5947
04:01:28.340 --> 04:01:31.470
Then that would put you--
LAURA: Oh, okay.

5948
04:01:31.470 --> 04:01:32.970
It doesn't matter.

5949
04:01:32.970 --> 04:01:35.620
TALIESIN: Well, mean, it does, it does,

5950
04:01:35.620 --> 04:01:37.930
but you know, this is bad.

5951
04:01:37.930 --> 04:01:40.220
MATT: A stable creature doesn't make saving throws.

5952
04:01:41.170 --> 04:01:43.030
You don't make death saving throws,

5953
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:45.881
but you can still lose them.

5954
04:01:45.881 --> 04:01:48.098
You've lost two death saving throws.

5955
04:01:48.098 --> 04:01:50.176
TALIESIN: I'm two down, okay.
MATT: Yes.

5956
04:01:50.176 --> 04:01:51.675
TRAVIS: Back to oh shit.

5957
04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:54.180
MATT: That's its turn.

5958
04:01:54.180 --> 04:01:55.021
TALIESIN: Okay.

5959
04:01:55.021 --> 04:01:56.880
MATT: It's trying to take you out.

5960
04:01:56.880 --> 04:01:58.650
All right, that brings us to Caleb.

5961
04:01:59.530 --> 04:02:01.640
LIAM: Potions are a bonus action for us, right?

5962
04:02:01.640 --> 04:02:02.473
LIAM: For yourself, yes.

5963
04:02:02.473 --> 04:02:05.064
They're an action--
LIAM: For someone else?

5964
04:02:05.064 --> 04:02:08.340
LAURA: Can I use my turn to move as far close

5965
04:02:08.340 --> 04:02:10.010
to Caduceus as possible?

5966
04:02:10.010 --> 04:02:11.826
MATT: Sure.
SAM: Has the incubus

5967
04:02:11.826 --> 04:02:16.250
attacked Caduceus. Did that put it in melee with Caduceus?

5968
04:02:16.250 --> 04:02:18.400
MATT: Caduceus is not threatening it, so it wouldn't be

5969
04:02:18.400 --> 04:02:21.330
considered in melee.
SAM: Shit.

5970
04:02:21.330 --> 04:02:24.070
But because I'm so hidden, no, that doesn't matter.

5971
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:25.170
MATT: No.

5972
04:02:25.170 --> 04:02:26.590
Well, you don't know, it could.

5973
04:02:26.590 --> 04:02:28.585
If you think it doesn't see you.

5974
04:02:29.610 --> 04:02:31.250
The trigger you're waiting for is somebody

5975
04:02:31.250 --> 04:02:32.510
to get into melee, so.
SAM: Yeah.

5976
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:33.900
Because I didn't know if I hid.

5977
04:02:33.900 --> 04:02:34.970
MATT: You're waiting for somebody to get--

5978
04:02:34.970 --> 04:02:35.803
TALIESIN: Although seeing it hit me wouldn't

5979
04:02:35.803 --> 04:02:37.540
trigger, oh, no, no, no.

5980
04:02:37.540 --> 04:02:39.227
SAM: Yeah, I don't know.

5981
04:02:39.227 --> 04:02:40.200
MATT: I'll put it this way.

5982
04:02:40.200 --> 04:02:43.220
Would you consider it getting next to Caduceus,

5983
04:02:43.220 --> 04:02:46.114
waiting for it to get closer to a friend?

5984
04:02:46.114 --> 04:02:51.114
SAM: I was waiting for it to get within a position

5985
04:02:51.850 --> 04:02:54.420
where I could sneak attack, which, so far,

5986
04:02:54.420 --> 04:02:56.120
has been any time it's been engaged

5987
04:02:56.120 --> 04:02:57.180
with one of my friends.

5988
04:02:57.180 --> 04:02:59.983
MATT: Sure, I'll allow it.
SAM: Okay, I will fire.

5989
04:02:59.983 --> 04:03:01.850
At advantage.
MATT: At advantage,

5990
04:03:01.850 --> 04:03:02.683
because you're hidden.

5991
04:03:02.683 --> 04:03:04.520
You do not get sneak attack because he does not

5992
04:03:04.520 --> 04:03:06.474
threaten the creature even though he's an ally.

5993
04:03:06.474 --> 04:03:08.782
But you can sneak attack because it does not

5994
04:03:08.782 --> 04:03:10.950
know you're there because you were hidden from it.

5995
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:13.460
SAM: I get advantage, but not sneak attack damage.

5996
04:03:13.460 --> 04:03:15.610
MATT: You get sneak attack damage whenever you have

5997
04:03:15.610 --> 04:03:16.970
advantage on the strike.

5998
04:03:16.970 --> 04:03:19.390
Having it next to a friend is only useful

5999
04:03:19.390 --> 04:03:21.170
if you do not have advantage on the strike.

6000
04:03:21.170 --> 04:03:22.270
SAM: You would have had advantage anyway

6001
04:03:22.270 --> 04:03:24.050
because of the last time it got hit was.

6002
04:03:24.050 --> 04:03:26.320
MATT: Guiding bolts, you're fine.

6003
04:03:26.320 --> 04:03:29.300
LAURA: Sneak attack.
SAM: 23.

6004
04:03:31.004 --> 04:03:32.654
25.

6005
04:03:32.654 --> 04:03:33.487
Something like that.

6006
04:03:33.487 --> 04:03:34.320
MATT: How do you want to do this?

6007
04:03:34.320 --> 04:03:35.930
LAURA: Wait, no, he hasn't rolled advantage yet.

6008
04:03:35.930 --> 04:03:37.150
MATT: I know.

6009
04:03:38.160 --> 04:03:41.570
You didn't--
SAM: It's 20 or something.

6010
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:44.236
MATT: Yeah, how do you want to do this?

6011
04:03:44.236 --> 04:03:46.740
LAURA: Oh my god.

6012
04:03:46.740 --> 04:03:48.070
SAM: How would I like to do this?

6013
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:50.070
It's an explosive arrow.

6014
04:03:52.617 --> 04:03:54.200
Oh no.

6015
04:03:56.092 --> 04:03:58.260
MATT: Okay, okay.
SAM: Oh no.

6016
04:03:58.260 --> 04:03:59.720
MATT: So.
SAM: Oh no.

6017
04:03:59.720 --> 04:04:01.810
MATT: So.
SAM: Oh no.

6018
04:04:01.810 --> 04:04:05.450
MATT: As you see it rush past the friend, you fire,

6019
04:04:05.450 --> 04:04:10.110
and the bolt strikes towards it and detonates.

6020
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:12.240
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: You watch as portions of

6021
04:04:12.240 --> 04:04:16.040
the incubus are scattered across the ceiling,

6022
04:04:16.040 --> 04:04:17.949
the walls, the floors.

6023
04:04:17.949 --> 04:04:20.510
SAM: I celebrate.
MATT: Dripping down.

6024
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:22.130
You celebrate like, "Yeah!"

6025
04:04:22.130 --> 04:04:25.020
And all you see is like the body of Caduceus,

6026
04:04:25.020 --> 04:04:27.570
which is thrown about five or six feet from the explosion

6027
04:04:27.570 --> 04:04:32.570
land on the ground, charred and dead.

6028
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:34.490
LAURA: No!

6029
04:04:34.490 --> 04:04:35.380
I run forward.

6030
04:04:36.440 --> 04:04:37.840
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I cast Revivify.

6031
04:04:37.840 --> 04:04:38.673
MATT: You still have--?

6032
04:04:38.673 --> 04:04:39.648
LAURA: I have a third level left

6033
04:04:39.648 --> 04:04:42.429
because I have my Pearl of fucking Power!

6034
04:04:43.271 --> 04:04:45.238
MATT: Okay. All right, yeah. Combat's over.

6035
04:04:45.238 --> 04:04:47.690
You go ahead and you pull out the diamond

6036
04:04:47.690 --> 04:04:50.320
that you thankfully--
LAURA: Got back.

6037
04:04:50.320 --> 04:04:53.710
MATT: Thankfully, that ogre didn't win that fight.

6038
04:04:53.710 --> 04:04:55.380
Or anybody else.
SAM: Oh my god.

6039
04:04:55.380 --> 04:04:57.751
Is this a thing she has to roll for?

6040
04:04:57.751 --> 04:04:59.890
MATT: No, no.

6041
04:04:59.890 --> 04:05:01.420
It's within one minute.

6042
04:05:01.420 --> 04:05:05.450
As you see Caduceus burned, eyes partially open,

6043
04:05:05.450 --> 04:05:09.700
the final breath escape the body, (thud) onto the stone.

6044
04:05:09.700 --> 04:05:11.420
You rush forward, pull out the diamond.

6045
04:05:11.420 --> 04:05:14.086
LAURA: Traveler, tell the wild mother

6046
04:05:14.086 --> 04:05:16.602
that Caduceus needs help.

6047
04:05:17.950 --> 04:05:20.810
I place the diamond on his chest and I cast Revivify.

6048
04:05:20.810 --> 04:05:21.643
MATT: Okay.

6049
04:05:21.643 --> 04:05:24.790
As you cast the spell, the diamond shatters in place

6050
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:29.790
into thousands of tiny, sparkling glittering beads of light.

6051
04:05:30.290 --> 04:05:33.860
They all stop in place and float above him.

6052
04:05:35.370 --> 04:05:37.860
As your hand's out in front, you see a second hand appear.

6053
04:05:37.860 --> 04:05:39.330
Spectral, green.

6054
04:05:40.680 --> 04:05:42.710
You see a cloaked arm around it.

6055
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:45.028
The Traveler's hand is with you.

6056
04:05:45.028 --> 04:05:47.690
He pushes your hand forward into this series

6057
04:05:47.690 --> 04:05:49.330
of sparkles, and it's warm to the touch,

6058
04:05:49.330 --> 04:05:52.500
and you watch as they all gather around your hand.

6059
04:05:52.500 --> 04:05:55.090
For just an instant, for just an instant,

6060
04:05:55.090 --> 04:05:59.731
you feel this presence

6061
04:05:59.731 --> 04:06:02.981
and you swear amongst the shadows

6062
04:06:02.981 --> 04:06:04.450
for a split second, you can see

6063
04:06:04.450 --> 04:06:09.120
this heavy tumbling hair and a matronly smile.

6064
04:06:09.120 --> 04:06:12.312
In the shadow above, but you blink and it's gone.

6065
04:06:12.312 --> 04:06:15.651
As you look down, the energy that's around your hand

6066
04:06:15.651 --> 04:06:18.660
drifts into Caduceus's chest.

6067
04:06:19.944 --> 04:06:21.730
You see all the sparkling bits of light

6068
04:06:21.730 --> 04:06:23.300
all going out, hundreds at a time,

6069
04:06:23.300 --> 04:06:25.850
before all of them have transitioned into his body.

6070
04:06:27.780 --> 04:06:28.613
There's a pause.

6071
04:06:31.320 --> 04:06:33.910
The voice in your ear, a familiar voice says,

6072
04:06:36.102 --> 04:06:36.935
"I'm proud of you."

6073
04:06:38.368 --> 04:06:39.210
"(gasps)"

6074
04:06:39.210 --> 04:06:41.355
TALIESIN: (snoring)

6075
04:06:41.355 --> 04:06:42.766
(laughter)

6076
04:06:42.766 --> 04:06:44.558
LAURA: (whispering) Caduceus! Hey!

6077
04:06:44.558 --> 04:06:47.049
TALIESIN: Am I even at one hit point?

6078
04:06:47.049 --> 04:06:48.290
MATT: You're at one hit point.

6079
04:06:48.290 --> 04:06:51.767
LIAM: "That's nice."
TALIESIN: Is it over?

6080
04:06:51.767 --> 04:06:54.960
Oh, that doesn't feel good, oh.

6081
04:06:54.960 --> 04:06:55.793
LAURA: I'm sorry.

6082
04:06:57.018 --> 04:06:58.726
TALIESIN: I had the weirdest dream.

6083
04:06:58.726 --> 04:07:00.000
Oh, oh, that's stiff.

6084
04:07:00.000 --> 04:07:01.700
LAURA: You'll never believe what I saw.

6085
04:07:01.700 --> 04:07:04.330
TALIESIN: What did you see?
LAURA: I saw your Wildmother.

6086
04:07:04.330 --> 04:07:07.040
She was looking over you and smiling.

6087
04:07:07.040 --> 04:07:10.895
TALIESIN: That is, I'm going to sleep-- that's good.

6088
04:07:11.772 --> 04:07:14.370
LAURA: He should probably sleep. He needs some rest, though.

6089
04:07:14.370 --> 04:07:18.332
TRAVIS: I think we all need some rest, and I sit up.

6090
04:07:18.332 --> 04:07:20.990
(laughter)

6091
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:22.281
TALIESIN: Is it over?

6092
04:07:23.810 --> 04:07:24.643
Hey.

6093
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:28.940
MARISHA: Hey, Caddyshack.
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow.

6094
04:07:28.940 --> 04:07:31.670
MATT: You had this strange vision in the darkness.

6095
04:07:32.900 --> 04:07:34.091
You saw fields.

6096
04:07:35.150 --> 04:07:36.440
Beautiful, distant.

6097
04:07:36.440 --> 04:07:40.240
You saw ice covered lands.

6098
04:07:40.240 --> 04:07:42.030
You saw a fiery forge.

6099
04:07:43.800 --> 04:07:46.810
You saw historical glimpses of different families

6100
04:07:46.810 --> 04:07:48.210
out there, scattered.

6101
04:07:49.720 --> 04:07:51.505
Warm breeze blew through.

6102
04:07:54.284 --> 04:07:55.534
The breeze blew east.

6103
04:07:57.020 --> 04:07:59.480
Past the mountains, past the wastes.

6104
04:08:01.211 --> 04:08:03.161
You feel like you're on the right path.

6105
04:08:04.095 --> 04:08:05.750
You can't explain it.

6106
04:08:07.850 --> 04:08:09.350
TALIESIN: Well, that was invigorating.

6107
04:08:10.691 --> 04:08:13.930
Let's take a few minutes.

6108
04:08:13.930 --> 04:08:14.763
LAURA: Yeah.

6109
04:08:14.763 --> 04:08:16.805
TALIESIN: I think I got something left.

6110
04:08:20.733 --> 04:08:23.772
LAURA: You guys, we did it.

6111
04:08:24.860 --> 04:08:25.693
SAM: Perfect plan.

6112
04:08:27.627 --> 04:08:28.468
MARISHA: Nailed it.

6113
04:08:28.468 --> 04:08:30.500
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit up and start

6114
04:08:30.500 --> 04:08:32.110
Prayer of Healing for everybody.

6115
04:08:34.440 --> 04:08:35.273
MATT: All righty.

6116
04:08:37.900 --> 04:08:39.425
TALIESIN: For the way out, so we're not--

6117
04:08:39.425 --> 04:08:40.850
SAM: So many deaths.

6118
04:08:40.850 --> 04:08:42.510
MARISHA: So many healing potions.

6119
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:45.560
TALIESIN: That's going to be 15 points for everybody,

6120
04:08:45.560 --> 04:08:47.200
but it's going to take a few minutes.

6121
04:08:47.200 --> 04:08:51.099
LIAM: Caleb's looking like Dragon Age blood effect on max.

6122
04:08:51.099 --> 04:08:55.057
(laughter)

6123
04:08:55.057 --> 04:08:56.397
MATT: That's the best reference.

6124
04:08:56.397 --> 04:08:58.078
TRAVIS: Perfect ref.

6125
04:08:58.078 --> 04:09:02.610
LIAM: Staggers towards the body of the fuckboy fellow

6126
04:09:02.610 --> 04:09:07.100
and I'm going to loot the shit out of that pile of meat.

6127
04:09:07.100 --> 04:09:08.939
MATT: Which one, the big one?
SAM: The incubus or?

6128
04:09:08.939 --> 04:09:10.930
LIAM: No, this one. I'm going to see if there's anything

6129
04:09:10.930 --> 04:09:13.837
on this fucking thing, covered in gore.

6130
04:09:13.837 --> 04:09:15.537
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

6131
04:09:17.483 --> 04:09:19.849
TALIESIN: Need more diamonds.

6132
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:21.083
SAM: I'll go to the succubus

6133
04:09:21.083 --> 04:09:23.940
or whatever one over there.

6134
04:09:25.917 --> 04:09:27.550
MATT: Make an investigation check.

6135
04:09:27.550 --> 04:09:28.383
LIAM: 21.

6136
04:09:28.383 --> 04:09:30.493
MATT: Okay.
SAM: 26.

6137
04:09:30.493 --> 04:09:31.726
MATT: 26.

6138
04:09:33.659 --> 04:09:38.340
On the incubus, you find not a lot of,

6139
04:09:38.340 --> 04:09:42.403
not much to carry, doesn't seem to have, really, pockets.

6140
04:09:42.403 --> 04:09:45.230
Except for like a small pouch, where you see contains

6141
04:09:45.230 --> 04:09:46.790
20 pieces of platinum.

6142
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:48.635
TALIESIN: Hey!

6143
04:09:48.635 --> 04:09:52.080
MATT: A rainy day fund in case this incubus, I guess,

6144
04:09:52.080 --> 04:09:54.180
needed to bribe its way through something.

6145
04:09:55.030 --> 04:10:00.030
On the succubus, you come across-- there is

6146
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:04.290
a series of sheets that are rolled together like parchment.

6147
04:10:04.290 --> 04:10:06.970
All of which are very, you think they're parchment,

6148
04:10:06.970 --> 04:10:08.740
at first, and as you grab them,

6149
04:10:08.740 --> 04:10:11.050
they are leather, they are like made of

6150
04:10:11.050 --> 04:10:13.170
some creature's hide that has been tanned.

6151
04:10:13.170 --> 04:10:15.820
They have a really, scaled texture to it.

6152
04:10:16.780 --> 04:10:20.590
Like a heavy callous, almost, that's curled

6153
04:10:20.590 --> 04:10:22.850
and pushed until it's become flexible.

6154
04:10:23.900 --> 04:10:26.140
But it is bound with a heavy piece of cord.

6155
04:10:27.680 --> 04:10:28.513
Closed.

6156
04:10:28.513 --> 04:10:31.267
Like, you manage to rummage and pull it out of

6157
04:10:31.267 --> 04:10:34.230
a small case that's attached to it.

6158
04:10:34.230 --> 04:10:35.650
SAM: Can I open it up?
MATT: Yeah.

6159
04:10:35.650 --> 04:10:36.641
SAM: Okay.

6160
04:10:36.641 --> 04:10:41.560
MATT: It looks like a language you don't understand.

6161
04:10:41.560 --> 04:10:43.180
I believe, what languages do you know?

6162
04:10:43.180 --> 04:10:44.321
SAM: Just Goblin, Common, and Halfling.

6163
04:10:44.321 --> 04:10:45.679
MATT: Yeah, you don't understand this language.

6164
04:10:45.679 --> 04:10:47.846
However, you do-- actually, no,

6165
04:10:47.846 --> 04:10:49.962
you don't recognize this at all.

6166
04:10:49.962 --> 04:10:51.400
SAM: It's just a language.

6167
04:10:51.400 --> 04:10:53.190
MATT: It's script.

6168
04:10:53.190 --> 04:10:54.710
It looks like a language and there's some

6169
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:56.563
small sketches and schematics on it.

6170
04:10:56.563 --> 04:10:57.396
SAM: I'll just pocket that.

6171
04:10:57.396 --> 04:10:59.512
MATT: Okay. You rolled?

6172
04:10:59.512 --> 04:11:00.946
LAURA: I didn't roll yet.

6173
04:11:00.946 --> 04:11:04.222
MATT: Oh, roll investigation check for me.

6174
04:11:04.222 --> 04:11:07.560
LAURA: (chuckles) He's a big demon-y guy.

6175
04:11:07.560 --> 04:11:09.990
MATT: Yeah, underwater, mostly.

6176
04:11:09.990 --> 04:11:13.160
LAURA: I rolled a four. I was mostly looking for

6177
04:11:13.160 --> 04:11:14.730
his wrist things, anyway.

6178
04:11:14.730 --> 04:11:16.120
MATT: Okay, yeah, you don't find much on him.

6179
04:11:16.120 --> 04:11:21.120
However, there are these heavy gloves.

6180
04:11:21.195 --> 04:11:24.780
They stop beneath the fingers this way,

6181
04:11:24.780 --> 04:11:27.370
and they have gauntlet plates above the guard,

6182
04:11:27.370 --> 04:11:29.060
in place of the claws of the creature would come through.

6183
04:11:29.060 --> 04:11:31.580
You see these like metal studs across each knuckle,

6184
04:11:31.580 --> 04:11:33.280
and are organized across the back of the hand,

6185
04:11:33.280 --> 04:11:35.890
where it seems that electrical charge was gathered.

6186
04:11:35.890 --> 04:11:38.210
They end at the wrist, and there's a little bit

6187
04:11:38.210 --> 04:11:39.510
of overlap there.

6188
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:41.730
They're massive, and you peel them off the creature,

6189
04:11:41.730 --> 04:11:43.000
and they're still covered in its own blood,

6190
04:11:43.000 --> 04:11:46.980
and they smell like an electrical fire.

6191
04:11:46.980 --> 04:11:50.060
Similar to the arcing, the smell that you

6192
04:11:50.060 --> 04:11:53.640
heard with each thrust of the electrical lance

6193
04:11:53.640 --> 04:11:55.980
that it flung earlier.

6194
04:11:55.980 --> 04:11:57.890
Yeah, it's fun.

6195
04:11:57.890 --> 04:11:59.790
LAURA: If I put it on, does it seem to shrink down

6196
04:11:59.790 --> 04:12:01.610
to my hand size?

6197
04:12:01.610 --> 04:12:04.150
MATT: If you put it on, no, it's floppy.

6198
04:12:04.150 --> 04:12:05.616
LAURA: These are really big,

6199
04:12:05.616 --> 04:12:07.080
but they have lightning in them.

6200
04:12:07.080 --> 04:12:10.360
MATT: The thickness of the hide, you're not quite sure

6201
04:12:10.360 --> 04:12:15.040
what the nature of the construction of them are.

6202
04:12:15.040 --> 04:12:15.873
LAURA: Fjord, do you want to put these

6203
04:12:15.873 --> 04:12:16.706
in the bag of holding?

6204
04:12:16.706 --> 04:12:17.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure, I'll take it.

6205
04:12:17.980 --> 04:12:19.882
If bet you sat down and really thought about them a bunch,

6206
04:12:19.882 --> 04:12:21.224
they might change.

6207
04:12:21.224 --> 04:12:23.447
LAURA: I don't have the ability to do that.

6208
04:12:23.447 --> 04:12:24.280
TRAVIS: They go in the bag of holding.

6209
04:12:24.280 --> 04:12:26.371
LAURA: You should put the big ugly heart

6210
04:12:26.371 --> 04:12:29.236
in the bag of holding, too, so we can show it for evidence.

6211
04:12:29.236 --> 04:12:31.011
MARISHA: I was thinking that, too.

6212
04:12:31.011 --> 04:12:32.580
LAURA: You don't want to take his head?

6213
04:12:32.580 --> 04:12:33.413
TALIESIN: Heads are nice.

6214
04:12:33.413 --> 04:12:36.382
LAURA: His head is bigger than his heart.

6215
04:12:36.382 --> 04:12:39.073
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind sawing it off right now.

6216
04:12:39.073 --> 04:12:40.023
LAURA: I'm okay with that.

6217
04:12:40.023 --> 04:12:42.098
MARISHA: Maybe a couple horns.

6218
04:12:42.098 --> 04:12:43.894
LAURA: Let's just chop his head off.

6219
04:12:43.894 --> 04:12:48.260
MARISHA: Okay, I'll help like grab the horns

6220
04:12:48.260 --> 04:12:49.770
and position it so--

6221
04:12:49.770 --> 04:12:51.770
MATT: I'll say with Yasha's help, the three of you

6222
04:12:51.770 --> 04:12:56.240
manage to slowly move it out of the pool of stagnant water.

6223
04:12:56.240 --> 04:12:58.470
This is a heavy motherfucker.

6224
04:12:58.470 --> 04:13:00.650
I'd say probably takes all of you, for the most part,

6225
04:13:00.650 --> 04:13:03.980
to try and get it out over the next like ten minutes or so.

6226
04:13:03.980 --> 04:13:05.910
You manage to get the body out of the water,

6227
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:07.570
because it's soaked now.

6228
04:13:07.570 --> 04:13:09.190
Pull it through.

6229
04:13:09.190 --> 04:13:11.340
Takes you a long time to saw through.

6230
04:13:11.340 --> 04:13:15.530
It's a ghastly process, but you manage to

6231
04:13:15.530 --> 04:13:16.980
remove the head.

6232
04:13:16.980 --> 04:13:19.300
The head in its own right weighs, I'd say,

6233
04:13:19.300 --> 04:13:22.125
close to like 300 pounds.

6234
04:13:22.125 --> 04:13:24.543
LAURA and SAM: Ooh!

6235
04:13:24.543 --> 04:13:26.790
TRAVIS: Holy shit.
LAURA: That's a lot of head.

6236
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:28.698
MARISHA: So much head.

6237
04:13:28.698 --> 04:13:31.510
SAM: Just do one of those rubbings. Just do a rubbing.

6238
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:33.626
TALIESIN: We can tell them where to find it.

6239
04:13:33.626 --> 04:13:34.934
LAURA: Maybe we just bring the heart with us.

6240
04:13:34.934 --> 04:13:35.767
TRAVIS: Yeah, the heart sounds good.

6241
04:13:35.767 --> 04:13:37.433
LAURA: Because, you know, what are they going to do?

6242
04:13:37.433 --> 04:13:39.630
They're going to stay down here, we closed the rift.

6243
04:13:39.630 --> 04:13:42.270
LIAM: From the body of the incubus, Caleb would see

6244
04:13:42.270 --> 04:13:44.620
the succubus that got curb stomped by Beauregard,

6245
04:13:44.620 --> 04:13:47.980
so I'm going to rifle its body. Oh, you did that already?

6246
04:13:47.980 --> 04:13:49.413
SAM: I did the succubus.

6247
04:13:49.413 --> 04:13:51.801
MATT: Yeah, you guys have already looked through all them.

6248
04:13:51.801 --> 04:13:53.009
LAURA: We should probably rest, you guys.

6249
04:13:53.009 --> 04:13:53.959
MARISHA: I'm so tired.

6250
04:13:53.959 --> 04:13:55.267
SAM: Right here?

6251
04:13:55.267 --> 04:13:56.883
LAURA: Nothing else can come out.

6252
04:13:56.883 --> 04:13:59.270
We closed the rift, I think.

6253
04:13:59.270 --> 04:14:01.730
MARISHA: I wonder what time it is. What time is it?

6254
04:14:01.730 --> 04:14:03.311
LIAM: It is--

6255
04:14:04.497 --> 04:14:05.413
MATT: Time right now?

6256
04:14:05.413 --> 04:14:08.960
You'd guess, based on the middle of the night,

6257
04:14:08.960 --> 04:14:12.293
when you guys traversed down here, rest in-between,

6258
04:14:12.293 --> 04:14:15.502
I'd say it's probably close to dawn.

6259
04:14:15.502 --> 04:14:19.338
LIAM: Well, I can throw up the dome down here, if we want.

6260
04:14:19.338 --> 04:14:22.672
LAURA: Maybe we can sleep and then we'll go see Lady Oreos.

6261
04:14:22.672 --> 04:14:24.400
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.
SAM Okay.

6262
04:14:24.400 --> 04:14:25.474
TALIESIN: Sleep good.

6263
04:14:25.474 --> 04:14:26.608
MATT: Where are you setting up?

6264
04:14:26.608 --> 04:14:28.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, should we search

6265
04:14:28.040 --> 04:14:30.130
the cave just for anything else that was dropped

6266
04:14:30.130 --> 04:14:31.810
or any of the other markings that it--

6267
04:14:31.810 --> 04:14:33.871
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to look around.

6268
04:14:33.871 --> 04:14:35.635
TRAVIS: Since we saw the little creatures

6269
04:14:35.635 --> 04:14:36.935
scratching into the surface and stuff.

6270
04:14:36.935 --> 04:14:39.390
TALIESIN: I'm going to take in the view.

6271
04:14:39.390 --> 04:14:40.457
MATT: Okay, so two people can do this.

6272
04:14:40.457 --> 04:14:42.123
You can choose either investigation or perception.

6273
04:14:42.123 --> 04:14:43.574
TALIESIN: I'll take perception.

6274
04:14:43.574 --> 04:14:45.251
TRAVIS: I'll take investigation.

6275
04:14:45.251 --> 04:14:47.272
MATT: All right, go for it, the two of you.

6276
04:14:47.272 --> 04:14:49.863
TALIESIN: How about a good roll? There you go. 26.

6277
04:14:49.863 --> 04:14:51.413
MATT: 26, nice.

6278
04:14:51.413 --> 04:14:52.446
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

6279
04:14:52.446 --> 04:14:53.979
MARISHA: Holy shit.

6280
04:14:53.979 --> 04:14:55.412
LAURA: It's coming back.

6281
04:14:55.412 --> 04:14:58.762
(singing) It's all coming back to us now!

6282
04:14:58.762 --> 04:15:00.450
TALIESIN: Where were you?

6283
04:15:00.450 --> 04:15:04.440
MATT: The two of you, at almost the exact same time,

6284
04:15:04.440 --> 04:15:07.740
in the far corner, hidden amongst the stacks

6285
04:15:07.740 --> 04:15:10.273
of stalagmites that litter the floor,

6286
04:15:10.273 --> 04:15:14.630
you see this faint little orangish glow.

6287
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:18.700
It's ever so faint amongst the darkness in the far corner.

6288
04:15:18.700 --> 04:15:21.620
You both approach and tucked and hidden

6289
04:15:21.620 --> 04:15:24.860
with dirt placed over it, only slightly ever exposed,

6290
04:15:24.860 --> 04:15:26.570
there's an object.

6291
04:15:26.570 --> 04:15:29.930
There's just this ever so faint orange glow.

6292
04:15:29.930 --> 04:15:33.100
Looks like it's a little bit exposed to glass or something.

6293
04:15:33.100 --> 04:15:36.480
TRAVIS: You see that?
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's weird.

6294
04:15:36.480 --> 04:15:40.063
TRAVIS: You want to give it a little touch with your staff?

6295
04:15:43.514 --> 04:15:46.560
LAURA: Should you make sure it's okay first? (pigeon coo)

6296
04:15:46.560 --> 04:15:47.980
TRAVIS: We're poking it.

6297
04:15:47.980 --> 04:15:49.920
TALIESIN: Let's have everyone pay attention to this

6298
04:15:49.920 --> 04:15:53.487
for a moment, I think that might not be a bad idea.

6299
04:15:53.487 --> 04:15:56.070
LAURA: What'd you find?

6300
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:59.540
TALIESIN: Want to try and identify it before we touch it?

6301
04:15:59.540 --> 04:16:02.810
SAM: Caleb, is that a thing you can do?

6302
04:16:02.810 --> 04:16:05.810
LAURA: No! No, Fjord, remember.

6303
04:16:05.810 --> 04:16:08.218
MARISHA: Remember the Ruby.

6304
04:16:08.218 --> 04:16:10.359
LIAM: I can. It'll take some time.

6305
04:16:10.359 --> 04:16:12.309
LAURA: Like what? Like ten minutes?

6306
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:13.142
LIAM: Yeah.

6307
04:16:13.142 --> 04:16:14.233
SAM: Yeah, we can wait ten minutes.

6308
04:16:14.233 --> 04:16:16.610
LAURA: Yeah, let's check it out before we touch this thing.

6309
04:16:16.610 --> 04:16:19.745
SAM: He's going to ritually Identify.

6310
04:16:19.745 --> 04:16:21.958
MATT: Identifying what?
TALIESIN: The object.

6311
04:16:21.958 --> 04:16:24.000
MATT: The object?
LIAM: Yeah.

6312
04:16:24.000 --> 04:16:25.560
MATT: You're picking it up and handling it?

6313
04:16:25.560 --> 04:16:27.690
LIAM: No, I will sit down next to it and draw a circle

6314
04:16:27.690 --> 04:16:30.350
around it and start to attempt to identify it.

6315
04:16:30.350 --> 04:16:31.183
MATT: Okay.

6316
04:16:31.183 --> 04:16:33.241
TALIESIN: I'm also give you Resistance.

6317
04:16:33.241 --> 04:16:34.249
LIAM: Ten-ish minutes.

6318
04:16:34.249 --> 04:16:35.550
MATT: All righty.

6319
04:16:35.550 --> 04:16:39.092
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep you up with Resistance, too.

6320
04:16:40.700 --> 04:16:42.530
TRAVIS: Should we blow some of the dirt off of it,

6321
04:16:42.530 --> 04:16:45.240
See what it is? it's a little covered in dirt.

6322
04:16:45.240 --> 04:16:47.190
MATT: You take ten minutes to focus.

6323
04:16:47.190 --> 04:16:49.370
Even though it's mostly buried, as you concentrate

6324
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:51.888
on the spell, the information comes to you,

6325
04:16:51.888 --> 04:16:53.750
and you can see, in your mind's eye, the full structure.

6326
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:57.590
It's a small disc-like piece of silver.

6327
04:16:57.590 --> 04:17:00.130
A silver disc, about that wide.

6328
04:17:00.130 --> 04:17:02.550
That contains a three-inch glass sphere,

6329
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:06.108
filled with mercury that rests on the top.

6330
04:17:06.108 --> 04:17:09.120
The glass that you see peeking through

6331
04:17:09.120 --> 04:17:11.890
is that sphere and the orange color

6332
04:17:11.890 --> 04:17:13.700
is coming from the mercury itself

6333
04:17:13.700 --> 04:17:17.238
being the catalyst to some sort of arcane enchantment

6334
04:17:17.238 --> 04:17:20.713
that rests within the disc around it.

6335
04:17:20.713 --> 04:17:21.970
Sigils adorn it in

6336
04:17:21.970 --> 04:17:25.960
a rudimentary circle based around the orb.

6337
04:17:25.960 --> 04:17:28.520
With four pieces of rough pink crystal,

6338
04:17:28.520 --> 04:17:30.020
wrapped in copper coils.

6339
04:17:30.020 --> 04:17:33.350
That are placed at the edges of this disc.

6340
04:17:33.350 --> 04:17:37.500
It's construction is not super refined.

6341
04:17:37.500 --> 04:17:39.360
It looks semi-fragile,

6342
04:17:39.360 --> 04:17:42.777
but it's functional at the moment.

6343
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:45.190
You gather from, yeah,

6344
04:17:45.190 --> 04:17:48.390
because you get the properties from it.

6345
04:17:48.390 --> 04:17:50.980
This is what's called an abyssal anchor.

6346
04:17:50.980 --> 04:17:52.670
A crudely constructed abyssal anchor.

6347
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:54.690
It was used during the Calamity

6348
04:17:54.690 --> 04:17:57.750
by demon generals and such to punch holes

6349
04:17:57.750 --> 04:18:00.510
between the Abyss and the Prime Material Plane

6350
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:03.147
to use for invading various places

6351
04:18:03.147 --> 04:18:07.411
across the world of Exandria.

6352
04:18:07.411 --> 04:18:11.012
Essentially, it would be placed and would slowly

6353
04:18:11.012 --> 04:18:15.615
begin to tear the barriers between.

6354
04:18:15.615 --> 04:18:19.190
You gather that this was probably the slow growing

6355
04:18:19.190 --> 04:18:23.270
source of the various tears that have been happening

6356
04:18:23.270 --> 04:18:24.210
in the city.

6357
04:18:24.210 --> 04:18:25.685
LIAM: So it's not specific to one place.

6358
04:18:25.685 --> 04:18:27.283
It is, here, but also?

6359
04:18:27.283 --> 04:18:30.707
MATT: It's a wide area.

6360
04:18:30.707 --> 04:18:31.632
LIAM: A sphere of influence.

6361
04:18:31.632 --> 04:18:32.465
MATT: Correct.

6362
04:18:32.465 --> 04:18:34.056
TALIESIN: I'm going to maybe get 60 feet

6363
04:18:34.056 --> 04:18:34.890
away from this thing, if everyone wants

6364
04:18:34.890 --> 04:18:36.800
to stand back, and maybe hit it with some--

6365
04:18:36.800 --> 04:18:39.140
LAURA: We shouldn't destroy it, we should take it to them

6366
04:18:39.140 --> 04:18:40.830
and show it.

6367
04:18:40.830 --> 04:18:42.563
TALIESIN: I'm happy for it to be proof,

6368
04:18:42.563 --> 04:18:44.960
but it should be off.

6369
04:18:44.960 --> 04:18:47.093
We should turn it off.

6370
04:18:47.093 --> 04:18:48.770
LAURA: Do you have the ability to do that?

6371
04:18:48.770 --> 04:18:50.110
TALIESIN: I don't know. I can, at the very least--

6372
04:18:50.110 --> 04:18:50.943
MATT: Make an arcana check.

6373
04:18:50.943 --> 04:18:52.234
TALIESIN: Make an arcana check?

6374
04:18:52.234 --> 04:18:54.360
MARISHA: I just wouldn't shatter it into a thousand pieces

6375
04:18:54.360 --> 04:18:55.910
because then it's not proof anymore.

6376
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:58.360
TRAVIS: Just in case it's--
TALIESIN: 14.

6377
04:18:58.360 --> 04:19:00.215
MATT: You're not entirely certain how to

6378
04:19:00.215 --> 04:19:01.960
deactivate the enchantment.

6379
04:19:01.960 --> 04:19:03.980
LIAM: Maybe we are probably all right to put it

6380
04:19:03.980 --> 04:19:07.900
into the bag of holding, which is not even on this plane.

6381
04:19:07.900 --> 04:19:10.659
For a night.

6382
04:19:10.659 --> 04:19:14.575
SAM: Are you sure? It causes dimensional rifts.

6383
04:19:14.575 --> 04:19:15.908
Are you going to put it in a--?

6384
04:19:15.908 --> 04:19:18.260
TRAVIS: It would just open up into nothing.

6385
04:19:18.260 --> 04:19:20.040
MATT: Make an arcana check.

6386
04:19:20.040 --> 04:19:21.665
LAURA: If you put a dimensional rift

6387
04:19:21.665 --> 04:19:25.434
into a dimensional rift, the world ends, basically.

6388
04:19:25.434 --> 04:19:29.511
LIAM: 13 on it.
MATT: 13.

6389
04:19:29.511 --> 04:19:30.386
LIAM: Don't know?

6390
04:19:30.386 --> 04:19:31.344
MATT: Whatever you guys want to do.

6391
04:19:31.344 --> 04:19:32.177
MARISHA: Are a bunch of demons--

6392
04:19:32.177 --> 04:19:33.150
SAM: I don't want to put it in that.

6393
04:19:33.150 --> 04:19:36.128
We can put it in the lead box, but I don't want to put it--

6394
04:19:36.128 --> 04:19:37.581
TALIESIN and LAURA: I'm afraid to touch it.

6395
04:19:37.581 --> 04:19:41.900
LAURA: Maybe it would be best if we just go and tell

6396
04:19:41.900 --> 04:19:42.733
the lady about it.

6397
04:19:42.733 --> 04:19:44.891
MATT: I'll say, because of your training,

6398
04:19:44.891 --> 04:19:46.549
just because you are trained in it

6399
04:19:46.549 --> 04:19:49.920
and it's not a huge leap of logic,

6400
04:19:49.920 --> 04:19:51.640
putting a device like this while it's on

6401
04:19:51.640 --> 04:19:54.200
in the bag of holding would probably over time,

6402
04:19:54.200 --> 04:19:55.600
you don't know how soon, but it would begin to

6403
04:19:55.600 --> 04:19:59.580
open tears to the Abyss within the pocket plane.

6404
04:19:59.580 --> 04:20:01.985
Which means, creatures could find their way

6405
04:20:01.985 --> 04:20:04.994
into your bag of holding and take the contents out.

6406
04:20:04.994 --> 04:20:06.294
MARISHA: Take items out?

6407
04:20:06.294 --> 04:20:09.290
MATT: Yeah. If they can reach into your bag of holding,

6408
04:20:09.290 --> 04:20:11.102
and then take what's in there out,

6409
04:20:11.102 --> 04:20:12.165
yeah, that can totally happen.

6410
04:20:12.165 --> 04:20:13.360
TALIESIN: Does anybody have Dispel Magic left? I don't know.

6411
04:20:13.360 --> 04:20:14.193
LAURA: I'm out of spells.

6412
04:20:14.193 --> 04:20:16.730
Unless we rest, a long rest, I have nothing.

6413
04:20:16.730 --> 04:20:18.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to long rest, we might as well

6414
04:20:18.380 --> 04:20:22.850
just drop this off with Lady Olisa or whatever it is.

6415
04:20:22.850 --> 04:20:24.566
TALIESIN: What if we wake up

6416
04:20:24.566 --> 04:20:25.750
and there's a bunch of new stuff?

6417
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:29.750
SAM: Why don't we put it in the bubble with us?

6418
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:31.350
Nothing can get in or out of the bubble.

6419
04:20:31.350 --> 04:20:33.434
TALIESIN: I don't know, I mean--

6420
04:20:33.434 --> 04:20:36.530
LIAM: If we just rest here for a while, I can Dispel Magic.

6421
04:20:36.530 --> 04:20:38.690
SAM: Okay, let's do that.

6422
04:20:38.690 --> 04:20:41.007
MATT: Okay. What are you doing with the device

6423
04:20:41.007 --> 04:20:42.498
and the gloves?

6424
04:20:42.498 --> 04:20:43.950
LAURA: The gloves.

6425
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:45.200
TRAVIS: You mean the?
MATT: Yeah.

6426
04:20:45.200 --> 04:20:46.570
TRAVIS: That's in the bag of holding.

6427
04:20:46.570 --> 04:20:47.870
MATT: Oh, it's in the bag of holding, okay.

6428
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:49.100
MARISHA: We're going to sit here for a little bit,

6429
04:20:49.100 --> 04:20:50.890
do you mind if I like put them on

6430
04:20:50.890 --> 04:20:53.420
and see what happens? Thanks.

6431
04:20:53.420 --> 04:20:55.360
MATT: You're going to take a short rest to?

6432
04:20:55.360 --> 04:20:57.190
LIAM: Short rest. Arcane recovery.

6433
04:20:57.190 --> 04:21:02.182
MARISHA: I'm going to just meditate in the giant gloves

6434
04:21:02.182 --> 04:21:04.520
and see what happens.

6435
04:21:04.520 --> 04:21:07.164
MARISHA: Oh, you're doing your badass short rest.

6436
04:21:07.164 --> 04:21:09.239
LIAM: She's trying to attune. Yeah, she attuned.

6437
04:21:09.239 --> 04:21:10.214
MATT: You attuned them.

6438
04:21:10.214 --> 04:21:11.714
TALIESIN: Are they cursed?

6439
04:21:14.792 --> 04:21:16.025
MARISHA: No.

6440
04:21:17.600 --> 04:21:19.692
Don't think so.

6441
04:21:25.963 --> 04:21:28.721
LAURA: What is it, Beau? What did they do?

6442
04:21:28.721 --> 04:21:30.420
LIAM: She's going to read it.
LAURA: Don't be a Caleb.

6443
04:21:30.420 --> 04:21:31.764
LIAM: Leave her alone, let her read it.

6444
04:21:31.764 --> 04:21:34.076
SAM: If we're taking a short rest, can you, during that--

6445
04:21:34.076 --> 04:21:35.440
No, I guess during that time, you can't do anything.

6446
04:21:35.440 --> 04:21:38.210
TALIESIN: He's doing like the super weird--

6447
04:21:38.210 --> 04:21:40.286
MATT: You can do simple things, you know.

6448
04:21:40.286 --> 04:21:42.855
SAM: Not cast Identify ritually, though.

6449
04:21:42.855 --> 04:21:45.792
MATT: That's not very restful, yeah.

6450
04:21:48.770 --> 04:21:51.920
MARISHA: These gloves are dope.

6451
04:21:51.920 --> 04:21:55.329
I can now punch ghosts.

6452
04:21:55.329 --> 04:21:57.390
SAM: Someone who has those gloves can now?

6453
04:21:57.390 --> 04:21:59.538
MARISHA: Punch ghosts.

6454
04:21:59.538 --> 04:22:03.170
Also, I can punch people from a distance

6455
04:22:03.170 --> 04:22:06.900
of 20 feet away with lightning damage.

6456
04:22:06.900 --> 04:22:09.210
I can punch people with lightning.

6457
04:22:09.210 --> 04:22:10.730
SAM: You can ghost punch people?

6458
04:22:10.730 --> 04:22:14.580
MARISHA: I can ghost punch ghosts with lightning.

6459
04:22:14.580 --> 04:22:16.880
There are layers.

6460
04:22:16.880 --> 04:22:20.720
I'm so stoked.

6461
04:22:20.720 --> 04:22:22.078
SAM: Ranged punching.

6462
04:22:22.078 --> 04:22:24.953
MARISHA: Ranged punching. It gives me a plus one to my

6463
04:22:24.953 --> 04:22:28.160
unarmored attack and damage rolls.

6464
04:22:28.160 --> 04:22:30.200
MATT: Using arcane recovery to regain?

6465
04:22:30.200 --> 04:22:31.640
LIAM: To get back a three and a one.

6466
04:22:31.640 --> 04:22:35.962
I can use Dispel, oh no, shit.

6467
04:22:35.962 --> 04:22:40.620
It's not, I don't have it prepared. I have to go to bed.

6468
04:22:40.620 --> 04:22:43.450
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

6469
04:22:43.450 --> 04:22:47.320
Why don't we, at the very least, I can.

6470
04:22:49.775 --> 04:22:53.150
I don't know, I've got Stoneshape, still,

6471
04:22:53.150 --> 04:22:56.290
so if we want to seal the room and sleep

6472
04:22:56.290 --> 04:22:58.880
on the other side of the room, maybe for now.

6473
04:22:58.880 --> 04:23:00.420
SAM: We've got the dome.
LIAM: We can do the dome

6474
04:23:00.420 --> 04:23:03.290
and nothing can harm us in the dome.

6475
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:04.665
TALIESIN: Fair, all right.

6476
04:23:04.665 --> 04:23:05.973
SAM: Can we put the thing in a lead box?

6477
04:23:05.973 --> 04:23:07.689
Don't we have a lead box?

6478
04:23:07.689 --> 04:23:08.814
TALIESIN: I think.

6479
04:23:08.814 --> 04:23:10.213
LAURA: Yeah.

6480
04:23:10.213 --> 04:23:11.780
SAM: Put the thing in the lead box.

6481
04:23:11.780 --> 04:23:13.521
Is it small enough to fit?

6482
04:23:13.521 --> 04:23:15.846
MATT: It'll fit in the box you had made, yeah.

6483
04:23:15.846 --> 04:23:17.004
LAURA: All right. I'm going to not touch it,

6484
04:23:17.004 --> 04:23:21.834
but I'm going to shove the box around it, and close it.

6485
04:23:21.834 --> 04:23:23.470
MATT: All right, you shuffle it in there.

6486
04:23:23.470 --> 04:23:24.940
A few moments it gets bumped.

6487
04:23:24.940 --> 04:23:28.500
The like warm glow of orange flares a bit

6488
04:23:28.500 --> 04:23:30.690
as it gets bumped, but it seems fine.

6489
04:23:30.690 --> 04:23:33.645
LAURA: Okay, it's in the box.

6490
04:23:33.645 --> 04:23:36.600
TRAVIS: Box goes in the bag.
LAURA: Okay.

6491
04:23:36.600 --> 04:23:38.720
TALIESIN: Let's sleep.
SAM: No, the box does not

6492
04:23:38.720 --> 04:23:40.871
go in the bag.

6493
04:23:40.871 --> 04:23:44.480
MATT: You guys, through the use of your hut,

6494
04:23:44.480 --> 04:23:47.120
prepare yourselves for a long rest here amongst

6495
04:23:47.120 --> 04:23:49.720
the previous tears to the Abyssal plane.

6496
04:23:49.720 --> 04:23:52.470
Deep beneath the well of Asarius.

6497
04:23:52.470 --> 04:23:57.010
You bed down and take a much earned night of rest.

6498
04:23:57.010 --> 04:23:58.690
And that's where we'll go ahead and end tonight's adventure.

6499
04:23:58.690 --> 04:24:00.350

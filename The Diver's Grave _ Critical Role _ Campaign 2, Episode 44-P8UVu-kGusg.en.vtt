MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:05.661
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:09.957
(whooping and cheering)

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:15.335
MATT: Anyway! Before we hop into tonight's
episode, we have some quick announcements to get

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.494
through so bear with us. First and foremost, we
have our fantastic friends of old returning to

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:24.787
cosponsor tonight's episode: our friends at
Backblaze.

00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:29.886
SAM: That's right, Backblaze-- Is the camera on
me? The camera is on me! Backblaze, guys, you know

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:34.733
them. Backblaze backs up all of your data, movies,
music, video, cosplay designs, character sheets,

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.394
fanart, more for just five dollars a month--

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:38.675
MARISHA: Five dollars?

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:44.749
SAM: I use the service. No gimmicks. No add-ons.
No gotchas. Works on Mac and PC. They also have

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:53.265
the option to restore by mail. Backblaze will send
you a physical hard drive! Yes and it is hardcore.

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:58.757
I don't know. They backed up over 35 billion
files. They're legit. Go to

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:04.372
backblaze.com/criticalrole to check it out. Start
your free trial now and let them know you're

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:10.200
coming from our show. This will also, this is the
important part, be Backblaze's last sponsorship

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.725
for a while. It's a little bittersweet so please,
if you're are going to go show them some love, now

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:23.950
is the time to do it. Go to
backblaze.com/criticalrole. Yev, our fantastic

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.492
friend from Backblaze, wanted to say thanks to the
entire cast and crew for being so awesome and

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:36.438
welcoming and a very special thanks to me, Sam,
for all the effort I put into the ad reads. Aww.

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:43.954
So to thank him, I wrote two songs. I'll only sing
one but I'm going to give it to the cast-- the

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:48.823
cast can decide which one. Do you want to hear
Spice Girls or Golden Girls?

00:01:48.823 --> 00:01:50.744
LAURA and TALIESIN: Golden Girls.

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:53.955
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and LIAM: Spice Girls.

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:55.480
TRAVIS: Matt's going to decide it.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.619
TALIESIN: Contentious.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.033
MATT: Oh, this is really bad.

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.021
SAM: You're going to roll for it?

00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:06.069
MATT: Yeah, I'm going to roll for it. All right,
if it's one to ten: Golden Girls. 11 to 20: Spice

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.891
Girls. That's going to be Golden Girls.

00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:14.908
SAM: Okay. (singing to the tune of "Thank You for
Being a Friend") Thank you for being our Yev.

00:02:14.908 --> 00:02:24.616
Backed up all my shit again and again. Your app is
true. You're a pal and you pay for our show. And

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:32.889
if I nuked my laptop, viruses fill the whole thing
up with porn. I would see you and you'd send my

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:40.476
hard drive back to me and the card attached would
say, "Thank you being our Yev."

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:49.885
LAURA: We love you, Yev.

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:51.452
TRAVIS: Much love Backblaze.

00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:55.723
MATT: Much love, Yev and all our friends at
Backblaze and our fantastic returning sponsor for

00:02:55.723 --> 00:03:01.329
this evening as well, our friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond.
In case you missed it, they've launched their new

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.695
show, "Heroes of the Vale". We talked about it
last week a bit. DMed by the fantastic Mike

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:10.952
Mearls, designer of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Fifth
Edition at Wizard of the Coast, amongst some of

00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:14.856
the great members of the team. He is DMing his own
world, Nentir Vale. I'm familiar with it from

00:03:14.856 --> 00:03:19.630
fourth edition. It's actually a really cool world.
An amazing cast-- friend of the show TJ Storm,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.699
Todd Kenreck, friend of ours at D&amp;amp;D Beyond, Shelly
Mazzanoble, a bunch of other amazing people on the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.856
show. Check it out. I think their second episode
just went up recently, which is awesome. It's

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:36.309
every Wednesday at 2pm Pacific time on
twitch.tv/dndbeyond and you can follow it

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:43.803
@DnDBeyond on Twitter as well. This is the last
month to use coupon code SamIsYourHero.

00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:45.309
SAM: SamIsOurHero.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:49.903
MATT: Or our hero. Sorry. SamIsOurHero. My
apologies. The lettering there was-- for 25

00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:55.669
percent off all digital books purchases in D&amp;amp;D
Beyond there. So make sure if you're going to do

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:01.906
it, take charge and utilize this fantastic
opportunity. You only got a few more weeks so do

00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:05.217
it. (Pumat Sol voice) Do it!

00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:07.942
TRAVIS: (Pumat Sol voice) Take advantage. I made
a--

00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:11.600
MARISHA: Oh yeah, you did good. Yeah, that was
good.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.562
MATT: That was good.

00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:13.249
TRAVIS: I think I let down Matt.

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:14.213
MARISHA: You get a gold star for the day.

00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:15.499
LIAM: I'm working hard, buddy.

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:22.750
MATT: Exactly. (Pumat Sol voice) "It's also Pumat
week here. While we're in a similar vein," (normal

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.720
voice) so we're celebrating everything Pumat here
at Critical Role. We have the new t-shirt in the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:37.449
store, which you can look at here. It's available.
You can head to critrole.com. shop.critrole.com, I

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.089
believe, to go ahead and get your t-shirt. Also,
we have the new Pumat voice pack that is available

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:48.599
through our friends at-- was it-- Killer Voices!
Thank you. My brain--

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:49.906
MARISHA: Overwolf.

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:54.413
MATT: Overwolf and Killer Voices. You can download
the voice pack for a number of popular games.

00:04:54.413 --> 00:05:01.451
League of Legends, PUBG, Fortnite, DOTA 2 and as
opposed to the regular announcer, you get to have

00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:08.150
"me tell you when you kill somebody, 'Poor
fella.'" Or when you lose a match being like, "Oh,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.457
maybe you should have rolled a paladin." So yeah,
we did a whole shit ton of variations. This

00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:20.436
Saturday is a video stream of me and Taliesin here
playing Fortnite for the first time for both of us!

00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:24.519
TALIESIN and MATT: It's a thing.

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:26.248
TALIESIN: It's entertaining.

00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:31.248
MATT: If you have played a lot of Fortnite, watch
and marvel at how terrible we are at the game.

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:32.760
TALIESIN: This will be you one day.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.117
LIAM: You didn't dominate?

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:35.847
TALIESIN: I don't even--

00:05:35.847 --> 00:05:38.153
MATT: It depends on what your goal is in playing
the game--

00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:39.277
TALIESIN: We succeeded.

00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:47.493
MATT: If your goal was to play it and build stuff,
we did that a few times.

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:48.687
LAURA: Good job, guys.

00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:52.424
TALIESIN: We did. It was nice. We played it more
like Minecraft really, like Minecraft with

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:58.585
snipers. Oh, this is such a nice garden we're--
and it's over. I don't even know what happened.

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:01.459
MATT: We had some sweet moments. We built some
memories together.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:02.725
TALIESIN: We found a bunker.

00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:04.207
MATT: We found a bunker and we outfitted it--

00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:05.527
TALIESIN: I really enjoyed that bunker.

00:06:05.527 --> 00:06:06.147
MATT: It was beautiful.

00:06:06.147 --> 00:06:07.162
TALIESIN: There was balloons.

00:06:07.162 --> 00:06:11.522
MATT: That would be this Saturday on
twitch.tv/criticalrole. You can find all that info

00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:17.835
at critrole.com. All right, we also have your FPS
stream coming up soon Travis on top of all that--

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:21.746
TRAVIS: That's right. Oh god, I know! At least I'm
not the only one that's going to get butchered.

00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:25.032
Yeah, next Tuesday, December 11th at 4pm--

00:06:25.032 --> 00:06:27.100
MARISHA: We're the worst Twitch streamers.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.483
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. Totally. We're the anti-Twitch
streamers. There's really good people like Ninja

00:06:33.483 --> 00:06:40.041
and then there's us. Every yin has a yang, right?
So Foster and I, next Tuesday the 11th, we're

00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:44.419
going to play some Black Ops as part of our recent
fundraising campaign for Operation Supply Drop! It

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.359
will be live at twitch.tv/criticalrole.

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:50.173
LIAM: I bet you guys clock in at like just below
average--

00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:54.738
TRAVIS: We probably won't suck too much. We'll
have moments of brilliance followed by lots of swearing.

00:06:54.906 --> 00:06:56.185
LAURA: When was the last time you played?

00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:56.969
TRAVIS: It's been months.

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:57.596
LAURA: Yeah.

00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:59.007
TRAVIS: Many months because of baby.

00:06:59.007 --> 00:06:59.906
LAURA: Because of baby.

00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:02.952
TRAVIS: And in the in between moments that I do
have: Red Dead. Sorry Black Ops, but I got to get

00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:05.115
back in there and practice.

00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:07.432
(laughter)

00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:08.262
MATT: That was a look.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:09.870
LIAM: That took a dark turn.

00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:15.051
MATT: Yeah, they worked it out. Thank you Travis.
Excited for that. All right, and before we kick

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:24.573
into tonight's episode, we have something cool to
show you guys. Very happy to unveil this so I

00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:31.434
figure, let's go ahead and jump in. Roll the
tape.

00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:35.480
[water bubbling]

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.733
[thunder]

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:40.766
[explosion]

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:45.638
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:07:45.638 --> 00:07:53.268
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:07:53.268 --> 00:08:02.215
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:09.917
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:14.445
Villains beware 'cause you're 'bout to be dead.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.688
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:08:23.688 --> 00:08:31.274
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:08:31.274 --> 00:08:35.540
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:43.635
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:48.935
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Dig in deep in your soul as the legend

00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:58.838
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:06.477
[fire burning]

00:09:06.477 --> 00:09:12.745
(laughter and cheering)

00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:20.574
MATT: That was pretty awesome. That's our new
intro guys. Travis and Sam kept this a secret from

00:09:20.574 --> 00:09:22.098
all of us for a long time.

00:09:22.098 --> 00:09:28.236
TRAVIS: Yeah we did. For over five months, Sam and
I worked with some extremely talented animators in

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:36.384
the Philippines. We have to give massive props and
love to Kamille and Kevin Areopagita. They are

00:09:36.384 --> 00:09:44.765
absolutely brilliant. You can check out their
twitter page at @karekareo. Their patreon is

00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:51.081
there. Go. Give them both love. Support their
patreon. They are far too talented to not be doing

00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:56.887
more. We were so lucky to work with them on this.
They were absolutely amazing. Every little bit of

00:09:56.887 --> 00:10:01.672
creative input we gave them, they just smashed it.
We couldn't be happier.

00:10:01.672 --> 00:10:06.747
SAM: Yes and we have other people to thank for
putting this whole thing together. Specifically,

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:13.297
our lovely Laura Bailey and Ashley Johnson for
singing that theme song.

00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:15.635
LIAM: So good!

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:20.927
SAM: We put together a new song for you guys and
the ladies took the leads and they killed it.

00:10:20.927 --> 00:10:27.111
Destroyed it. You might also hear some light
backing vocals from a young Sam Riegel and a young

00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:34.991
Travis Willingham buried deep in there and we
should also give a shout out to Jason Charles

00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:41.135
Miller who co-wrote the song and also did a lot of
the instrumentation and made it really cool and

00:10:41.135 --> 00:10:48.434
rock and roll and stuff. You'll see-- you won't
see. You'll hear, there's a little violin part by

00:10:48.434 --> 00:10:52.689
Colm McGuinness who's a friend of the show. He
recorded a violin part.

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:53.976
TRAVIS: Did the little Wildemount theme song.

00:10:53.976 --> 00:11:00.931
SAM: Yeah. My brother-in-law Peter Habib of Mr.
Fantastic did the final mix for the song. It was

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:06.579
really fun to do and now it's out there and you
guys saw it and we hope you like it.

00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:13.442
TRAVIS: So good and you'll be able to see all of
them now as much as you want but I figure we'll

00:11:13.442 --> 00:11:15.440
let Matt make it part of the new official thing--

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.724
SAM: Oh, and also I think the song-- Do we
announce about the song?

00:11:17.724 --> 00:11:19.185
TRAVIS: It should be available--

00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:23.724
SAM: The song will be on iTunes and stuff soon?
Now-ish?

00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:28.499
TRAVIS: We'll see. As soon as tonight. Maybe
tomorrow or two weeks. It just depends on how that

00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:29.561
service works.

00:11:29.561 --> 00:11:30.387
MARISHA: I think now.

00:11:30.387 --> 00:11:32.768
SAM: It's called "Your Turn to Roll" so look it
up.

00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:35.011
TRAVIS: "Your Turn to Roll." A Critical Role
thing.

00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:37.598
MARISHA: The TDs are prepared to play it again if
we so choose.

00:11:37.598 --> 00:11:40.482
LIAM: No, they don't want to see it. We should
just get to the game, right?

00:11:40.482 --> 00:11:41.899
TRAVIS: You shut your damn mouth!

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:43.393
LIAM: Roll it again!

00:11:43.393 --> 00:11:46.999
TRAVIS: Let's let Matt make it official.

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:52.678
MATT: Without further ado, let's go ahead and jump
in to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:11:55.012 --> 00:11:59.219
[water bubbling]

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:02.519
[thunder]

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:04.400
[explosion]

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:10.574
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:12:10.574 --> 00:12:16.845
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:12:16.845 --> 00:12:25.315
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:12:25.315 --> 00:12:33.649
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:38.261
Villains beware 'cause you're 'bout to be dead.

00:12:41.772 --> 00:12:47.243
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:12:47.243 --> 00:12:54.761
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:59.540
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:07.327
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:13:07.327 --> 00:13:12.502
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Dig in deep in your soul as the legend

00:13:12.502 --> 00:13:22.756
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:13:22.756 --> 00:13:31.127
[fire burning]

00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:35.790
MATT: And welcome back. Good job, Liam.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.891
LIAM: It's the only thing I'm here for.

00:13:39.891 --> 00:13:49.019
MATT: So last we left off, the Mighty Nein, after
being pulled through a series of pirate adjacent

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:55.498
and straight up pirate adventures across the
Swavain Islands here in the Lucidian ocean, on the

00:13:55.498 --> 00:14:01.068
ship, the Squalleater, under the Captain
Avantica's rule, you made your way to Darktow

00:14:01.068 --> 00:14:08.630
where you attempted to find a way to discredit
her. Find a way to not be dragged into her

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:15.620
business in the future. It got a little messy but
you managed to avoid it coming to too terrible a

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:22.033
head until you are brought into her ship last week
where a battle unfolded, in which most of you

00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:27.939
managed to skitter away with the contents of this
journal that you had taken from her as well as the

00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:34.437
translation for the cipher that was used to write
it. Managed to make your way to the Plank King in

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:42.603
time and have him bring his resources to the docks
before any more of you could be further destroyed.

00:14:42.603 --> 00:14:50.434
Summoning a demon helped as part of the
distraction, as well as patiently waiting. Some

00:14:50.434 --> 00:14:58.440
quick thought process moments. You guys did pretty
damn well. You managed to just break enough laws

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:06.874
to be put not in favor of the Plank King but
managed to have done a large favor enough to be

00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:12.890
let leave and never return. Taking the hobbled
ship that you guys had busted with you, you made

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:19.822
your way out into the open ocean, heading
northeast from Darktow and the Dragshallow Reef,

00:15:19.822 --> 00:15:28.541
in search of the possible shipwreck that started
Fjord's destiny in the direction of Uk'otoa. After

00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:39.220
days of travel and a few location spells cast, you
managed to find a blip at the base of the sea.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:47.561
Using your newfound ability to instill the ability
to breathe water within the party around you, you

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:54.442
sunk to the bottom, holding onto cannonballs, and
began to walk the bottom floor in search of the

00:15:54.442 --> 00:16:03.960
shipwreck, eventually coming upon a valley caldera
that slowly sinks down. You noticed, aside from

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:11.951
the whale that just skimmed your presence, the bow
of a derelict, wrecked ship sitting there,

00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:19.069
surrounded by seaweed in the barely-visible,
creeping daylight making it this deep in the

00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:29.716
waters. So with your lights aglow and the wreck
before you, Mighty Nein, what do you want to do?

00:16:31.188 --> 00:16:34.234
TRAVIS: I saw it. That's all I needed. We can head
back up now.

00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:36.221
SAM: Good.

00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:39.747
TRAVIS: No! We're doing this thing, Nott. We're
pushing through.

00:16:39.747 --> 00:16:40.684
SAM: We're doing what? No.

00:16:40.684 --> 00:16:41.685
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:41.685 --> 00:16:45.898
LAURA: So we're searching for the orb?

00:16:45.898 --> 00:16:50.912
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, that'd be great, if we could
find that.

00:16:50.912 --> 00:16:53.738
MARISHA: Do you have any idea of where it might
be?

00:16:53.738 --> 00:16:54.954
TRAVIS: No.

00:16:54.954 --> 00:16:55.919
MARISHA: All right.

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:57.633
TRAVIS: No.

00:16:57.633 --> 00:17:01.845
LAURA: Is there anything else we should look for,
Fjord?

00:17:01.845 --> 00:17:09.438
TRAVIS: Let's see what's down there in general.
Hope it goes without saying, if you find any

00:17:09.438 --> 00:17:13.663
remains, let's be respectful.

00:17:13.663 --> 00:17:15.882
TALIESIN: Of course.

00:17:15.882 --> 00:17:22.458
LAURA: Do you have a pair of jammies or something
that you lost in the boat that you want us to look

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:28.107
for? Your bedroom or something in there? No?

00:17:28.107 --> 00:17:29.475
TRAVIS: No.

00:17:29.475 --> 00:17:31.240
LAURA: Okay.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.718
TRAVIS: Do we see any other sea life?

00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:39.971
MATT: We'll get to that because there was a note
left here on my table that I almost forgot because

00:17:39.971 --> 00:17:47.437
the game has started. This was written and left
behind by Logic as he passed through earlier. It

00:17:47.437 --> 00:17:50.031
says, "Flip over and read as soon as the game
starts."

00:17:50.031 --> 00:17:51.496
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:59.149
MATT: "You, Sir Matt, are the sexiest being in all
of Neverland. Sincerely, your boo, Logic."

00:17:59.149 --> 00:18:03.094
(laughter)

00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:04.371
MATT: That's very sweet.

00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:05.590
MARISHA: It's canon.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.364
MATT: Thank you, buddy.

00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:10.211
TRAVIS: Thank god it's not, "Here's an Astral
Dreadnought."

00:18:10.211 --> 00:18:13.922
MATT: Yeah, I know. Loading the gun against you
guys for the game tonight. It'd be pretty funny.

00:18:13.922 --> 00:18:16.116
LIAM: Does that mean that Logic was the whale that
just passed us by?

00:18:16.116 --> 00:18:17.011
MATT: There you go.

00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:19.506
MARISHA: Oh my god!

00:18:19.506 --> 00:18:23.190
LAURA: We still have Pass Without a Trace up. I
just cast it because of that whale.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.097
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

00:18:24.097 --> 00:18:24.972
MARISHA: Hey, Caduceus.

00:18:24.972 --> 00:18:25.608
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:18:25.608 --> 00:18:30.988
MARISHA: You feeling any creepy, spooky, dead
people, or crawlies?

00:18:30.988 --> 00:18:32.062
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:18:32.062 --> 00:18:33.546
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

00:18:33.546 --> 00:18:36.925
TALIESIN: That's actually a good idea. I'm also
going to--

00:18:36.925 --> 00:18:41.567
MATT: With disadvantage because there's no light
here, and it's a very short range, I'd say.

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:44.082
Because you guys extinguished all your lights when
the--

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.267
TRAVIS: That's a natural one.

00:18:45.267 --> 00:18:46.876
LAURA: Ooh, starting out right. Woo!

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.209
TALIESIN: Perception checks?

00:18:48.209 --> 00:18:49.226
MATT: If you want to.

00:18:49.226 --> 00:18:52.341
TALIESIN: Also, I'm going to cast Eyes of the
Grave. I'm going to do this a couple times.

00:18:52.341 --> 00:18:53.318
SAM: Eyes of the Grave.

00:18:53.318 --> 00:19:00.341
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave! That's perception of
22.

00:19:00.341 --> 00:19:02.260
MATT: With disadvantage?

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.621
TALIESIN: Oh, with disadvantage.

00:19:03.621 --> 00:19:09.438
MATT: Because you do not have darkvision, and it's
very dark under here, and the distance is very

00:19:09.438 --> 00:19:11.298
short. You don't have any lights up.

00:19:11.298 --> 00:19:12.206
LAURA: We did have lights up.

00:19:12.206 --> 00:19:15.876
MATT: You extinguished them when the whale came
by. You can put the lights back on if you want.

00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:17.438
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, I thought we had put them back
up.

00:19:17.438 --> 00:19:19.132
TRAVIS: I have darkvision.

00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.336
MATT: That's true, you do have darkvision.

00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:21.412
TRAVIS: The first one was a five, so six.

00:19:21.412 --> 00:19:22.911
MATT: Okay, there you go. Six.

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:23.890
TALIESIN: 12.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.081
MATT: 12. Okay.

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.560
TALIESIN: With Eyes of the Grave.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.293
MATT: Got you. Eyes of the Grave, you don't sense
anything gathering your attention as you attempt

00:19:31.293 --> 00:19:38.303
to reach out your essence to feel for any undead
presence. Nothing. But the very cold waters here

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:46.756
beneath still keep you a bit chilled. It is very
cold down here. Looking around best you can with

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:55.259
the lack of light, aside from the swaying bits of
seaweed that are all fluttering up and slowly

00:19:55.259 --> 00:20:00.751
swaying, reaching up hundreds and hundreds of feet
before the darkness takes them, you see the bow of

00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:05.267
that wrecked ship. Not much else catches your
attention.

00:20:05.267 --> 00:20:07.804
MARISHA: Fjord, what was the name of the ship
again?

00:20:09.183 --> 00:20:11.024
TRAVIS: (raspberry)

00:20:11.024 --> 00:20:12.602
SAM: You know, the ship that started your whole
backstory?

00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:13.759
MATT: It's the Tide's Breadth.

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:14.925
TRAVIS: The Tide's Breadth.

00:20:14.925 --> 00:20:17.373
(laughter)

00:20:17.373 --> 00:20:19.561
SAM: Your origin story?

00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:22.164
TALIESIN: Yeah, the sheet of paper you turned in
nine months ago.

00:20:22.164 --> 00:20:28.665
TRAVIS: I don't think I named it in my backstory!
The Tide's Breadth, yes.

00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:34.979
LIAM: I am going to summon Frumpkin to my shoulder
and look through Frumpkin's eyes because Frumpkin,

00:20:34.979 --> 00:20:38.783
as an octopus, has darkvision. So I will see that
way.

00:20:38.783 --> 00:20:40.768
MATT: Perception check with Frumpkin.

00:20:42.987 --> 00:20:48.376
LIAM: Oh, not so good. That's his? Just a seven.

00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:52.182
MATT: Still a shipwreck. There is a shipwreck
ahead of you guys.

00:20:52.182 --> 00:20:56.639
LAURA: When we step, does it make a powder go up
because it's like (poof) on the ocean floor?

00:20:56.639 --> 00:21:02.444
MATT: As you do step across the surface of the sea
floor, there are bits of the silt and sediment

00:21:02.444 --> 00:21:06.277
that clouds around your foot with each footfall.

00:21:06.277 --> 00:21:12.639
LAURA: This is all fish poop! (spits) See that,
Nott?

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:15.757
SAM: No, no thanks. Ugh.

00:21:15.757 --> 00:21:17.516
LAURA: Should we go?

00:21:17.516 --> 00:21:20.253
TALIESIN: I'm perfectly happy to head towards
this.

00:21:20.253 --> 00:21:21.366
TRAVIS: Let's go for it.

00:21:21.366 --> 00:21:23.008
MARISHA: You said we had Pass Without a Trace?

00:21:23.008 --> 00:21:27.202
SAM: I'm going to try to drink underwater.

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:28.396
TRAVIS: Like a seal.

00:21:28.396 --> 00:21:29.676
MATT: Okay.

00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:34.433
SAM: Going to attempt to drink alcohol
underwater.

00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:42.196
MATT: Yes. So you take, and you tip it back. The
thing is, in order for the liquid to leave the

00:21:42.196 --> 00:21:49.466
vessel, you have to send air to occupy the space;
there's a transition there. But you're breathing

00:21:49.466 --> 00:21:53.097
water, so it will mix water with whatever's in
there.

00:21:53.097 --> 00:21:54.401
LAURA: It's salt water, too.

00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:56.090
SAM: Oh, shit.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.768
LAURA: You're going to get the poops if you do
it.

00:21:57.768 --> 00:21:58.899
MARISHA: Super dehydrating.

00:21:58.899 --> 00:22:08.327
SAM: I'll try to coax it out. (blowing)

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:14.983
MATT: I mean, you're not having to siphon it like
gasoline! As soon as you open it, it begins to

00:22:14.983 --> 00:22:21.995
diffuse into the nearby sea. It's very briny
alcohol.

00:22:21.995 --> 00:22:27.234
SAM: Gets the job done.

00:22:27.234 --> 00:22:31.146
MATT: This darkened cloud is filling around Nott's
face.

00:22:31.146 --> 00:22:37.467
LAURA: Is this where Dashilla is? Or is she at a
different place?

00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:41.456
TRAVIS: Per the song? I mean--

00:22:41.456 --> 00:22:46.718
MARISHA: It said that she was in this Diver's
Grave general location, so maybe she's not here.

00:22:46.718 --> 00:22:49.497
LAURA: Oh, so there could be something really
scary in here.

00:22:49.497 --> 00:22:52.519
TRAVIS: I mean, what are the chances? The ocean's
huge.

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:55.396
LAURA: The chances are really good, Fjord. They're
really good.

00:22:55.396 --> 00:22:58.221
MARISHA: Yeah, do you have our luck? You've seen
it.

00:22:58.221 --> 00:23:00.690
TRAVIS: Glass half empty, I get it. It's all
right.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.562
MARISHA: Apparently she has a hungry eye.

00:23:02.562 --> 00:23:04.956
LAURA: (laughter)

00:23:04.956 --> 00:23:08.307
TRAVIS: Got eyes right now. All right, we'll push
forward.

00:23:08.307 --> 00:23:13.943
MATT: You guys begin to approach, stepping
carefully towards the base of this. The ship,

00:23:13.943 --> 00:23:20.827
where it's sitting, it's resting at an odd angle,
the front of it, the bow slightly angled upward.

00:23:20.827 --> 00:23:31.092
You can see the side where this large explosion
tore through the hull. Already, for as long as

00:23:31.092 --> 00:23:37.907
it's been there, which has not been but a year
maybe, tops, you can see the rust and the

00:23:37.907 --> 00:23:45.498
barnacles beginning to gather and claim the
shipwreck to join. But that's best you can make

00:23:45.498 --> 00:23:49.173
out with the lack of light down here.

00:23:51.645 --> 00:23:55.844
TRAVIS: Should we stick together, or do we want to
fan out and go around?

00:23:55.844 --> 00:24:00.646
LIAM: I could send Frumpkin in ahead of us to have
a look around, if you think that's wise.

00:24:00.646 --> 00:24:02.700
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah, that'd be fine.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.971
MARISHA: That's funny.

00:24:03.971 --> 00:24:05.132
LIAM: Yes, it is.

00:24:05.132 --> 00:24:05.760
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:14.401
TRAVIS: As we get closer, can we see from outside
the ship the extent of the damage from the initial explosion?

00:24:14.401 --> 00:24:19.451
MATT: You'd probably have to go around a little
bit, but yeah. You walk around the opposite side

00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:24.848
of it. Looking in, you can see there's some
damage. You can see there are holes blown out on

00:24:24.848 --> 00:24:29.319
the side that you were facing. As you curve
around, you can see where there's a large, gaping

00:24:29.319 --> 00:24:32.394
hole in the side of the cargo hold.

00:24:32.394 --> 00:24:40.388
MARISHA: Fjord, I know we've heard the story
probably a dozen times, but can you refresh us on

00:24:40.388 --> 00:24:43.266
what happened the day this ship sank?

00:24:43.266 --> 00:24:48.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I chased Sabian down into the
hold of the ship, and he was messing with a

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:55.132
package. I saw a fuse burning. As I chased him
back up above deck, there was an explosion, and it

00:24:55.132 --> 00:25:04.043
threw me from the ship. It's nice to know that it
wasn't a small explosion. A real motherfucker of a

00:25:04.043 --> 00:25:06.146
thing, apparently.

00:25:06.146 --> 00:25:10.808
SAM: Were you being pursued by anyone?

00:25:10.808 --> 00:25:16.841
TRAVIS: No, we were in a storm. He wasn't supposed
to go below decks, either; that wasn't normally

00:25:16.841 --> 00:25:24.444
his thing, so it was strange. When he went down
there, I saw him. When I confronted him, he threw

00:25:24.444 --> 00:25:26.689
a dagger into my chest.

00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:28.049
MARISHA: What?

00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:36.172
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, he turned on me real fast. He
seemed to know that what he was doing wasn't up to

00:25:36.237 --> 00:25:43.712
snuff. When I chased him above, he was at the bow
of the ship, getting ready to exit or jump off.

00:25:43.712 --> 00:25:49.814
Obviously he knew what was coming next. Then the
explosion went, and the last thing I saw was the

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:53.324
ship as I was being thrown off.

00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:57.721
MARISHA: So you all were double-crossed, clearly.

00:25:57.721 --> 00:26:04.798
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't know why, though. I didn't
see anybody.

00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:11.525
MARISHA: Onward, I guess.

00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:14.104
LAURA: He made it off safely?

00:26:14.104 --> 00:26:16.701
TRAVIS: I don't know. I assume.

00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:24.434
MATT: You did hear tale of him passing through
Nicodranas not too long ago.

00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:26.471
MARISHA: Sabian is the same person as Vandren?

00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:33.144
TRAVIS: No, Sabian was someone I grew up with who
was also brought by Vandren to work on the ship.

00:26:33.144 --> 00:26:40.389
Yeah, I've known him for many, many years, and
he's always been a piece of shit of one variety or

00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:47.979
another. Only in the most recent years did I think
that maybe that stuff had faded between us, and

00:26:47.979 --> 00:26:53.623
we'd found a way to work together. But apparently
not.

00:26:54.854 --> 00:26:58.266
MATT: As you guys have gotten closer to around the
side of the ship where the most extensive damage

00:26:58.266 --> 00:27:05.207
was taken, you can see where the top of the deck
and the edges are blackened from a fire that broke

00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:11.543
out, probably during or shortly after the
explosion, but before it sank fully. The edges of

00:27:11.543 --> 00:27:15.611
the cargo hold that are blown open-- as soon as
you begin to peer in the inside, you can see the

00:27:15.611 --> 00:27:21.304
interior is blackened as well, amongst the other
patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it

00:27:21.304 --> 00:27:30.483
as a home, and bits of seaweed, and general sea
vegetation that has begun to find its way inside

00:27:30.483 --> 00:27:31.863
the empty ship.

00:27:31.863 --> 00:27:39.257
TRAVIS: Ooh. As an idea, sword in my hand, as we
start to push in through that hole of the

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:45.852
explosion, or peer in, can I lead with the sword
and see if the light and/or eye is reacting in any

00:27:45.852 --> 00:27:48.608
sort of way? Or is it just static?

00:27:48.608 --> 00:27:50.935
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:27:54.167 --> 00:27:57.230
TRAVIS: Not my best. Nine.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.247
MARISHA: Nein.

00:27:58.247 --> 00:28:02.009
MATT: Nein. As you begin to swim into the
darkened interior, holding the sword in front of

00:28:02.009 --> 00:28:10.647
you, it doesn't seem to react, adjust, or give you
any sense that it is able to guide you in any

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.843
particular direction.

00:28:13.843 --> 00:28:20.696
TRAVIS: In the sea, certain creatures like to make
homes of vessels. You want to send in your--?

00:28:20.696 --> 00:28:26.878
LIAM: Ja, that's no problem. I give a little tug
to the leather tied at my knee and cast Mage

00:28:26.878 --> 00:28:32.919
Armor. I send Frumpkin in, and reach for Nott, and
hold Nott by the shoulder. Look through Frumpkin's

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:35.694
eyes and send him in to look.

00:28:35.694 --> 00:28:44.286
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin's octopus form makes his way
into the cargo hold of the Tide's Breadth

00:28:44.286 --> 00:28:49.067
wreckage. Go ahead and roll a perception check for
Frumpkin and take a look around.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:56.074
LIAM: Terrible. Just terrible. Five.

00:28:56.074 --> 00:29:02.554
MATT: Unfortunately, there's so little light down
here, even for the darkvision. There's the basic

00:29:02.554 --> 00:29:10.390
outline of the interior hold. Frumpkin can notice
the outline of pieces of broken crates and other

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:16.996
elements that may have once been stored within the
ship, but very little detail is visible.

00:29:16.996 --> 00:29:20.970
LIAM: Fjord, do you think it is safe to send in
some light with him?

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.583
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:25.360
LIAM: Tap me on the shoulder if you hear me
because I cannot hear you.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.519
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:33.718
TALIESIN: Quick point of order, who's got the
node? We should probably decide now.

00:29:33.718 --> 00:29:35.294
LAURA: Oh, I have the node.

00:29:35.294 --> 00:29:37.278
TALIESIN: Who was the last to node? Are you
noded?

00:29:37.278 --> 00:29:40.414
LAURA: I can node, but somebody else could node.

00:29:40.414 --> 00:29:41.832
TRAVIS: Why don't you node?

00:29:41.832 --> 00:29:42.662
TALIESIN: You node.

00:29:42.662 --> 00:29:43.457
LIAM: (gutturally) Node.

00:29:43.457 --> 00:29:45.398
LAURA: Will water get in the bag if I look in--

00:29:45.398 --> 00:29:50.152
TALIESIN: I assume we would have done it. I was
just playing flashback, but I don't know.

00:29:50.152 --> 00:29:52.303
MATT: Well, if you haven't yet, then you'll be
doing it now.

00:29:52.303 --> 00:29:54.147
LAURA: Is it okay to do that?

00:29:54.147 --> 00:29:55.355
MATT: One way to find out.

00:29:55.355 --> 00:29:56.982
SAM: That sounds crazy.

00:29:56.982 --> 00:30:01.168
LIAM: My spell books are in there, so please-- I
can't hear anything.

00:30:01.168 --> 00:30:05.607
TALIESIN: That was more of a point of order.

00:30:05.607 --> 00:30:10.566
LIAM: I am bowling ball sending one globule of
light in after Frumpkin to go with him.

00:30:10.566 --> 00:30:16.928
MATT: Okay. It emanates and lights up the
immediate vicinity. The balls don't give off a lot

00:30:16.928 --> 00:30:21.782
of light; they're not torchlight, in comparison.
They work in conjunction to create a larger space

00:30:21.782 --> 00:30:30.802
of light, but it does help a little bit. With that
benefit, looking in the space, you can see there

00:30:30.802 --> 00:30:39.587
are no bodies. There are no signs of any
individuals who were on this ship, but you also

00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:44.957
know from your experience on the sea that those
who die at sea usually float to the surface.

00:30:44.957 --> 00:30:47.911
TRAVIS: And drift.

00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:54.984
MATT: Yes. You do see some metallic materials that
have grown rusted. You can see the shattered

00:30:54.984 --> 00:31:01.381
crates that I mentioned before. A lot of them are
burned and destroyed. As Frumpkin drifts past one

00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:07.688
of them, you look inside. There may have been some
metal bars or some sort of a construction-type

00:31:07.688 --> 00:31:13.971
iron material, but it's mostly melted and fused
together. In fact, as Frumpkin makes his way

00:31:13.971 --> 00:31:17.488
around, all the elements of metal that were
immediately in the vicinity-- it looks like there

00:31:17.488 --> 00:31:23.209
was a cannon. There were some other bits of-- all
you can make out is debris at this point, but

00:31:23.209 --> 00:31:28.573
other things that were metallic in nature that
have since bowed and fused from the heat of the

00:31:28.573 --> 00:31:32.041
explosion and the fire than ensued thereafter
before it sank.

00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:37.049
LIAM: It's mucky and dark in there. We would have
to take a closer look; I cannot make out much.

00:31:37.049 --> 00:31:42.448
TRAVIS: If you don't mind, I know this ship better
than anybody. Jester, would you come up with me,

00:31:42.448 --> 00:31:46.158
and we can explore the captain's quarters? Might
be a good place to start.

00:31:46.158 --> 00:31:47.583
LAURA: Of course.

00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:48.795
TALIESIN: Do you need a light?

00:31:48.795 --> 00:31:49.462
TRAVIS: No, I'm okay.

00:31:49.462 --> 00:31:50.171
TALIESIN: All right.

00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:58.559
TRAVIS: I'll drop the cannonball, and I will push
up off the ground, Superman-style, in the water,

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:01.468
and swim up above the deck.

00:32:01.468 --> 00:32:10.300
LAURA: I guess I'll let this-- okay. I let it go,
too, and float very ungracefully behind him.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:15.170
MATT: Now because you guys don't have air in your
lungs, you're not buoyant, to the point where

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.673
you're not fighting weight. It brought you to the
bottom easier, so you didn't have to swim your way

00:32:18.673 --> 00:32:23.806
underneath, but now you're here, the cannonball is
unnecessary to weigh you down.

00:32:23.806 --> 00:32:26.026
LIAM: We're Ed Harris now.

00:32:26.026 --> 00:32:33.147
MATT: Essentially. You arc over, and you land on
the deck. For a moment as you glance around, it's

00:32:33.212 --> 00:32:40.048
very spooky to be back in this familiar place in a
very different setting. It's a strange, ghost-ship

00:32:40.048 --> 00:32:45.109
type chill that runs up your back, looking around
and having flash memories of pulling up the anchor

00:32:45.109 --> 00:32:51.440
on that side, and having conversations over that
edge at sea. You and Vandren having a deep

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.564
conversation there under the main mast.

00:32:55.764 --> 00:32:59.559
TRAVIS: His quarters are that way. We should push
forward.

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:01.287
LAURA: Okay.

00:33:01.287 --> 00:33:02.716
TRAVIS: Swim over.

00:33:02.716 --> 00:33:09.605
MATT: Okay. You swim through the door. It's
currently open, and the hinges rusted and pulled

00:33:09.605 --> 00:33:16.656
off, and the tops of the doors broken and akimbo.
You make your way into the darkened interior

00:33:16.656 --> 00:33:24.719
chamber. The door to Vandren's chamber is closed.
What do you want to do?

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:26.699
LAURA: Do you think it's locked?

00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:29.651
TRAVIS: I imagine so. Could be still.

00:33:29.651 --> 00:33:31.738
LAURA: He wouldn't have trapped it or anything?

00:33:31.738 --> 00:33:38.925
TRAVIS: I would say no, but there seem to be more
than a few things that I didn't know about him.

00:33:38.925 --> 00:33:45.149
LAURA: I don't have any-- I mean, I can try to
look for traps or something, but--

00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:50.998
MATT: Yeah, go for it. Roll, let's say, a
perception, to see if you see anything strange or

00:33:50.998 --> 00:33:53.040
out of the ordinary.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.295
LAURA: 14.

00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:58.247
MATT: 14. Doesn't look like there are any traps
affixed to the door.

00:33:58.247 --> 00:34:00.886
TRAVIS: You're so strong, might want to give it
a--

00:34:00.886 --> 00:34:03.389
LAURA: (rattling)

00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:07.449
MATT: There's a bit of a rust resistance, but
you're pretty beefy. You shove it with your

00:34:07.449 --> 00:34:12.501
shoulder, and it opens up. You can see all the
silt get kicked off and slowly cloud the space

00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:15.044
around it as you push the door open.

00:34:15.044 --> 00:34:17.540
LAURA: Now I know why you asked me to come with
you.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:25.290
MATT: You step through and look inside. You see
the familiar quarters of Vandren, though they look tossed.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.415
TRAVIS: Really?

00:34:27.415 --> 00:34:35.465
MATT: As you look inside, there's the table where
he normally sat and read his books. That table is

00:34:35.465 --> 00:34:42.546
set over; the shelf is pushed over. Looks like
most everything in here has been, in some way,

00:34:42.546 --> 00:34:48.615
shape, or form, tossed. You remember there being
all sorts of decorations that he kept in here,

00:34:48.615 --> 00:34:56.095
metal candle holders. It's all missing.

00:34:56.095 --> 00:34:58.845
TRAVIS: It's all missing. Is there anything that
I--

00:34:58.845 --> 00:35:00.258
MATT: At first glance.

00:35:00.258 --> 00:35:05.853
TRAVIS: Is there anything that I see that is
definitely out of place or changed that I remember?

00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:08.368
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:35:08.368 --> 00:35:11.751
TRAVIS: Third one of the day. Let's go with this
dice. Natural one.

00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:14.889
MATT: Oh, buddy.

00:35:14.889 --> 00:35:16.319
SAM: You're nervous down there.

00:35:16.319 --> 00:35:19.748
TRAVIS: Apparently. You can pee down here and
nobody'd notice.

00:35:19.748 --> 00:35:23.729
MATT: You just stand in the doorway, as opposed to
doing a thorough investigation of the room, and

00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:30.597
glance around, and begin tying memories and
moments, and getting lost in that headspace. You

00:35:30.597 --> 00:35:35.226
do a not-very-thorough check over the interior.

00:35:35.226 --> 00:35:41.754
TRAVIS: Maybe we should get the others and-- what
fucking? Extra?

00:35:41.754 --> 00:35:44.181
LIAM: She's giving you your pills.

00:35:44.181 --> 00:35:48.398
TRAVIS: I'm always eating stuff. Maybe we should
get some of the others to come in and do a more--

00:35:48.398 --> 00:35:51.439
LAURA: Thorough investigation?

00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:52.456
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:35:52.456 --> 00:35:53.939
LAURA: I mean, okay.

00:35:53.939 --> 00:35:56.655
TRAVIS: Unless you want to give it a look?

00:35:56.655 --> 00:36:00.894
LAURA: Does it look like somebody stole things
from here?

00:36:00.894 --> 00:36:05.882
TRAVIS: Yeah. He was a tidy man; he certainly
wouldn't have left things like this. It looks

00:36:05.882 --> 00:36:11.250
like, either before or after it went down,
somebody was definitely fucking looking for something.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:16.598
LAURA: Do you know if he kept anything in a secret
place?

00:36:16.598 --> 00:36:19.910
TRAVIS: Do I? I don't think I do.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.704
LAURA: Because maybe he took it all with him.
Maybe he left.

00:36:22.704 --> 00:36:34.402
TRAVIS: Could be. Yeah. I'll go get Caduceus and
Caleb.

00:36:34.402 --> 00:36:36.255
LAURA: Beau is really good at finding things, I
think.

00:36:36.255 --> 00:36:37.726
TRAVIS: I'll go get everybody.

00:36:37.726 --> 00:36:40.390
LAURA: I'll keep looking around the room while
he--

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:44.277
MATT: Okay, you're doing a thorough investigation
of the interior? Roll an investigation check as

00:36:44.277 --> 00:36:47.701
you rummage through the wreckage.

00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:50.167
LAURA: 13.

00:36:50.167 --> 00:36:58.773
MATT: Okay. Looking through and moving some things
aside because you're a sturdy tiefling, pushing

00:36:58.773 --> 00:37:06.476
things out of the way while you're off, you glance
underneath the table in the far left corner. You

00:37:06.476 --> 00:37:19.769
see a reinforced metal box, somewhat melted along
one edge, just faintly. It's left open. The lock

00:37:19.769 --> 00:37:26.897
mechanism on it appears to have been broken by
brute force. Where it was forced open, there are

00:37:26.897 --> 00:37:34.015
some heavy claw marks along the edges where the
metal itself looks scarred. The interior, as you

00:37:34.015 --> 00:37:40.385
pull it open and look inside, is set with a
leather recess on each side, top and bottom, soft

00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:49.593
leather with two halves that are somewhat
spherical, like to hold a small apple.

00:37:49.593 --> 00:38:04.116
LAURA: Oh no. It got taken. Fjord's going to be so
upset. Can I cast Locate Object and see if I can

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:07.246
sense the orb around within a thousand feet?

00:38:07.246 --> 00:38:24.568
MATT: Yeah. You cast Locate Object, concentrating
on the orb. Let me have a quick glance at this.

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:29.136
LIAM: Is one the same as another?

00:38:29.136 --> 00:38:30.844
MATT: All right.

00:38:30.844 --> 00:38:34.509
SAM: If you find the orb, you should totally bond
with it and get all the water powers that Fjord wants.

00:38:34.509 --> 00:38:36.111
LAURA: Oh my god, that would be so amazing.

00:38:36.111 --> 00:38:37.384
LIAM: She already has them.

00:38:37.384 --> 00:38:40.902
SAM: Just because.

00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:45.969
MATT: Okay, so you're not looking for the orb that
Fjord has, something similar to it?

00:38:45.969 --> 00:38:46.666
LAURA: Right.

00:38:46.666 --> 00:38:55.103
MATT: Okay. You do suddenly acknowledge-- your
head pulls at the back of your skull, and you

00:38:55.103 --> 00:38:59.120
glance over your shoulder away from the ship.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.352
LAURA: (gasping)

00:39:01.352 --> 00:39:03.423
SAM: Hello?

00:39:03.423 --> 00:39:06.814
MATT: Just as everyone else returns and comes in
the chamber.

00:39:06.814 --> 00:39:07.541
LAURA: Fjord!

00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:08.621
TALIESIN: Well, this is a mess.

00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:09.302
LAURA: Fjord!

00:39:09.302 --> 00:39:09.991
TRAVIS: What?

00:39:09.991 --> 00:39:11.935
LAURA: It got taken. The orb is gone.

00:39:11.935 --> 00:39:12.466
TRAVIS: No.

00:39:12.466 --> 00:39:14.342
LAURA: Yeah, but it's over there!

00:39:14.342 --> 00:39:16.523
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

00:39:16.523 --> 00:39:22.833
LAURA: My spidey sense is tingling. It's behind
us. It's over there. I used Locate Object.

00:39:22.833 --> 00:39:27.532
TRAVIS: That's amazing! Lead the way!

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:29.723
LAURA: You want to go now? You don't want to look
around or any--?

00:39:29.723 --> 00:39:30.988
TRAVIS: No, let's go now!

00:39:30.988 --> 00:39:34.488
SAM: You dragged us in here to look around, and
now we're not going to look around?

00:39:34.488 --> 00:39:37.612
TALIESIN: I think doing a once-over might not be a
bad idea.

00:39:37.612 --> 00:39:40.548
MARISHA: Why don't you guys go get a head start
and we'll--

00:39:40.548 --> 00:39:41.877
LIAM: In the ocean? Let's take--

00:39:41.877 --> 00:39:46.074
LAURA: Locate Object lasts ten minutes. If it
takes longer to get there, then--

00:39:46.074 --> 00:39:46.836
MARISHA: You guys go.

00:39:46.836 --> 00:39:48.108
LAURA: We'll come back.

00:39:48.108 --> 00:39:49.738
MARISHA: We'll check it out real quick.

00:39:49.738 --> 00:39:55.255
TALIESIN: Maybe bring the little octopi with you?

00:39:55.255 --> 00:39:58.503
LIAM: Yeah, I schloof Frumpkin to the back of
Caduceus' head.

00:39:58.503 --> 00:40:00.188
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay, that's a--

00:40:00.188 --> 00:40:03.224
MATT: (slurping) The tentacles wrap around and
grasp.

00:40:03.224 --> 00:40:05.111
TALIESIN: That's-- okay.

00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:09.616
MATT: It's like a reverse facehugger.

00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:11.291
LAURA: Who's coming with Fjord?

00:40:11.512 --> 00:40:12.857
TALIESIN: I think we should probably all stick
together, one way or the other.

00:40:12.857 --> 00:40:14.048
LAURA: I think all of us should go.

00:40:14.048 --> 00:40:16.112
TRAVIS: Do you know how far away it was?

00:40:16.112 --> 00:40:17.961
LAURA: Within a thousand feet.

00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:27.714
MATT: Roughly, the direction you know, you sense
it's probably between seven to eight hundred feet

00:40:27.714 --> 00:40:29.375
from your current location.

00:40:29.375 --> 00:40:35.592
TRAVIS: All right. Yes. Fine. Take five minutes,
six minutes, and--

00:40:35.592 --> 00:40:36.469
LAURA: No!

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:41.066
LIAM: While they're debating I spit out four
globules of light and start casing the room.

00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:41.829
MATT: Okay.

00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:43.360
LAURA: You have two minutes!

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.323
TALIESIN: I'm going to let the flora and fauna in
here know that we're looking for some stuff. One

00:40:48.323 --> 00:40:52.068
of our people used to live here. We'll be gone,
and everything's going to be fine.

00:40:52.068 --> 00:41:01.167
MARISHA: I'll do a quick glance for anything that
looks like it could have loose boards, secret compartments.

00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:02.495
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:05.917
LAURA: While they're looking, I want to point out
to everyone that whatever it was that took this

00:41:05.917 --> 00:41:12.195
ball has claws, and it looks like it could break
this thing open. It looks like it might do some

00:41:12.195 --> 00:41:13.497
damage to us.

00:41:13.497 --> 00:41:15.410
TRAVIS: Is it dented at all, or just scratched?

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:18.276
TALIESIN: How big a creature does it look like was
taking a--?

00:41:18.276 --> 00:41:20.359
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:41:20.359 --> 00:41:23.275
TRAVIS: Yeah, like an inch between the claw marks
or a couple inches?

00:41:23.275 --> 00:41:24.802
LIAM: 21 on investigation.

00:41:24.802 --> 00:41:25.435
MARISHA: 19.

00:41:25.435 --> 00:41:26.316
MATT: Okay.

00:41:26.316 --> 00:41:27.025
TALIESIN: 14.

00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:35.206
MATT: Okay. Looking at it, the claw marks are
probably roughly an inch to an inch and a half

00:41:35.416 --> 00:41:41.089
apart, and there's four of them. It looks like an
indentation for a thumb across one side, almost

00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:46.734
like whoever was grabbing it was pulling it open
this way and, as they pulled it open, their

00:41:46.734 --> 00:41:50.009
fingers scratched across the metal as it bent and
broke open.

00:41:50.009 --> 00:41:50.910
LAURA: It's bad.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.953
TRAVIS: While they're doing this, you can tell if
it moves, right?

00:41:54.953 --> 00:41:55.816
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:41:55.816 --> 00:41:57.017
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:41:57.017 --> 00:42:02.820
MARISHA: They mentioned that Dashilla has claws
that grasp. Just throwing that out there. Really

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.173
committed that song to memory.

00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:05.818
SAM: Hungry eye, claws, yeah.

00:42:05.818 --> 00:42:07.459
MARISHA: Claws that grasp.

00:42:07.459 --> 00:42:10.153
TRAVIS: Glad you remembered that. I'm kind of
forgetful.

00:42:10.153 --> 00:42:19.981
MATT: As you guys finish doing your once-over of
the chamber, you find a false shelf bottom under

00:42:20.212 --> 00:42:27.502
one of the bookcases that was toppled over. As you
pull inside, it looks like it may have been what

00:42:27.502 --> 00:42:35.128
this box was inside. It has been pulled open and
broken, the wood compartment partially shattered

00:42:35.128 --> 00:42:41.317
in the front. Looking through, this room has been
pretty ransacked.

00:42:41.317 --> 00:42:44.060
LIAM: The books are basically mud at this point,
correct?

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:51.264
MATT: Yeah, what remains of the handful of bound
leather tomes in the vicinity have mostly joined

00:42:51.264 --> 00:42:52.519
the muck at the bottom of the ocean.

00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:54.171
TRAVIS: Here, underwater? Yeah.

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.147
TALIESIN: Maybe it's time to--

00:42:56.147 --> 00:43:00.333
TRAVIS: Might be. Did you find anything
underneath? Any remnants of that explosion,

00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:02.168
package, shrapnel, anything like that?

00:43:02.168 --> 00:43:05.984
TALIESIN: Just a little walk around, just to get a
sense of the place.

00:43:05.984 --> 00:43:13.870
MATT: Okay. Going through, you go through a number
of cabins, chambers. This isn't an incredibly

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:22.235
massive ship. It was mainly used for sailing and
for transport. It's strange for you to go back,

00:43:22.235 --> 00:43:29.013
once again, following through Caduceus and looking
and finding your old chambers as well. A lot of

00:43:29.013 --> 00:43:38.137
the rooms from the explosion have been destroyed.
Because of your generally perceptive persona, you

00:43:38.137 --> 00:43:44.413
can see elements where this explosion happened.
There are stains of individuals that may have been

00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:46.769
in the proximity, but no sign of their bodies.

00:43:46.769 --> 00:43:47.659
TALIESIN: Hm. No.

00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:56.229
MATT: You begin to piece together the power and
the source of this detonation, and you get caught

00:43:56.229 --> 00:44:00.914
up slightly thumbing through the memories and
remembering the people and the faces that used to

00:44:00.914 --> 00:44:11.828
serve on this ship with you. Remembering the room
where Sabian stayed. Wondering, if Sabian

00:44:11.828 --> 00:44:18.547
survived, who else may have? But he also was the
one jumping from the deck when the explosion hit.

00:44:18.547 --> 00:44:27.982
Everything has been cleaned out. This appears
salvaged. Somebody has come through here and taken

00:44:27.982 --> 00:44:29.553
from the interior.

00:44:29.553 --> 00:44:35.201
TRAVIS: I think it's safe to assume that that was
done after the ship sunk. A hole this size

00:44:35.201 --> 00:44:37.312
wouldn't keep a vessel in the water very long.

00:44:37.312 --> 00:44:48.658
MARISHA: No. Do we know anything about underwater
creatures that would be interested in, I don't know--

00:44:48.658 --> 00:44:51.059
TRAVIS: Glowing eyes?

00:44:51.059 --> 00:44:53.950
MARISHA: Yeah. Jewels?

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.115
TRAVIS: Pretties?

00:44:55.115 --> 00:44:56.501
MARISHA: Underwater goblins?

00:44:56.501 --> 00:45:00.474
MATT: I mean, there are a number of creatures of
folklore and things that are greedy no matter

00:45:00.474 --> 00:45:02.565
where they live.

00:45:02.565 --> 00:45:04.312
TRAVIS: Locate Ariel.

00:45:04.312 --> 00:45:06.585
MARISHA: Yeah, mermaids? I don't know.

00:45:06.585 --> 00:45:07.886
MATT: Make a history check.

00:45:07.886 --> 00:45:10.618
LIAM: It could also be someone who was having
dreams, Fjord.

00:45:10.618 --> 00:45:12.775
TRAVIS: True. Very true.

00:45:12.775 --> 00:45:14.865
MARISHA: 18.

00:45:14.865 --> 00:45:24.512
MATT: I mean, there was one other time that you
encountered creatures that seemed to be gathering

00:45:24.512 --> 00:45:34.856
and hoarding things that were shiny and happened
to be affiliated with underwater existence.

00:45:34.856 --> 00:45:36.304
MARISHA: Yeah, right.

00:45:36.304 --> 00:45:43.314
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I can't wait any longer. Do you
mind if we go? This is all too strange.

00:45:43.314 --> 00:45:45.281
LAURA: Be on guard.

00:45:45.281 --> 00:45:48.185
MATT: Where are you exiting?

00:45:48.185 --> 00:45:54.974
TRAVIS: Fuck it, we'll go back up above deck, and
we'll jump off the stern in the direction that Jester--

00:45:54.974 --> 00:45:57.358
MATT: Okay, make a perception check for me.

00:45:57.358 --> 00:46:00.332
LAURA: Are the globules of light around?

00:46:00.332 --> 00:46:05.161
LIAM: If we are in a group, they are. They were
around the group.

00:46:05.161 --> 00:46:06.707
TRAVIS: Goddamn it!

00:46:06.707 --> 00:46:08.861
LAURA: That's why I said switch to a fucking dice
that I gave you!

00:46:08.861 --> 00:46:11.657
LIAM: Take your pills, Travis. Take your pills.

00:46:11.657 --> 00:46:13.104
TRAVIS: Three.

00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:26.011
MATT: In your excitement in having this thread of
possibility towards recovering this third and

00:46:26.163 --> 00:46:33.563
final orb, from what you understand, you
immediately turn around and swim and dart outward

00:46:33.563 --> 00:46:40.145
towards where the deck is, into the open waters,
just as your eyes clarify to see three large

00:46:40.145 --> 00:46:46.967
figures that are floating about 20 or so feet
ahead that seems to have encircled the deck. In

00:46:46.967 --> 00:46:51.644
but a split second, you can immediately make out
their outline. You can see the sides of the

00:46:51.644 --> 00:46:58.603
frilled head. You can see the long, fish-like
lower torso, and you can see the familiar tridents

00:46:58.603 --> 00:47:00.413
with chains affixed to the edge.

00:47:00.413 --> 00:47:03.046
LAURA: Fuck! Now we're underwater with them?

00:47:03.046 --> 00:47:04.792
MARISHA: Now we're going to fight underwater?

00:47:04.792 --> 00:47:05.992
MATT: Let's roll initiative.

00:47:05.992 --> 00:47:07.443
TRAVIS: Oh no!

00:47:07.443 --> 00:47:13.819
MATT: It seems that, in these darkened waters,
light sources can be very easy to see.

00:47:13.819 --> 00:47:16.384
LAURA: Shit, shit, shit.

00:47:16.384 --> 00:47:19.426
LIAM: How about a high roll? Nope.

00:47:19.426 --> 00:47:23.690
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good.

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.843
LAURA: Shit, shit, shit balls, shit.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:32.931
SAM: Guys, Backblaze can back up your stuff.
Whoa!

00:47:32.931 --> 00:47:36.344
LAURA: Wow, this is so cool, Matthew!

00:47:36.344 --> 00:47:39.433
SAM: Someone went to the aquatic store.

00:47:39.433 --> 00:47:41.330
TALIESIN: Thank you, Petco!

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:42.391
TRAVIS: Yeah, dude.

00:47:42.391 --> 00:47:45.689
LAURA: Look at that cool-ass busted-up ship.

00:47:45.689 --> 00:47:48.186
SAM: Did you bust up the ship, or does it come
busted up?

00:47:48.186 --> 00:47:49.527
MATT: It came like this, busted up.

00:47:49.527 --> 00:47:51.047
LAURA and SAM: What!

00:47:51.047 --> 00:47:54.903
MATT: Marching order, if you don't mind, of who
was behind Fjord.

00:47:54.903 --> 00:47:56.551
TRAVIS: I'll let y'all crawl up.

00:47:56.551 --> 00:47:58.074
LAURA: I would have been close behind because--

00:47:58.074 --> 00:48:00.756
LIAM: (singing) Caleb takes the rear.

00:48:00.756 --> 00:48:04.096
MATT: Yasha probably right behind there.

00:48:04.096 --> 00:48:06.545
MARISHA: I'll be behind Yasha.

00:48:06.545 --> 00:48:09.063
MATT: All right. Caleb takes the rear.

00:48:09.063 --> 00:48:14.229
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know if I was quite
outside yet. I think Beau and I maybe switch

00:48:14.229 --> 00:48:16.352
places, if that's okay.

00:48:16.352 --> 00:48:18.062
MATT: Beau said she was behind Yasha.

00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.001
MARISHA: Well, I can switch with Cad.

00:48:20.001 --> 00:48:28.105
MATT: That's up to you. Fine. Caduceus inside
there. All right, then there's Beau. And Nott?

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:31.058
SAM: I'm way back there, not even looking.

00:48:31.058 --> 00:48:33.100
MATT: Chilling with Caleb. All right.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.688
TRAVIS: Wanting to be drunk, but not really.

00:48:35.688 --> 00:48:37.277
SAM: Oh, I'm drunk.

00:48:37.277 --> 00:48:39.441
LAURA: Are you? How are you drunk?

00:48:39.441 --> 00:48:41.166
MARISHA: He's dehydrated.

00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:44.314
SAM: I got drunk before we came underwater. That's
the only way I could go underwater.

00:48:44.314 --> 00:48:54.000
LAURA: Oh no. These trident things are really bad.
Do you remember how bad they are?

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:54.999
SAM: No!

00:48:54.999 --> 00:48:56.534
MARISHA: Don't they have harpoon chains?

00:48:56.534 --> 00:48:58.071
LAURA: Yeah!

00:48:58.071 --> 00:49:02.129
MATT: Initiative order, please. 25 to 20, anyone?

00:49:02.129 --> 00:49:03.954
TALIESIN: Crickets.

00:49:03.954 --> 00:49:05.404
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

00:49:05.404 --> 00:49:06.643
MATT: 20 to 15?

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:07.631
LAURA: 15.

00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:09.244
TRAVIS: Yasha got a 17.

00:49:09.244 --> 00:49:10.229
MARISHA: 15.

00:49:10.229 --> 00:49:12.566
MATT: Yasha got 17? All right.

00:49:12.566 --> 00:49:14.239
TRAVIS: Wow, that's high for her.

00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:24.874
MATT: All right. Then 15 for Beau and Jester? All
right. 15 to ten?

00:49:24.874 --> 00:49:25.620
TRAVIS: 14.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.221
MATT: 14 for Fjord.

00:49:27.221 --> 00:49:30.978
TRAVIS: Fuck! Guys!

00:49:30.978 --> 00:49:32.481
MATT: All right, ten to five?

00:49:32.481 --> 00:49:33.957
LIAM: Sechs.

00:49:33.957 --> 00:49:35.169
SAM: Seven.

00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:36.959
MATT: All right.

00:49:36.959 --> 00:49:38.568
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

00:49:38.568 --> 00:49:40.050
MATT: Caduceus?

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:40.886
TALIESIN: Four.

00:49:40.886 --> 00:49:43.134
MATT: All righty.

00:49:43.134 --> 00:49:48.291
TRAVIS: Yeah. Good start. Here we go! The pendulum
swings wildly.

00:49:48.291 --> 00:49:50.071
MARISHA: From where we were last week.

00:49:50.071 --> 00:49:54.078
MATT: Great. Top of the round, first up is Yasha.

00:49:54.078 --> 00:49:59.733
TRAVIS: Yeah, she is! Right, yeah, and she is back
there? Oh, and there they are. Okay, lovely.

00:49:59.733 --> 00:50:03.084
Underwater, is her speed halved?

00:50:03.084 --> 00:50:04.979
MATT: Everyone's speed is halved underwater.

00:50:04.979 --> 00:50:06.152
TRAVIS: Except mine.

00:50:06.152 --> 00:50:07.021
MATT: Except yours.

00:50:07.021 --> 00:50:12.195
TRAVIS: My armor. Wow, good fucking deal. Okay.

00:50:12.195 --> 00:50:18.026
MARISHA: Man, this sucks. How are we supposed to
get to those assholes? We can swim!

00:50:18.026 --> 00:50:26.459
TRAVIS: How far in this diagonal movement would 20
feet get Yasha towards the nearest enemy?

00:50:26.459 --> 00:50:29.419
MATT: Her movement speed is 40, right?

00:50:29.419 --> 00:50:30.234
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:30.234 --> 00:50:36.981
MATT: 20 feet would get her almost into melee with
this one.

00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:37.892
TRAVIS: Almost?

00:50:37.892 --> 00:50:41.336
MATT: Yeah, just outside of it.

00:50:41.336 --> 00:50:50.562
TRAVIS: Okay, she will swim towards that merrow,
and with her bonus action, she would like to rage.

00:50:50.562 --> 00:50:52.529
SAM: Underwater rage.

00:50:52.529 --> 00:50:56.021
MATT: All right, so rage. Then she can use her
action to dash and move again if she's not

00:50:56.021 --> 00:50:57.445
attacking with it.

00:50:57.445 --> 00:50:59.515
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, then let's do that and get within
melee.

00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:03.532
MATT: All right, she gets into melee with that
figure there. You got it. That finishes Yasha's

00:51:03.532 --> 00:51:06.350
go. Beau and Jester, your turns.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:07.855
MARISHA: You want to go first?

00:51:07.855 --> 00:51:11.274
LAURA: Sure. I'll use Guiding Bolt.

00:51:11.274 --> 00:51:13.525
MATT: All right. Against which one?

00:51:13.525 --> 00:51:17.420
LAURA: The one that Yasha's attacking.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.138
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for an attack.

00:51:19.138 --> 00:51:21.930
TRAVIS: As a point of order, can she also yell,
"Don't let them leave!"

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:23.056
LAURA: Yasha?

00:51:23.056 --> 00:51:24.334
MATT: Sure.

00:51:24.334 --> 00:51:28.479
MARISHA: They always bring more friends.

00:51:28.479 --> 00:51:31.056
LAURA: 16?

00:51:31.056 --> 00:51:33.904
MATT: 16 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that
one.

00:51:33.904 --> 00:51:35.614
TRAVIS: That was more Caleb than Yasha, but--

00:51:35.614 --> 00:51:38.403
SAM: Don't let them leave!

00:51:38.403 --> 00:51:44.435
LAURA: 4d6! That's cocked.

00:51:44.435 --> 00:51:45.635
MATT: Slightly Norse.

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:47.173
TRAVIS: That's it.

00:51:47.173 --> 00:51:50.653
LAURA: 11, 15, 17 points.

00:51:50.653 --> 00:51:55.489
MATT: Nice! That one, next attack on it has
advantage.

00:51:55.489 --> 00:51:56.238
LAURA: Yes.

00:51:56.238 --> 00:52:02.272
MATT: As Yasha says that, Jester glances over,
puts her hand out. This sparkling, radiant light

00:52:02.272 --> 00:52:07.655
goes through the water, leaving this vacuum trail
behind as the bolt slams into the merrow,

00:52:07.655 --> 00:52:12.437
brightening up around its chest with the impact of
the magical energy. Now its form is glittering

00:52:12.437 --> 00:52:17.754
with that light, making it very easy to spot its
location. Do you want to move or stay where you are?

00:52:17.754 --> 00:52:20.610
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to back up.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.653
MATT: Back up back inside?

00:52:23.653 --> 00:52:26.965
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

00:52:26.965 --> 00:52:29.840
MATT: You move inside the chamber there. Okay.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.918
LAURA: To be not within five feet of Caleb. I want
to be against the wall of whatever that--

00:52:33.918 --> 00:52:36.167
yeah, like that.

00:52:36.167 --> 00:52:40.419
MATT: You got it. That ends your turn. Beau, what
are you doing?

00:52:40.419 --> 00:52:47.751
MARISHA: Am I within 20 feet of the guy that she
just marked? If I swim up?

00:52:47.751 --> 00:52:53.101
MATT: You have 25 feet. You can get right up to
it. I'll shift these guys here a little bit to

00:52:53.101 --> 00:52:55.194
make a space for it where they were.

00:52:55.194 --> 00:52:58.262
MARISHA: I jump off and parkour off.

00:52:58.262 --> 00:53:00.345
SAM: Slow motion parkour!

00:53:00.345 --> 00:53:06.997
MARISHA: I get really frustrated, and so I dog
paddle the rest of the way. Then I'm going to take my--

00:53:06.997 --> 00:53:08.580
MATT: Is your speed 50, then?

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.720
MARISHA: No, it's 45. That's why I was saying 20
feet.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.133
MATT: Oh, got you. So it would be 20 feet because
you round down in D&amp;amp;D unless it specially says

00:53:14.133 --> 00:53:16.744
otherwise. So you'd be just out of range.

00:53:16.744 --> 00:53:19.789
MARISHA: Then let me spend a ki point to do Step
of the Wind.

00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:21.508
MATT: All right, that'll get you the distance you
need there.

00:53:21.508 --> 00:53:25.366
MARISHA: Which sucks, but that's okay. Then I'm
going to attack.

00:53:25.366 --> 00:53:26.753
MATT: (singing) Do it!

00:53:26.753 --> 00:53:31.808
MARISHA: Just jam my staff into its face. Not too
bad. 22.

00:53:31.808 --> 00:53:33.322
MATT: 22 hits.

00:53:33.322 --> 00:53:37.372
MARISHA: Okay. That's good. Ten.

00:53:37.372 --> 00:53:42.288
MATT: Ten points of damage. You have advantage on
that attack, by the way, because of the Guiding Bolt.

00:53:42.288 --> 00:53:48.618
MARISHA: Let's see if it's a natural 20. It is not
a natural 20. Then, okay, hang on, I used my bonus

00:53:48.618 --> 00:53:50.559
action. Oh, I get one more hit.

00:53:50.559 --> 00:53:52.955
LIAM: Cocked.

00:53:52.955 --> 00:53:56.300
MATT: You do not have advantage on that one. Only
the first one.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.087
MARISHA and LIAM: It was cocked.

00:53:58.087 --> 00:53:58.849
MATT: Oh, got you.

00:53:58.849 --> 00:54:01.182
MARISHA: That's not good, though. That is 12.

00:54:01.182 --> 00:54:05.732
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately. The first strike
manages to clock it in the face. However, as you

00:54:05.732 --> 00:54:10.418
go to swing backward, the water resistance in
itself-- which, actually, this is a good point of

00:54:10.418 --> 00:54:15.464
order. Remember, you're underwater. Remember this
going forward; melee attacks and weapon attacks

00:54:15.464 --> 00:54:16.840
have disadvantage.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.641
(groaning)

00:54:18.641 --> 00:54:28.190
TRAVIS: Fuck a duck. Yeah, okay, that changes
shit. That's got to go. Oh, boy. Oh, yeah.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:31.232
TALIESIN: I mean, it means your advantage cancels
that out, though, so--

00:54:31.232 --> 00:54:35.984
MATT: A melee weapon attack. Ranged weapon attacks
automatically miss if they're beyond the normal

00:54:35.984 --> 00:54:41.537
range. The attack roll has disadvantage unless the
weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that's

00:54:41.537 --> 00:54:45.827
thrown like a javelin. So technically, Nott, your
attacks are fine underwater.

00:54:45.827 --> 00:54:47.038
LAURA: But magic attacks are fine.

00:54:47.038 --> 00:54:50.356
MATT: Magic attacks are fine, but melee weapon
attacks have disadvantage.

00:54:50.356 --> 00:54:53.243
MARISHA: Who is that next to me? Is that Yasha?

00:54:53.243 --> 00:54:54.427
MATT and LAURA: Yeah.

00:54:54.427 --> 00:54:59.987
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to spend another ki point
to do Patient Defense.

00:54:59.987 --> 00:55:02.122
MATT: You've already used your bonus action to--

00:55:02.122 --> 00:55:05.958
MARISHA: Oh, shit. Sorry, you're right. I forgot
that that's not a free action. Okay, I'm done.

00:55:05.958 --> 00:55:10.594
MATT: No worries. After the resistance of the
water keeps your blow from coming with too much

00:55:10.594 --> 00:55:19.304
impact, the merrow spins to you. As its jaw opens,
there's the rows of tiny, sharp teeth. It's creepy

00:55:19.304 --> 00:55:24.242
when it's right in front of you. These are
similar, but different than the ones you fought

00:55:24.242 --> 00:55:29.334
before up at the swamp. These have longer, more
sallow features. They seem to be a little bit more

00:55:29.334 --> 00:55:35.504
ocean-based, and as such, there's a variation to
how they look. That finishes Jester's and Beau's

00:55:35.504 --> 00:55:37.352
turn. Fjord, you're up.

00:55:37.352 --> 00:55:45.175
TRAVIS: I will, with my bonus action, cast
Hexblade's Curse on this merrow, the one that's in

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:52.458
the middle, and I will fire two Eldritch Blasts at
it.

00:55:52.458 --> 00:55:53.713
MATT: Go for it.

00:55:53.713 --> 00:55:58.035
SAM and TRAVIS: (drawn out) Eldritch Blasts.

00:55:58.035 --> 00:56:03.122
TRAVIS: Oh, they're both 18s. So 25 to hit both.

00:56:03.122 --> 00:56:04.226
MATT: Both hit!

00:56:04.226 --> 00:56:18.193
TRAVIS: Four, so that's 12 points of damage. The
second one is nine points of damage, so 21.

00:56:18.193 --> 00:56:23.190
MATT: It gets hit twice in the chest. It tries to
loop around now. You can see the shapes against

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:28.420
the little bit of light you can see from the
surface above, but it's still very dark in the

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.555
vicinity aside from the globes he has behind.

00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:36.464
TRAVIS: Actually, you gain plus three to damage
rolls on Hexblade's Curse, so instead of 21--

00:56:36.464 --> 00:56:38.088
MATT: Oh, so you cursed that guy?

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:45.504
TRAVIS: Yeah, with my bonus action, I did that
first. So 22 total, so add three. With my

00:56:45.709 --> 00:56:51.447
movement, I will move back under the deck where
Caduceus and Caleb and Jester are.

00:56:51.447 --> 00:56:53.964
MATT: You going to stay in the doorway or move
into the chamber?

00:56:53.964 --> 00:56:55.370
TRAVIS: One step in.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:58.853
MATT: All right. One step into the room?

00:56:58.853 --> 00:56:59.791
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:01.359
MATT: Okay, so you'd still be there.

00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:05.608
TRAVIS: Not so I'm blocking the entry, but just so
that I'm in, out of thrown-harpoon way, you know

00:57:05.608 --> 00:57:06.613
what I mean?

00:57:06.613 --> 00:57:11.026
MATT: Okay, so you probably move that way then.
That ends your go. That brings us to their turn.

00:57:11.026 --> 00:57:11.991
SAM: Oh no.

00:57:11.991 --> 00:57:18.112
MATT: This one right there in the front, it's
going to make-- let's see here.

00:57:18.112 --> 00:57:20.109
SAM: 16 attacks.

00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:26.003
MATT: One bite with its claw and one with its bite
against, I'm going to say you, since you're the

00:57:26.003 --> 00:57:29.437
only one who actually managed to connect with it
physically. As you rush up into its face and slam

00:57:29.437 --> 00:57:34.678
it once, the other attack misses as it curves
under. It goes (snarling). Its jaw opens to try

00:57:34.678 --> 00:57:37.019
and snap towards your shoulder and neck area.

00:57:37.019 --> 00:57:38.577
MARISHA: Yasha gets a sentinel attack, yeah?

00:57:38.577 --> 00:57:39.966
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

00:57:39.966 --> 00:57:43.124
MATT: No, they do not because they both have
sentinel. We have to remember that!

00:57:43.124 --> 00:57:44.319
MARISHA: Fuck!

00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.729
TRAVIS: If they both have sentinel--?

00:57:45.729 --> 00:57:48.273
MATT: Yeah, if they both have sentinel, they can't
bounce attacks. We kept forgetting that in the past.

00:57:48.273 --> 00:57:49.717
MARISHA: You can't do that, technically.

00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:51.935
LIAM: There's too much awesome in one spot.

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:53.386
MARISHA: That's literally what it is.

00:57:53.386 --> 00:57:57.877
MATT: Because the combination becomes super
broken. That's going to be a--

00:57:57.877 --> 00:58:01.734
LAURA: Don't attack the same thing, you guys!

00:58:01.734 --> 00:58:03.100
MATT: 19 to hit.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.410
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:11.567
MATT: All right, and then the claw attack. Ooh,
that's going to be a 22 to hit. You suffer from

00:58:11.567 --> 00:58:15.830
the bite attack nine points of piercing damage.

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:17.561
MARISHA: Suffer me the little merrow.

00:58:17.561 --> 00:58:24.187
MATT: Then the claws deal ten points of slashing
damage.

00:58:24.187 --> 00:58:25.469
MARISHA: All right.

00:58:25.469 --> 00:58:31.851
MATT: It's going to attempt to move out of the way
of each of you because it doesn't know any better.

00:58:31.851 --> 00:58:37.913
It has a swim speed of 40 feet, so it's going to
attempt to pull back to get some range. You each

00:58:37.913 --> 00:58:39.586
technically get an attack of opportunity on it.

00:58:39.586 --> 00:58:40.841
MARISHA: Pop pop.

00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:42.895
MATT: It's hoping. Disadvantage on each attack.

00:58:42.895 --> 00:58:44.685
TRAVIS: I'll make it reckless.

00:58:44.685 --> 00:58:46.987
MATT: You can't make-- reckless you have to do on
your turn, I think.

00:58:46.987 --> 00:58:50.144
MARISHA: One was a natural 20 from Gil.

00:58:50.144 --> 00:58:51.839
MATT: What was the other?

00:58:51.839 --> 00:58:59.124
MARISHA: Can't use it. It was a seven. 14 for me.

00:58:59.124 --> 00:59:01.212
SAM: Oh, that's not bad.

00:59:01.212 --> 00:59:03.042
MATT: 14 hits.

00:59:03.042 --> 00:59:05.316
MARISHA and LAURA: Yay!

00:59:05.316 --> 00:59:06.737
TALIESIN: Good to know.

00:59:06.737 --> 00:59:11.284
MATT: Reckless attack: When you make your first
attack on your turn. So you have to choose it on

00:59:11.284 --> 00:59:12.051
your turn.

00:59:12.051 --> 00:59:14.200
TRAVIS: Got you. 19 to hit.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.961
MATT: 19 still hits! Yeah. You both can attack,
and it does not move. It tries to pull away, and--

00:59:17.961 --> 00:59:20.898
MARISHA: That's right, because sentinel!
(cheering)

00:59:20.898 --> 00:59:22.185
MATT: There you go. See, now it pays off.

00:59:22.185 --> 00:59:24.910
TRAVIS: 13 points of slashing damage.

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:27.103
MARISHA: 11 points of damage from me.

00:59:27.103 --> 00:59:29.225
LAURA: Punching damage!

00:59:29.225 --> 00:59:30.358
MARISHA: Of punching damage, yeah.

00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:34.368
MATT: It tries to back away, hoping that the water
itself will help protect it to pull away. Nuh-uh.

00:59:34.368 --> 00:59:38.810
The two ladies are not going to let it flee.
Whack! One hit from Beau as Yasha, through the

00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:42.571
water, carves with the greatsword, Magician's
Judge, hitting across the chest. You can see this

00:59:42.571 --> 00:59:49.388
deep red cloud form around its chest as it tries
to pull away. You hold it in place, unable to escape.

00:59:49.388 --> 00:59:51.043
MARISHA: Just like the opening title sequence, you
guys.

00:59:51.043 --> 00:59:52.507
MATT: There you go.

00:59:52.507 --> 00:59:55.548
LAURA: Yeah, I know. I was about to say!

00:59:55.548 --> 00:59:56.391
MARISHA: So good!

00:59:56.391 --> 01:00:01.776
MATT: This one that's hexed is going to move down
towards the deck. It'll glance through and it sees

01:00:01.776 --> 01:00:14.568
Caleb. It's going to move in a little closer to
Caleb and as it pulls its harpoon back, it throws

01:00:14.568 --> 01:00:20.818
it forward towards you. It's going to attempt to
harpoon you, Caleb. That is a 19 to hit.

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:22.631
(groaning)

01:00:22.631 --> 01:00:24.885
LIAM: I-- shite-- take it.

01:00:24.885 --> 01:00:28.222
LAURA: But you're going to get harpooned in!
You'll be grappled!

01:00:28.222 --> 01:00:29.985
LIAM: There's nothing to do about it.

01:00:29.985 --> 01:00:33.895
MATT: You take 11 points of piercing damage. I'm
going to need you to make a strength check.

01:00:33.895 --> 01:00:35.368
LIAM: I'm good at those.

01:00:35.368 --> 01:00:37.470
SAM: Oh, that's your best. You'll be fine.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:39.590
MATT: It's contested.

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:42.929
LIAM: That's a six.

01:00:42.929 --> 01:00:48.095
MATT: Yeah. You get pulled out of the interior.

01:00:48.095 --> 01:00:49.327
LAURA: No!

01:00:49.327 --> 01:00:51.743
LIAM: How much did I get harpooned for? 11? Was it
11?

01:00:51.743 --> 01:00:52.642
MATT: 11.

01:00:52.642 --> 01:00:54.942
LAURA: Can we grab onto him for a reaction?

01:00:54.942 --> 01:01:00.530
MATT: Nope! Caleb stands there in the back,
looking, and all of a sudden (impacts) into his

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:05.725
chest. The thing pierces in the stomach area there
and then gets pulled out. You try to reach for

01:01:05.725 --> 01:01:14.968
him, but he's already gone and he gets pulled out
in the middle of the open area. From there, comes

01:01:14.968 --> 01:01:16.577
the shallow priest's turn.

01:01:16.577 --> 01:01:18.401
LAURA: Oh no!

01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:22.033
SAM: The shallow priest?

01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:24.070
MARISHA: We fought one of those last time.

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:24.754
SAM: We did?

01:01:24.754 --> 01:01:25.315
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:26.661
LIAM: It lightninged us.

01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:28.095
TALIESIN: It went great.

01:01:28.095 --> 01:01:29.153
MARISHA: Yes, we did.

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:33.487
LAURA: What's its weakness, Beau?

01:01:33.487 --> 01:01:34.887
MARISHA: I'm looking.

01:01:34.887 --> 01:01:43.908
MATT: The shallow priest is going to move down and
it's going to move to there. It's going to attempt

01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:49.925
to harpoon Caleb out of the other one's grasp as
well. It's trying to chain pull you away. That's

01:01:49.925 --> 01:01:52.747
going to be a 17 to hit.

01:01:52.747 --> 01:01:53.920
LIAM: Shield.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:02.259
MATT: The harpoon ricochets off of the Shield and
goes limp. The creature pulls on the chain as it

01:02:02.259 --> 01:02:06.664
falls back into its grasp. It's currently
clutching its staff in the other hand and it's

01:02:06.664 --> 01:02:14.626
going to pull back for the rest of its movement
there out of the vicinity. That's going to end

01:02:14.626 --> 01:02:16.960
their turn. Now it comes to Nott.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:29.945
SAM: (screams) Seeing my friend pulled away, I will swim
reluctantly forward, stagger near him, and say

01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:46.155
to the creature that's captured him: Hey, fuckey!
What do you give a merrow who sings poorly? Auto-tuna!

01:02:46.155 --> 01:02:48.526
(groaning)

01:02:48.526 --> 01:02:50.664
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:02:50.664 --> 01:02:54.733
SAM: (laughing) I'm drunk, motherfucker!

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:59.121
LIAM: I've abandoned my son!

01:02:59.121 --> 01:03:03.124
TRAVIS: The last syllable delivered that one.

01:03:03.124 --> 01:03:05.742
SAM: I will cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter.

01:03:05.742 --> 01:03:08.533
MATT: Oh, gotcha! It's a wisdom saving throw?

01:03:08.533 --> 01:03:11.505
SAM: Wisdom, yes. 14. Not a high mark.

01:03:11.505 --> 01:03:18.485
MATT: The one that currently has Caleb. That is
going to be a 12. Success!

01:03:18.485 --> 01:03:27.007
SAM: So do they let go? It says they fall prone,
which they can't do underwater, but they are

01:03:27.007 --> 01:03:30.753
incapacitated, it says. So do they let go?

01:03:30.753 --> 01:03:36.796
MATT: The harpoon that pulled Caleb in has been
pulled out of the wound and there's a little bit

01:03:36.796 --> 01:03:41.107
of blood that's now trailing from the initial
impact. Caleb is not currently held or grappled.

01:03:41.107 --> 01:03:42.807
It's just not in his face.

01:03:42.807 --> 01:03:44.367
SAM: Oh, he's not impaled or anything?

01:03:44.367 --> 01:03:47.043
MATT: Not at this moment. When it pulled him in,
it pulled it out of his body, but it's right in

01:03:47.043 --> 01:03:48.102
front of him.

01:03:48.102 --> 01:03:53.067
SAM: Then I will use the rest, if I have any
remaining movement, to grab him by his scarf and

01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:54.627
pull him back away.

01:03:54.627 --> 01:03:59.392
MATT: You can't quite get up to him,
unfortunately. Because it's 15 feet underwater.

01:03:59.392 --> 01:04:05.136
Your speed of 30 is reduced to 15, and it took
15 feet to get far out. You could, as a bonus

01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:08.769
action, dash to move up to him, but you can't pull
him back because you don't have an action to try

01:04:08.769 --> 01:04:09.518
and grab.

01:04:09.518 --> 01:04:21.445
SAM: Got it. Ooh, tough. I will bonus action dash
and try to push him away. Push Caleb to the right or

01:04:21.445 --> 01:04:23.334
left out of the way.

01:04:23.334 --> 01:04:24.980
MATT: I'll say make a strength check.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:29.732
SAM: Okay. Nope. Oh wait, this is at disadvantage.

01:04:30.314 --> 01:04:31.064
MATT: Yes.

01:04:31.064 --> 01:04:36.230
SAM: Even worse! One. I'll save you!

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:47.403
MATT: You feel this small push on your shoulder and
you see Nott drift upside down in front of you. As

01:04:47.403 --> 01:04:57.460
the merrow who pulled you in with this terrible,
toothy grimace and starts going (chuckling) and is

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:05.059
bowling over, chuckling. It's a weird moment. That
finishes Nott's go. Caleb, you're up.

01:05:05.059 --> 01:05:07.240
LIAM: So those two are incapacitated in this
second, right?

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.612
MATT: That one is incapacitated.

01:05:08.612 --> 01:05:10.098
LIAM: The one on top is not?

01:05:10.098 --> 01:05:12.436
MATT: No, he's just held in place.

01:05:12.436 --> 01:05:23.973
LIAM: Okay. Well then, I will cast Slow on the
shallow priest and the one that's laughing in front

01:05:23.973 --> 01:05:25.974
of me as well as I back away.

01:05:25.974 --> 01:05:27.735
MATT: All righty.

01:05:27.735 --> 01:05:30.144
TALIESIN: What does Slow give them?

01:05:30.144 --> 01:05:31.687
LIAM: Slowness.

01:05:31.687 --> 01:05:33.858
TRAVIS: Half their speed and--

01:05:33.858 --> 01:05:39.175
LIAM: Hurts their AC. It's a wisdom saving of 16.

01:05:39.175 --> 01:05:49.895
MATT: Concentrating, both of you guys. Wisdom
saving throw. That's a failure on the shallow

01:05:49.895 --> 01:05:55.726
priest and the one that's over there rolled an 18.
So that's incapacitated is fine with the Slow;

01:05:55.726 --> 01:05:57.799
however, the shallow priest is slowed.

01:05:57.799 --> 01:06:02.200
LIAM: So shallow priest's AC is down by two,
disadvantage on dex saves, and he can only do an

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.336
action or a bonus, not both.

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:09.752
MATT: Correct. If it tries to cast a spell, it
takes a full round back before it can even hit.

01:06:09.752 --> 01:06:20.822
LIAM: I back away half my speed towards where
everybody is in the boat. I move behind my goblin Freund.

01:06:21.639 --> 01:06:25.719
MATT: You just manage to get back inside of the
chamber. The doorway's still open. All right, that

01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:28.067
finishes your go. Caduceus, you're up.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:29.543
TRAVIS: Come on, Cad!

01:06:29.543 --> 01:06:34.861
TALIESIN: Am I going to double this up? How are
you feeling?

01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:41.229
LIAM: (gurgling) Okay. Pretty good.

01:06:41.229 --> 01:06:46.129
TALIESIN: Pretty good? I'm going to use a bonus
action-- I can do two first level spells in a

01:06:46.129 --> 01:06:48.508
round, right? If one's bonus action, one is an
action, that's fine?

01:06:48.508 --> 01:06:49.318
MATT: Nope.

01:06:49.318 --> 01:06:50.681
TALIESIN: Just one or the other?

01:06:50.681 --> 01:06:52.601
MATT: One has to be cantrip and the other can be
any level.

01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:57.911
TALIESIN: Cantrip, there we go. Thank you. I'm
going to scoot past you with half of my action, if

01:06:57.911 --> 01:07:03.594
that's okay, and take a look outside to see what's
up. How far away--

01:07:03.594 --> 01:07:06.718
MATT: You have five more of feet in movement
there, stepping out of the doorway.

01:07:06.718 --> 01:07:18.765
TALIESIN: I have five feet no matter what? Okay.
Goddamn. There's no getting back in anyway, so

01:07:18.765 --> 01:07:26.207
fuck it. Yeah, there's no sense trying to get back
inside. I'm just going to be vulnerable. How far

01:07:26.207 --> 01:07:30.175
away is that one? Is that more than 30 feet away?

01:07:30.175 --> 01:07:31.516
MATT: Yeah.

01:07:31.516 --> 01:07:35.201
TALIESIN: There's no way I can get close enough to
get within 30 feet right now, is there?

01:07:35.201 --> 01:07:39.568
MATT: You can move five more feet, you might. You
have to eyeball it and may take the risk.

01:07:39.568 --> 01:07:46.392
TALIESIN: You know what? It's not like distance is
a problem here. I'll go in an angle and de-clump--

01:07:46.392 --> 01:07:47.622
yeah, right there.

01:07:47.622 --> 01:07:52.473
MATT: (counting) I'll say with the angle, 30, he's
just within range.

01:07:52.473 --> 01:07:55.480
TALIESIN: I think all three of those are within 30
feet then, at this point. I think that's pretty

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.538
fair. I'm casting Bane on all three of them.

01:07:57.538 --> 01:08:00.469
(oohing)

01:08:00.469 --> 01:08:02.098
TRAVIS: Fucking Caduceus!

01:08:02.098 --> 01:08:05.171
TALIESIN: That's a charisma save against 16.

01:08:05.171 --> 01:08:08.673
MARISHA: There's no way these fuckers are
charismatic.

01:08:08.673 --> 01:08:15.362
MATT: Nope! That's a fail. One in the middle,
that's a ten, that's a fail. Over here, that's a

01:08:15.362 --> 01:08:17.953
five. That's a fail. They all have a minus one on
their charisma.

01:08:17.953 --> 01:08:29.620
TALIESIN: They all take a negative d4 from an
attack or saving throws. All three of them.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.591
MATT: Not bad for a 1st-level spell. It doesn't
get a lot of love.

01:08:31.591 --> 01:08:33.733
TALIESIN: It's not a bad 1st-level spell.

01:08:33.733 --> 01:08:41.518
MATT: The water around seems to get even darker
for a moment and ice crystals begin to form at the

01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:46.159
edge of their bodies as the chill becomes
unnatural and begins sluggishly shift their

01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:51.819
movements, this cleric spell sending itself into
their form. That finishes your turn?

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.753
TALIESIN: That's everything I can do.

01:08:53.753 --> 01:08:56.887
MATT: Finishing that up, we can do the top of the
round. Yasha's up first.

01:08:56.887 --> 01:09:02.392
TRAVIS: She's going to take two reckless attacks
at this one that is near her for just a straight roll.

01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:11.786
MATT: Go for it. Yasha, by the way, is no longer
raging. She wasn't attacked or didn't-- Oh no, but

01:09:11.786 --> 01:09:16.030
she did get an attack of opportunity, so she would
be. You're correct.

01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:17.645
TRAVIS: So 20 on the first one.

01:09:17.645 --> 01:09:18.471
MATT: That hits.

01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:20.330
TRAVIS: The second is a 24.

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:21.962
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:29.272
TRAVIS: The first one (counting). Damn it. Seven
plus three is ten. And the second one--

01:09:29.272 --> 01:09:36.935
MATT: First blow, as she swings by, carves through
as it goes taut for a second, all of its muscle

01:09:36.935 --> 01:09:41.003
seizing, and then goes limp as its torso begins to
drift away from the lower half of its fish body

01:09:41.003 --> 01:09:43.828
and it begins to slowly float off.

01:09:43.828 --> 01:09:50.123
TRAVIS: Great. Shit. So if I didn't need that
second attack, did I waste it on the one that was there?

01:09:50.123 --> 01:09:53.716
MATT: Right now, you still have the second attack.
It depends on the movement you have and I don't

01:09:53.716 --> 01:09:55.923
what else you can get in range for.

01:09:55.923 --> 01:09:59.280
SAM: Just hit Beau! She's right there.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.613
MATT: Did you roll disadvantage on that attack, by
the way?

01:10:01.613 --> 01:10:06.612
TRAVIS: I made it reckless, so it was just a
straight roll. I'll use the 20 feet to head down

01:10:06.612 --> 01:10:09.577
towards the one that Caduceus is right in front
of.

01:10:09.577 --> 01:10:13.728
MATT: I would say that gets you right about there.
You'd be just in range for the one that's incapacitated.

01:10:13.728 --> 01:10:15.549
TRAVIS: Is that melee?

01:10:15.549 --> 01:10:16.431
MATT: Yeah.

01:10:16.431 --> 01:10:17.808
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah.

01:10:17.808 --> 01:10:20.132
MATT: It's just a-- down, it swims down.

01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:21.689
TRAVIS: I should have to roll, yeah?

01:10:21.689 --> 01:10:23.375
MATT: Yeah, reroll for this one.

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:24.081
TRAVIS: 17.

01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:25.434
MATT: 17 hits!

01:10:25.434 --> 01:10:31.246
TRAVIS: Okay, great. This does not have the extra
d6, so that's three plus six is nine, 12 points of

01:10:31.246 --> 01:10:32.690
slashing damage.

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:34.659
MATT: 12 points of slashing damage.

01:10:34.659 --> 01:10:36.924
LAURA: Is it hexed, did you hex it?

01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:39.217
MATT: Well, this is Yasha's turn.

01:10:39.217 --> 01:10:41.308
LAURA: Oh, this is Yasha.

01:10:41.308 --> 01:10:44.505
MATT: For your Tasha's Hideous Laughter, I believe
it gets to make a saving throw when it takes

01:10:44.505 --> 01:10:46.132
damage, is that correct?

01:10:46.132 --> 01:10:50.806
SAM: I will check. At the end of each turn and
each time it takes damage, the target can make

01:10:51.067 --> 01:10:52.937
another wisdom saving throw.

01:10:52.937 --> 01:10:54.338
MATT: That is a natural 18.

01:10:54.675 --> 01:10:56.650
TALIESIN: Wait, take negative d4 to that, too.

01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:57.836
MATT: That's right, yes.

01:10:57.836 --> 01:11:00.660
SAM: But the target has advantage on the saving
throw if it's triggered by damage.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.534
MATT: Okay, the advantage didn't help it.

01:11:03.534 --> 01:11:07.878
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, Matt. Will you add two points
of damage the last one that I just hit--

01:11:07.878 --> 01:11:09.382
MATT: Ooh, minus four brings it to 14.

01:11:09.382 --> 01:11:10.700
SAM: That's the spell--

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.610
MATT: So it still resists it.

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.241
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

01:11:14.241 --> 01:11:17.181
MATT: It reduced it to 14 but 14 was the DC.

01:11:17.181 --> 01:11:19.297
TALIESIN: Okay. Ah, well. But it's still got
Bane.

01:11:19.297 --> 01:11:20.894
LAURA: That was still really cool.

01:11:20.894 --> 01:11:23.240
TRAVIS: Will you add two points of damage to him
for rage damage, because I didn't add that.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.413
LAURA: You've got Bane.

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.020
TALIESIN: You got Baned.

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.449
MATT: All right.

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.025
TALIESIN: Bane's pretty cool.

01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:32.098
MATT: That finishes that go. All righty, Yasha's
turn's done. Beau and Jester.

01:11:32.499 --> 01:11:38.189
MARISHA: (heavy breathing) I'm swimming to that
guy. I'm going to Step of the Wind. Can I make it?

01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:39.373
MATT: You don't need to, you can get there--

01:11:39.373 --> 01:11:40.424
MARISHA: No, that guy.

01:11:40.424 --> 01:11:41.753
MATT: Oh, I see.

01:11:41.753 --> 01:11:43.244
MARISHA: Can I make it if I Step of the Wind?

01:11:43.244 --> 01:11:45.996
LAURA: Wait, before you do it I'm going to Guiding
Bolt him, so you get advantage.

01:11:45.996 --> 01:11:47.345
MARISHA: Oh, are you?

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.162
MATT: You would have to Step of the Wind to get to
him.

01:11:49.162 --> 01:11:51.287
MARISHA: Okay, and then I'll let Jester go first.

01:11:51.287 --> 01:11:53.193
LAURA: I'm going to step out and Guiding Bolt him,
that was my plan.

01:11:53.193 --> 01:11:55.960
MATT: Okay, go ahead and attempt that.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.506
MARISHA: So as she's swimming--

01:11:57.506 --> 01:11:59.817
LAURA: That definitely hits. That's 15 plus
seven.

01:11:59.817 --> 01:12:01.348
MATT: Yeah, no, that hits.

01:12:01.733 --> 01:12:03.063
(splat noise)

01:12:06.598 --> 01:12:09.076
TALIESIN: Hey! Eh.

01:12:09.076 --> 01:12:11.146
SAM: Terrible, just terrible.

01:12:11.146 --> 01:12:12.127
LAURA: 12.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:15.357
MATT: 12 points of damage to the shallow priest,
you got it.

01:12:15.357 --> 01:12:17.279
LAURA: Then you get advantage!

01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:23.046
MATT: With that, you move forward, swimming
through the water, and then Step of the Wind, use

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:27.403
another ki point to get up there, fists at the
ready.

01:12:27.403 --> 01:12:28.888
LIAM: Negative two to his AC.

01:12:28.888 --> 01:12:33.097
MARISHA: Okay, that is a 22.

01:12:33.097 --> 01:12:34.161
MATT: 22 hits.

01:12:34.161 --> 01:12:39.752
MARISHA: Not too bad, nine. Nein!

01:12:39.752 --> 01:12:42.262
MATT: Nine points of damage on that one.

01:12:42.262 --> 01:12:45.244
MARISHA: Second roll does not have advantage,
correct? It has disadvantage?

01:12:45.244 --> 01:12:49.298
MATT: Well, that first one should have been just a
regular roll. Did you roll with advantage?

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.500
MARISHA: I did.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.135
MATT: Just roll once for the first attack for me
again real fast.

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:58.533
MARISHA: I mean, it's the exact same thing. It's
still 22.

01:12:58.533 --> 01:13:01.019
MATT: There you go. For the second attack, it's
disadvantage.

01:13:01.019 --> 01:13:05.215
MARISHA: Okay. Don't fuck me, Gil. 17?

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:06.390
MATT: 17 still hits!

01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:10.567
MARISHA: Hey, Gil! Nine.

01:13:10.567 --> 01:13:16.149
MATT: There you go, nine and nine! You swim
forward, rocketing forward, Aquaman-style, and

01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:24.498
then two big hits to its face. The shallow priest
takes the impact, but its body reacts slowly. The

01:13:24.498 --> 01:13:30.477
spell that's surrounding it is forcing it to move
and shift at half the pace it normally would.

01:13:30.477 --> 01:13:35.246
MARISHA: I just slow-mo go--

01:13:35.246 --> 01:13:38.213
LAURA: From behind Beau, off in the distance, I,
at the same time--

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:44.670
MATT: Like rack focuses, from Beau's middle finger
to Jester's middle finger. Perfect, all right.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.792
That finishes Beau's go. Fjord, you're up.

01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:53.538
TRAVIS: Yes, I will come out of the quarters to
move within melee of the one that everybody's

01:13:53.538 --> 01:13:55.637
having the party around?

01:13:55.637 --> 01:13:58.451
TALIESIN: You may not be able to get to him.

01:13:58.451 --> 01:14:01.620
MATT: Oh no, you can because you don't have to
worry about it.

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:06.454
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have 30 feet. I'll take two swipes
with my falchion at disadvantage.

01:14:06.454 --> 01:14:07.303
MATT: Correct.

01:14:07.303 --> 01:14:11.155
TRAVIS: They're both 15, so that's a 23 to hit.

01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:12.365
MATT: That hits.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:19.527
TRAVIS: That's seven points of slashing damage,
and the second one is only an 11.

01:14:19.527 --> 01:14:21.057
MATT: 11 to hit?

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:21.902
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:14:21.902 --> 01:14:29.043
MATT: That misses, unfortunately. As the first one
carves through, the bloody cloud that's forming

01:14:29.043 --> 01:14:33.090
from the wounds it's sustaining gets thicker and
bigger. It's looking pretty hurt.

01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:33.966
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:14:33.966 --> 01:14:35.311
MATT: That finishes your turn?

01:14:35.311 --> 01:14:35.846
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:51.966
MATT: Now it's their turn. All right. The shallow
priest, who is currently slowed, is going to use

01:14:51.966 --> 01:14:55.869
its action to do its multiattack, so that's two
attacks on you with its bite and claw. It's not

01:14:55.869 --> 01:14:57.906
going to use any of its spells.

01:14:57.906 --> 01:14:59.853
LIAM: Does it get a multiattack, or does it just
get one attack?

01:14:59.853 --> 01:15:02.089
MATT: No, that's right. It doesn't get multiattack
when it's slowed.

01:15:02.089 --> 01:15:03.015
LIAM: It's a single attack.

01:15:03.015 --> 01:15:06.052
MATT: Then it's going to harpoon you. It's not
going to bother with the claw and the bite. It's

01:15:06.052 --> 01:15:10.247
going to pull back with its one harpoon and try
and thrust it into your chest.

01:15:10.247 --> 01:15:11.496
MARISHA: Wait, to me?

01:15:11.496 --> 01:15:12.073
MATT: Yes.

01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:13.192
TALIESIN: With a negative d4.

01:15:13.192 --> 01:15:14.709
LAURA: Negative d4.

01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:19.895
MATT: Correct. That's two off of it; that brings
it from 19 to 17. What's your armor class?

01:15:19.895 --> 01:15:20.715
MARISHA: 19!

01:15:20.715 --> 01:15:28.401
MATT: The Bane prevents it from hitting you. As it
goes and thrusts the harpoon forward, it

01:15:28.401 --> 01:15:34.304
telegraphs it just enough that, as it leaves, you
(whoosh). It nicks the very edge of your skin,

01:15:34.304 --> 01:15:36.372
ever so slightly, and that's it.

01:15:36.372 --> 01:15:39.814
MARISHA: I'm like: That's going to get infected
now, in the ocean.

01:15:39.814 --> 01:15:44.423
TRAVIS: It's the salt water. It'll be white around
the edges and really sting.

01:15:44.423 --> 01:15:46.531
MATT: It's going to attempt to move away.

01:15:46.531 --> 01:15:48.168
SAM: It's moving away! Get it!

01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:50.674
LAURA: Oh no, it's moving away! Sentinel.

01:15:50.674 --> 01:15:53.302
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

01:15:53.302 --> 01:15:54.619
MARISHA: Disadvantage, right?

01:15:54.619 --> 01:15:55.213
MATT: Yep.

01:15:55.213 --> 01:15:58.669
MARISHA: It's not good. No, I rolled a two and a
one.

01:15:58.669 --> 01:16:01.441
LIAM: Its speed is halved.

01:16:01.441 --> 01:16:08.225
MATT: Correct. It would have a swim speed of 40
underwater, so it can only go 20. It manages to

01:16:08.225 --> 01:16:11.706
pull out of the range up there, and at the end of
its turn, it gets to--

01:16:11.706 --> 01:16:12.774
LIAM: Make a save.

01:16:12.774 --> 01:16:15.103
MATT: Both of them make a save because they're
both-- well, that one, no. That one missed the

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:19.990
Slow. That is a 11 plus three, 14.

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:21.800
TALIESIN: Minus four. Or minus a d4.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:28.028
MATT: Minus four, ten. Yeah, it's still slowed.

01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:29.486
TALIESIN: Don't you fuck around with me.

01:16:29.486 --> 01:16:35.713
MATT: It's starting to turn around, too, seeing
how things shifted here. It saw the light, and you

01:16:35.713 --> 01:16:40.935
can see what little bit of his expression
underwater at this point. They followed this light

01:16:40.935 --> 01:16:47.070
to inspect it, thought they had an ambush on a
creature, and suddenly this party emerged. Now,

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:51.441
well, that one's in a really rough spot. This one
is looking like it's about to turn and try and flee.

01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:59.625
That's going to end the shallow priest's turn and
the other one's turn. I haven't done that one yet,

01:16:59.625 --> 01:17:05.008
right? That one is going to attempt to use its
harpoon against you, Fjord.

01:17:05.008 --> 01:17:05.741
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:17:05.741 --> 01:17:12.393
MATT: Since you ran up and carved at it. Or, yeah,
it's going to try that. That's a natural 20.

01:17:13.084 --> 01:17:17.658
TALIESIN: Minus-- well, it doesn't matter because
it can still only bring it down to 18, right?

01:17:17.658 --> 01:17:19.489
MATT: It's just not a critical hit.

01:17:19.489 --> 01:17:20.664
TALIESIN: What?

01:17:20.664 --> 01:17:22.029
MATT: Your ability, you're talking about?

01:17:22.029 --> 01:17:25.601
TALIESIN: No, I'm saying that with the d4, it
wouldn't bring that attack down at all, would it,

01:17:25.601 --> 01:17:27.128
enough to be managed?

01:17:27.128 --> 01:17:37.013
MATT: It would still be a critical hit for a
natural 20, but it would then be a total of-- it

01:17:37.013 --> 01:17:38.316
would be a 22 still.

01:17:38.316 --> 01:17:40.016
TALIESIN: Well, I'm canceling the critical,
anyway.

01:17:40.016 --> 01:17:44.938
MATT: You use Channel Divinity once to cancel the
critical on that. As the harpoon comes towards

01:17:44.938 --> 01:17:52.889
you, there's this slight, dull green barrier that
seems to slow the penetration of the immediate

01:17:52.889 --> 01:17:57.659
lightning-fast pace of this harpoon. It manages to
carve into the front of your armor and pierce

01:17:57.659 --> 01:18:01.922
through ever so slightly. It's not a critical hit,
unfortunately.

01:18:01.922 --> 01:18:02.726
TALIESIN: Nope.

01:18:02.726 --> 01:18:11.708
MATT: That's 11 points of piercing damage to you.
After it carves through and wounds you, it pushes

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:15.992
through the other way, and you manage to roll off.
It would've been far worse damage if Caduceus

01:18:15.992 --> 01:18:21.978
hadn't helped you in that moment. It's going to
attempt to move away. Yasha gets attack of opportunity.

01:18:21.978 --> 01:18:25.160
TRAVIS: Yes, she does. Reckless for a straight
roll.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.144
MATT: Right, because it is now reckless.

01:18:27.144 --> 01:18:33.228
TRAVIS: This is her only reaction. Oh, that's a 20
million. 25.

01:18:33.228 --> 01:18:34.373
MATT: That'll hit.

01:18:34.373 --> 01:18:36.014
SAM: I don't get an attack?

01:18:36.014 --> 01:18:39.492
MATT: No, because you were pushing him. You
weren't moving in that area, so you're not quite

01:18:39.492 --> 01:18:40.553
in melee with him.

01:18:40.553 --> 01:18:46.715
TRAVIS: 11 plus three is 14. 14 points of slashing
damage.

01:18:46.715 --> 01:18:50.826
MATT: 14 points of damage. It turns around and
darts, and Yasha just (whoosh), one swipe with her

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:56.924
sword. She's finishing them off left and right.

01:18:56.924 --> 01:18:59.440
LAURA: Yasha is such a badass.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.338
MATT: Ashley, come back!

01:19:01.338 --> 01:19:04.680
MARISHA and LAURA: Ashley, come back!

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.600
TRAVIS: Or take your time! Barbarians are dope,
yo.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.855
MATT: That finishes the merrow's turn. It did not
go well for them in that brief instance. Nott,

01:19:11.855 --> 01:19:13.332
you're up.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.647
SAM: Am I allowed to use my crossbow?

01:19:15.647 --> 01:19:17.530
MATT: Yeah. Your crossbow actually--

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:19.582
TRAVIS: Doesn't have any damage to it, yeah.

01:19:19.582 --> 01:19:21.155
LAURA: That's what I said.

01:19:21.155 --> 01:19:22.562
TRAVIS: You drunk fucker.

01:19:22.562 --> 01:19:28.232
SAM: I don't know what you people mean. How far is
they from me?

01:19:28.232 --> 01:19:33.009
MATT: They're probably about 40 or so feet from
you.

01:19:33.009 --> 01:19:38.219
SAM: I guess I'll doggy paddle up ten feet.

01:19:38.219 --> 01:19:39.904
TRAVIS: Like a turtle.

01:19:39.904 --> 01:19:49.530
SAM: I'll sea turtle up to them, ten, 15 feet, so
I'm within 30 feet, and then I will fire my

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:54.006
crossbow. It's at disadvantage because it's in the
water?

01:19:54.006 --> 01:20:00.310
MATT: Actually, crossbow does not get hit with
that problem because they're piercing. However,

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:04.334
what's your inside range? It's 30 feet?

01:20:04.334 --> 01:20:05.196
SAM: 30 feet.

01:20:05.196 --> 01:20:09.563
MATT: Then yeah, as long as you're inside range,
then you're fine. You swim up there towards it, as

01:20:09.563 --> 01:20:14.483
you're kicking your feet and cocking the bolt back
into it, and go to aim, just within range. You see

01:20:14.483 --> 01:20:17.902
it as it's turning around to attempt to swim away
at full speed.

01:20:17.902 --> 01:20:19.437
SAM: Did it just take its turn?

01:20:19.437 --> 01:20:20.183
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:22.814
SAM: I'm going to hold my action.

01:20:22.814 --> 01:20:24.005
LAURA: What? Why?

01:20:24.005 --> 01:20:25.467
LIAM: Let him! Let her.

01:20:25.467 --> 01:20:27.305
SAM: I mean, no one's near it.

01:20:27.305 --> 01:20:29.501
LAURA: Yeah, we're trying not to let it get away.

01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:31.638
SAM: No, I know, but aren't you going to go up
there?

01:20:31.638 --> 01:20:34.555
LAURA: Nobody will be able to get up there.

01:20:34.555 --> 01:20:36.593
TRAVIS: I mean, I could, but I don't want to.

01:20:36.593 --> 01:20:38.725
TALIESIN: We don't want them reporting back to
people.

01:20:38.725 --> 01:20:41.831
LAURA: I guess, if it just took its turn, then
there will be Yasha--

01:20:41.831 --> 01:20:46.033
SAM: There's a whole round. I guess I'm going to
shoot, not knowing what everyone else is doing.

01:20:46.033 --> 01:20:47.936
I'm drunk. I'm going to shoot.

01:20:47.936 --> 01:20:49.804
TRAVIS: There's not a lot of people that can get
over there.

01:20:50.199 --> 01:20:51.899
SAM: It's going to be 24 to hit.

01:20:51.899 --> 01:20:52.685
MATT: That hits.

01:20:52.685 --> 01:20:54.615
SAM: 27 to hit, or something like that.

01:20:54.615 --> 01:20:55.370
TALIESIN: 27?

01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:59.969
SAM: It's a lot, but it's only 1d6. Oh hey, it's a
six.

01:20:59.969 --> 01:21:02.458
LAURA: Plus?

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.937
SAM: Plus five. So 11.

01:21:04.937 --> 01:21:11.412
MATT: 11 points of piercing damage to the shallow
priest. You see another plume of dark ichor

01:21:11.412 --> 01:21:15.558
pouring out the side of its wound, as the bolt is
now about three or four inches jutting out of the

01:21:15.558 --> 01:21:21.516
side of its torso. It glances sidelong at you and
seems to inspire it to try and move faster. That

01:21:21.516 --> 01:21:22.602
finishes your turn, Nott?

01:21:22.602 --> 01:21:24.306
SAM: Bonus action, shoot again.

01:21:24.306 --> 01:21:26.463
MARISHA: Kill it.

01:21:26.463 --> 01:21:28.181
SAM: Oh, that's a three.

01:21:28.181 --> 01:21:31.701
MATT: Not so much on that one, unfortunately.

01:21:31.701 --> 01:21:34.062
SAM: I can reload!

01:21:34.062 --> 01:21:36.791
MATT: Finishing that go, Caleb, your turn.

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:44.460
LIAM: From where I'm standing, I see Nott firing
drunkenly up at an angle. I'm going to move

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:50.054
forward, and peek up in the direction that she is
looking, and see the shallow king, and say: Fick

01:21:50.054 --> 01:21:52.938
das!. I will cast Magic Missile at level three.

01:21:52.938 --> 01:21:54.016
MARISHA: Fick dish?

01:21:54.016 --> 01:21:55.230
SAM: It's fish dick.

01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:57.312
LIAM: No, it's fick das.

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.965
TRAVIS: Not anymore. Fish dick.

01:21:59.965 --> 01:22:01.057
MARISHA: Fish dick.

01:22:01.057 --> 01:22:02.563
LAURA: (whispers) Fish dicks.

01:22:02.563 --> 01:22:09.324
SAM: I'd love a nice fish dick right now with some
tartar sauce.

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:13.292
TRAVIS: I could eat the shit out of those.

01:22:13.292 --> 01:22:17.626
LIAM: A total of 19.

01:22:17.626 --> 01:22:22.193
MATT: 19 damage. All right, how do you want to do
this?

01:22:22.193 --> 01:22:24.164
TRAVIS: Oh, you got him!

01:22:24.164 --> 01:22:25.787
LAURA: You killed it?

01:22:25.787 --> 01:22:34.893
LIAM: The five of the Magic Missiles will spiral
around Fish Dick's head and come in at a different

01:22:34.893 --> 01:22:37.292
angle, and five of them go (impacts).

01:22:37.292 --> 01:22:43.288
MATT: Okay. It gets some distance. Caleb, feeling
comfortable, lets the missiles arc past and up and

01:22:43.288 --> 01:22:49.841
over as they swirl and gather. They all come in at
once, and this darkened shape, suddenly there's a

01:22:49.841 --> 01:22:57.317
flash of arcane energy and this strange little
bubble explosion where it was. The impact happens,

01:22:57.317 --> 01:23:03.949
and its arms separate from the impact. They hit in
the torso, blew it apart from the inside. There's

01:23:03.949 --> 01:23:08.392
a little cloud of darkness left behind as it
begins to slowly disseminate among the rest of the

01:23:08.392 --> 01:23:10.230
sea water around.

01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:12.891
LIAM: I will step back in five feet.

01:23:12.891 --> 01:23:17.499
TRAVIS: Check their corpses. See if they have
anything on them that can tell where they came from.

01:23:18.205 --> 01:23:20.051
SAM: They came from the ocean, Fjord.

01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:24.334
TRAVIS: Nott, really, we've got to get over this
fear, man. We got a job to do.

01:23:24.334 --> 01:23:27.538
SAM: No, they're from the ocean. Where else would
they be from?

01:23:27.538 --> 01:23:30.548
TRAVIS: But where in the ocean, where?

01:23:30.548 --> 01:23:32.622
SAM: Isn't all the ocean the same?

01:23:32.622 --> 01:23:33.209
TRAVIS: No.

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:39.012
MARISHA: This one's the Great Barrier Reef. I
don't know.

01:23:42.482 --> 01:23:46.713
MATT: Here in the shadowed darkness.

01:23:46.713 --> 01:23:48.908
LAURA: Can we search the bodies?

01:23:48.908 --> 01:23:50.323
SAM: I'll search the bodies.

01:23:50.323 --> 01:23:52.058
MARISHA: We search the limbs.

01:23:52.058 --> 01:23:59.461
MATT: On the two regular merrow that you
came across, you find that they have their

01:23:59.488 --> 01:24:05.593
harpoon. There are definitely teeth upon their
bodies, and claws, as part of their physical form.

01:24:05.593 --> 01:24:12.500
They're not carrying much on them, per se, beyond
the equipment they have and a handful of collected

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:24.626
shiny things. A few copper. A key that was
scrounged up that's old and very rusted. Looks

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:25.619
like maybe a handful of--

01:24:25.619 --> 01:24:26.907
MARISHA: Zelda has taught us we want the key.

01:24:26.907 --> 01:24:29.165
MATT: All right, you have a rusted key.

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:32.668
TRAVIS: Don't do it like that. You know that
shit's important.

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:33.790
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:38.456
TALIESIN: 11 months from now: Do you have the
rusty key?

01:24:38.456 --> 01:24:42.581
TRAVIS: If only we could close the barrier to
the--

01:24:42.581 --> 01:24:51.644
MATT: The shallow priest, since it was destroyed a
ways off, some of its accoutrements were left to

01:24:51.644 --> 01:25:00.043
scatter and float below. You do manage to find, on
what pieces you do scrounge up, a heavy necklace

01:25:00.043 --> 01:25:07.471
made of these larger pearls, probably worth a
little bit of gold on the side. That's about it.

01:25:07.471 --> 01:25:12.451
LAURA: Can I hold up one of the fish claws and see
if it matches the claws that are on the box?

01:25:12.451 --> 01:25:13.598
MATT: Okay.

01:25:13.598 --> 01:25:15.725
SAM: I'm going to take the pearl necklace.

01:25:15.725 --> 01:25:22.413
MATT: All right, write that down. Inspecting where
the hands meet with the box, no. These are a

01:25:22.413 --> 01:25:23.691
different size--

01:25:23.691 --> 01:25:28.470
LAURA: You guys, it's not the same fish claws!
It's something bigger that had the box.

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:29.764
SAM: Oh, fuck you.

01:25:29.764 --> 01:25:31.789
MATT: Slightly larger. At least, it seems--

01:25:31.789 --> 01:25:34.200
SAM: I'm out of here, guys. It's been real.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:41.255
TRAVIS: Wait, Nott! We're about to cross the area
of the button graveyard that lies beneath the waves.

01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:47.000
SAM: Can you hear yourself right now? You sound
pathetic. Pathetic!

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.613
TRAVIS: I'm just looking out for you, Nott. I
don't want you to--

01:25:49.613 --> 01:25:55.528
SAM: I understand when I'm being condescended to,
even when I'm drunk!

01:25:55.528 --> 01:26:03.191
LIAM: All right, let's treat this situation with
the seriousness it demands. I douse the lights and

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:09.268
bring Frumpkin down onto my own head like a mask,
so I can see through Frumpkin vision.

01:26:09.268 --> 01:26:13.330
MATT: All right, so you have a--

01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:19.074
LIAM: Like a Zorro mask with Frumpkin's beak right
there.

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:27.592
MATT: You see these two dark octopus eyes and then
this little, unshaven grin poking through underneath.

01:26:27.619 --> 01:26:30.977
LIAM: Little Zemnian man who's like: Can't believe
I didn't think of this sooner!

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:38.243
TRAVIS: Jester, I'm sure all that action probably
messed up your Locate? Or is it still up somehow?

01:26:38.243 --> 01:26:43.724
LAURA: It only lasts for ten minutes, so I mean,
we might be coming to the very end of it.

01:26:43.724 --> 01:26:47.327
MATT: I'd say you have a few more minutes on it
still because you didn't cast any other

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:50.274
concentration spells, and you didn't take any
damage, so you're fine.

01:26:50.274 --> 01:26:55.884
LAURA: It's over that way. It's still 700 to 800
feet.

01:26:55.884 --> 01:26:57.077
TRAVIS: Would you lead the way?

01:26:57.077 --> 01:26:57.612
LAURA: Me?

01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:58.180
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:58.949
LAURA: Sure.

01:26:58.949 --> 01:27:05.668
TALIESIN: How many people got hurt in that fight,
by the way? Three of us, I think, took damage?

01:27:05.668 --> 01:27:07.461
LIAM: No, ein bisschen.

01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:09.534
LAURA: You can't hear anything.

01:27:09.534 --> 01:27:15.317
TALIESIN: While we're walking, it's going to be
about a ten-minute walk? Is it insane to--?

01:27:15.317 --> 01:27:16.428
MATT: You don't know.

01:27:16.428 --> 01:27:22.876
TALIESIN: Yeah, as we're walking, I'm going to
start Prayer of Healing, I guess. I know it takes

01:27:22.876 --> 01:27:26.601
about ten minutes, but it's a one-spell heal-all.

01:27:26.601 --> 01:27:28.292
MATT: Okay, if you want to.

01:27:28.292 --> 01:27:38.845
TALIESIN: If that's okay. Everybody gets, oh! 17
points back.

01:27:38.845 --> 01:27:39.797
MARISHA: Whoa!

01:27:39.797 --> 01:27:45.176
MATT: We'll consider that as you guys are
traveling. You're helming this journey from that

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:47.046
direction? Make a perception check for me,
please.

01:27:47.046 --> 01:27:52.644
LAURA: Okay, yeah. 22.

01:27:52.644 --> 01:28:00.611
MATT: 22, that's great. As you guys step off of
the edge of your ship's wreckage, and all slowly

01:28:00.865 --> 01:28:07.619
sink down to find the floor of the ocean once more
and the subtle grade that continues downward. As

01:28:07.619 --> 01:28:12.820
you being to step, following Jester, moving
forward, you see another shape begin to approach.

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:16.299
Jester, you see it first and glance over. It's
another ship.

01:28:16.299 --> 01:28:20.065
TRAVIS: Under the water or on the surface?

01:28:20.065 --> 01:28:26.842
MATT: No, another ship, sunken, here. You continue
on for another 100 or 150 or so feet, and you see

01:28:26.842 --> 01:28:30.005
the shape off to the right of another shipwreck.

01:28:30.005 --> 01:28:31.983
LAURA: (whispering) It's a graveyard.

01:28:31.983 --> 01:28:38.890
TRAVIS: We're definitely in that shit now. The
song? Y'all remember the song?

01:28:38.890 --> 01:28:41.001
SAM and MARISHA: The Diver's Grave!

01:28:41.001 --> 01:28:45.334
SAM: Maybe we should go up for supplies.

01:28:45.334 --> 01:28:49.703
MATT: The spell fades, but you still know the
general direction of where it was coming from. Up

01:28:49.703 --> 01:28:53.232
to you if you want to cast it again or continue on
based on the memory.

01:28:53.232 --> 01:28:54.446
LAURA: Let's continue.

01:28:54.446 --> 01:28:57.828
MARISHA: Do I see any sources of light?

01:28:57.828 --> 01:28:59.309
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:28:59.309 --> 01:29:01.963
LAURA: Can we move stealthily underwater?

01:29:01.963 --> 01:29:07.062
MATT: You can certainly try. You're moving
half-speed because of the water, and you're moving

01:29:07.062 --> 01:29:13.066
at half speed beyond that, moving stealthily. So
it's a very slow journey, but you can do it.

01:29:13.066 --> 01:29:14.392
MARISHA: 11.

01:29:14.392 --> 01:29:17.878
MATT: Okay. Are you guys moving stealthily or
not?

01:29:17.878 --> 01:29:19.104
MARISHA and LIAM: Yes.

01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:21.780
LAURA: It'll be a slow journey, but we can try to
move.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:26.306
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check, and make a
stealth check for Yasha as well. You guys are

01:29:26.306 --> 01:29:29.687
moving at quarter speed, essentially, to move
underwater.

01:29:29.687 --> 01:29:32.827
TALIESIN and LAURA: Six.

01:29:32.827 --> 01:29:35.805
SAM and LIAM: 19.

01:29:35.805 --> 01:29:37.076
MARISHA: 25.

01:29:37.076 --> 01:29:39.463
TRAVIS: 18. Six.

01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:44.478
LAURA: Oh no, we're so evil! But the average--

01:29:44.478 --> 01:29:53.650
MATT: The average is slightly in your favor.
You're on the edge there. Continuing forward, it

01:29:53.650 --> 01:30:01.394
evens out a bit, this gradual, caldera-type valley
that rests here before you. The more you begin to

01:30:01.394 --> 01:30:07.484
watch, now that you're keeping an eye for it,
there's a number of areas where wreckage can be

01:30:07.484 --> 01:30:12.515
seen, some of it very old. The third ship that you
pass by, heading in the direction that you recall,

01:30:12.515 --> 01:30:15.515
has been down here for decades.

01:30:15.515 --> 01:30:26.346
MARISHA: Why here though? Why all these shipwrecks
here? Especially if Sabian planted a bomb on your

01:30:26.564 --> 01:30:30.781
ship, that's not because of natural causes; is
there something about this area that freaks people

01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:32.136
out or something?

01:30:32.136 --> 01:30:37.675
TRAVIS: I mean, it's always rough waters and the
storms are frequent. You normally make it through

01:30:37.675 --> 01:30:41.646
with good prep, but I didn't know it was like
this.

01:30:41.646 --> 01:30:52.575
MARISHA: Do we feel anything? Does it feel weird,
like any type of, I don't know, energy? Something?

01:30:52.575 --> 01:30:54.696
Caduceus, I look at Caduceus.

01:30:54.696 --> 01:30:57.952
MATT: Make a general wisdom check.

01:30:57.952 --> 01:30:59.135
TRAVIS: Her?

01:30:59.135 --> 01:31:05.894
MATT: Yeah, since she's attempting to get in tune
with the energy of the atmosphere.

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:14.402
MARISHA: The roll reflects the vaguety of my
question. Vaguety. With a big old seven.

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:21.021
MATT: You concentrate for a moment, and the water
gets slightly warmer.

01:31:21.021 --> 01:31:24.796
LAURA: Ooh, I feel better.

01:31:24.796 --> 01:31:27.046
MARISHA: Ugh!

01:31:27.046 --> 01:31:31.892
MATT: You decide to maybe not walk directly behind
Jester.

01:31:31.892 --> 01:31:33.867
TRAVIS: It's all sterile, it's fine.

01:31:33.867 --> 01:31:43.057
MATT: With the little bit of travel you're doing--
they're sparse, but there are a number of ships in

01:31:43.057 --> 01:31:47.135
this large area that seem to have sunken at
different times throughout the years.

01:31:47.135 --> 01:31:48.797
MARISHA: I didn't see any source of light?

01:31:48.797 --> 01:31:53.432
MATT: No source of light, no. Jester, however,
who's been at the front keeping a close eye-- a

01:31:53.432 --> 01:31:59.192
little ways in as you're peering out and clocking
in each of these shipwrecks as they come across,

01:31:59.192 --> 01:32:04.406
you see this little, faint blip of light.

01:32:04.406 --> 01:32:07.088
LAURA: Is it moving or is it a blip or a what?

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:14.624
MATT: You see it once or twice again. It's a
little momentary shine.

01:32:14.624 --> 01:32:18.360
LAURA: There's like, a light. Yeah.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.100
SAM: Over at the Frankenstein house?

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:23.805
TALIESIN: I was waiting for it.

01:32:23.805 --> 01:32:28.288
LAURA: I mean, it's in front of us, yeah? About
how far away is it?

01:32:28.288 --> 01:32:32.668
MATT: At this point of travel, it's about 350, 400
feet ahead of you.

01:32:32.668 --> 01:32:35.484
LAURA: Is it around where the orb feels like it
is?

01:32:35.484 --> 01:32:37.267
MATT: The general direction.

01:32:37.267 --> 01:32:39.786
TRAVIS: We need to take a short rest.

01:32:39.786 --> 01:32:42.344
TALIESIN: I mean, I don't think that's--

01:32:42.344 --> 01:32:43.755
LAURA: I won't get any use out of it.

01:32:43.755 --> 01:32:45.092
LIAM: I would.

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:51.760
LAURA: 30 minutes; we want to sit here in the
open, in the graveyard for an hour?

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:56.685
TRAVIS: We keep going, but I think we remember
from the song that that could be the lantern

01:32:56.685 --> 01:32:57.745
light, right?

01:32:57.745 --> 01:32:59.813
TALIESIN: Regardless, I'm blind regardless.

01:32:59.813 --> 01:33:02.866
TRAVIS: Maybe we should fan out a bit.

01:33:02.866 --> 01:33:05.761
LIAM: Maybe bioluminescent, just like an
underwater creature.

01:33:05.761 --> 01:33:07.754
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a firing line.

01:33:07.754 --> 01:33:10.567
SAM: Should I go up and prep the boat?

01:33:10.567 --> 01:33:17.115
TRAVIS: No, Nott, I need you here. Maybe give
ourselves ten feet of distance between each other

01:33:17.115 --> 01:33:18.745
and fan out.

01:33:18.745 --> 01:33:24.733
LAURA: Just think about how much damage you did
when you were barely even trying.

01:33:24.733 --> 01:33:27.322
SAM: It's all over me!

01:33:27.322 --> 01:33:30.129
TALIESIN: I can't see so I'll stick with
somebody.

01:33:30.129 --> 01:33:31.967
LAURA: You can stick with me.

01:33:31.967 --> 01:33:33.940
TRAVIS: No, the clerics are not sticking
together.

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:34.887
LAURA: What?

01:33:34.887 --> 01:33:37.214
TRAVIS: The clerics do not stay together anymore.

01:33:37.214 --> 01:33:40.540
SAM: Yasha and Beau stay together, the clerics
stay together.

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.763
MARISHA: Birds of a feather.

01:33:42.763 --> 01:33:44.867
TALIESIN: I'll stick with Yasha.

01:33:44.867 --> 01:33:47.022
LIAM: I'll be with Nott.

01:33:47.022 --> 01:33:51.587
TRAVIS: We'll fan out in a wide line as we
approach instead of as a group.

01:33:51.587 --> 01:33:54.500
MATT: All right. If I could get a marching order,
please.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:34:01.728
LAURA: Oh, this is like when we first started and
we were in a line. You guys remember, and we were

01:34:01.728 --> 01:34:03.206
looking for that witch?

01:34:03.206 --> 01:34:05.237
MARISHA: Yeah. Now we're doing it again.

01:34:05.237 --> 01:34:06.841
MATT: Who's together and what?

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:08.302
TRAVIS: Am I with you, Jester?

01:34:08.302 --> 01:34:08.954
LAURA: Sure.

01:34:08.954 --> 01:34:13.668
TALIESIN: Yasha and Clay, and everyone else is
singling or--?

01:34:13.668 --> 01:34:15.701
LIAM: Caleb and Nott are together.

01:34:15.701 --> 01:34:19.055
LAURA: Then Beau, Jester and Fjord in the
middle-ish.

01:34:19.055 --> 01:34:22.345
LIAM: It is like the beginning of the campaign.

01:34:22.345 --> 01:34:23.433
LAURA: Yeah.

01:34:23.433 --> 01:34:24.966
SAM: And it will be the end.

01:34:24.966 --> 01:34:28.438
(laughter)

01:34:28.438 --> 01:34:37.212
MATT: What a nice book end! You all begin to
slowly move forward, keeping your eyes peeled for

01:34:37.212 --> 01:34:44.250
any sort of movement with no light. It is
extremely dark here with that faint little bit of

01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:46.853
shimmering dull green from above.

01:34:46.853 --> 01:34:53.593
LAURA: I should be on the other side of Fjord, so
I'm closer to Caleb.

01:34:53.593 --> 01:35:02.264
MATT: There you go. As you guys continue to move
in that direction, some of you begin to see this

01:35:02.264 --> 01:35:12.775
light as well. Caduceus first, then you, Caleb,
and Beau. You see it looks like-- imagine if beams

01:35:12.775 --> 01:35:27.370
of sunlight managed to roll across a piece of
polished metal, a little shining, shifting sight.

01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:29.995
TRAVIS: If she's a big-ass anglerfish I'm going to
be so pissed.

01:35:29.995 --> 01:35:35.603
MARISHA: Yeah, nope! I don't want to be eaten. Oh,
god.

01:35:35.603 --> 01:35:38.426
LAURA: That's definitely a glimmer pot.

01:35:38.426 --> 01:35:39.943
MARISHA: Glimmer pot?

01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:42.473
SAM: It was in the song.

01:35:42.473 --> 01:35:52.159
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah, because it talks about enticing
people with their lantern light-- treasure.

01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:55.142
Treasure in their eyes.

01:35:55.142 --> 01:36:00.724
LAURA: Are we going to just walk straight towards
it then or maybe--?

01:36:00.724 --> 01:36:02.246
MARISHA: Well, she has the eye.

01:36:02.246 --> 01:36:05.021
TALIESIN: I think the notion is that you're not
supposed to look directly in it, some sort of

01:36:05.021 --> 01:36:06.203
thing maybe.

01:36:06.203 --> 01:36:07.849
LAURA: Oh. Don't look at the light?

01:36:07.849 --> 01:36:11.110
TALIESIN: Don't look at whatever the eye or light
or thing-- I don't know.

01:36:11.110 --> 01:36:16.296
TRAVIS: Hey. One of us has a familiar that can
look for us, right?

01:36:16.296 --> 01:36:17.183
LAURA: Good call.

01:36:17.183 --> 01:36:17.711
LIAM: Yeah.

01:36:17.711 --> 01:36:21.870
LAURA: Caleb, send Frumpkin up and see what the
lantern light is.

01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:30.331
LIAM: Okay, so I can do that. I will send Frumpkin
low along the bottom in the direction of this

01:36:30.331 --> 01:36:31.401
thing, stealthily.

01:36:31.401 --> 01:36:33.461
MATT: Are you guys staying put or are you
continuing to move forward slowly?

01:36:33.461 --> 01:36:36.350
LIAM: Ooh, let's take a looky-loo for the moment.

01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:44.224
MATT: You all sit tight for a second, halting your
position. You watch as the octopus makes its way

01:36:44.224 --> 01:36:50.046
into the shadow ahead. Caleb, you're focusing, and
it takes a while, but Frumpkin eventually,

01:36:50.046 --> 01:37:01.543
following this tiny, shifting bead of golden light
into view. You begin to see towards the center of

01:37:01.543 --> 01:37:11.213
where this large valley is. There is a large
cluster of long dead, pale-white coral that

01:37:11.213 --> 01:37:14.152
surrounds a rocky stone shelf.

01:37:14.152 --> 01:37:15.820
MARISHA: Too real.

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.942
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome.

01:37:17.942 --> 01:37:20.121
MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

01:37:20.121 --> 01:37:20.810
LAURA: Bones!

01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:33.100
MATT: Okay. You see this coral space around. It's
massive; it's maybe 250, 300 feet across, and it's

01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:40.658
this dead chunk of coral reef in this vicinity
that amassed around this central stone that rises

01:37:40.658 --> 01:37:46.243
up. There's a small crevasse on the side of it
that goes down about 30 or so feet and you can see

01:37:46.243 --> 01:37:48.174
fish weaving through.

01:37:48.174 --> 01:37:52.572
LIAM: But I did see where this flashing source
was?

01:37:52.572 --> 01:37:53.905
MATT: Yeah, but it's occasional.

01:37:53.905 --> 01:37:58.044
LIAM: Occasional, okay. So it's not like there was
a creature that Frumpkin and I were able to aim

01:37:58.044 --> 01:38:00.695
towards, it was just this thing that was appearing
and disappearing?

01:38:00.695 --> 01:38:04.945
MATT: Yeah, and maybe every now and then reorient
the direction that Frumpkin was traveling. As you

01:38:04.945 --> 01:38:09.141
come to see this space, does Frumpkin continue to
get closer?

01:38:09.141 --> 01:38:11.497
LIAM: Yeah.

01:38:11.497 --> 01:38:18.460
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin moves around and it takes a
while because Frumpkin isn't very good at

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.716
perceiving right now.

01:38:19.716 --> 01:38:21.291
TALIESIN: Thunk.

01:38:21.291 --> 01:38:25.805
MATT: You guys are getting a little impatient
here, hearing--

01:38:25.805 --> 01:38:28.816
TRAVIS: We're 300 feet away, right?

01:38:28.816 --> 01:38:29.747
MATT: Yeah.

01:38:29.747 --> 01:38:31.756
TRAVIS: Can we get within 100 feet?

01:38:31.756 --> 01:38:32.945
MATT: If you want to.

01:38:32.945 --> 01:38:33.639
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:38:33.639 --> 01:38:38.771
LAURA: Keep moving forward slowly. Nott? I'll hold
Caleb's hand on the other side.

01:38:38.771 --> 01:38:41.370
MATT: You all continue to move forward.

01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:42.704
TRAVIS: Cautiously.

01:38:42.704 --> 01:38:45.605
LIAM: So we're connecting those two groups?

01:38:45.605 --> 01:38:46.409
LAURA: Whatever.

01:38:46.409 --> 01:38:47.594
LIAM: We're spread out a little.

01:38:47.594 --> 01:38:48.385
LAURA: We're spread out.

01:38:48.385 --> 01:38:56.165
MATT: Frumpkin is going around and checking and
finds that towards the front of this coral reef

01:38:56.165 --> 01:39:02.750
area where this rock shelf is, there appears to be
an open cavern entrance right underneath this

01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:08.750
shelf. As Frumpkin ducks down and looks, you can
see another one of the shine; there's a few of them.

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.840
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:17.697
LIAM: Frumpkin will piss out some ink and use a
bonus action to dash back towards the group.

01:39:17.697 --> 01:39:23.389
MATT: Frumpkin quickly retracts and finds his way
to the rest of you.

01:39:23.389 --> 01:39:26.159
LAURA: What did you see?

01:39:26.159 --> 01:39:31.517
LIAM: I tell him to come back and come out and
say: There's a lot of things just ahead of us over

01:39:31.517 --> 01:39:33.046
the ridge.

01:39:33.046 --> 01:39:34.735
MARISHA: What do you mean, things?

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:37.900
LIAM: Flashing, moving things, things that are
alive.

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:38.943
MARISHA: Oh.

01:39:38.943 --> 01:39:40.918
LIAM: More than one, I think.

01:39:40.918 --> 01:39:42.097
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:39:42.097 --> 01:39:43.955
MARISHA: More than one?

01:39:43.955 --> 01:39:45.123
LIAM: I think so.

01:39:45.123 --> 01:39:46.582
MARISHA: That's still in the direction of the
orb?

01:39:46.582 --> 01:39:50.764
LIAM: Or something large with many parts, but I
could not tell too well.

01:39:50.764 --> 01:39:52.737
LAURA: What was the glimmer?

01:39:52.737 --> 01:39:55.787
LIAM: I could not tell you.

01:39:55.787 --> 01:39:58.623
LAURA: He didn't see a lot, did he?

01:39:58.623 --> 01:40:02.074
LIAM: No, it's murky down here.

01:40:02.074 --> 01:40:06.633
TRAVIS: Who wants to take a look?

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:09.477
SAM: Why don't you--?

01:40:09.477 --> 01:40:13.176
LAURA: Let's all just run forward and charge over
the ridge.

01:40:13.176 --> 01:40:18.105
SAM: How about this? Here's an idea. Go back to
the merrow that we killed, get one of their

01:40:18.105 --> 01:40:24.605
tridents or whatever, Disguise Self like you're
one of them, and then you can just swim in like

01:40:24.605 --> 01:40:27.516
you're a bad fish.

01:40:27.516 --> 01:40:30.320
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't think that's a--

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.558
LAURA: Is it going to work?

01:40:32.558 --> 01:40:33.341
TALIESIN: No.

01:40:33.341 --> 01:40:36.205
MARISHA: How do you know that the merrow are
friends with these people?

01:40:36.205 --> 01:40:37.795
SAM: They're not people.

01:40:37.795 --> 01:40:42.399
MARISHA: Well, this group of angry things that
might want to kill us.

01:40:42.399 --> 01:40:48.484
TALIESIN: I think they're going to be nervous that
Fjord doesn't speak the language and is moving at

01:40:48.484 --> 01:40:50.802
half-- plus he swims funny.

01:40:50.802 --> 01:40:53.440
LIAM: I am reaffixing Frumpkin to my face.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.316
MARISHA: He actually swims really well.

01:40:55.316 --> 01:40:56.920
TALIESIN: Not for a fish person, though.

01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:02.559
TRAVIS: Let's keep moving in, yes? There's nothing
gained by staying up here.

01:41:02.559 --> 01:41:04.508
LAURA: Let's keep on going.

01:41:04.508 --> 01:41:06.607
LIAM: But maybe--

01:41:06.607 --> 01:41:08.771
MARISHA: Someone say it.

01:41:08.771 --> 01:41:14.705
TRAVIS: As we approach this area that he's
described to us, this white coral, you said it was

01:41:14.705 --> 01:41:17.207
in a valley, like a dip?

01:41:17.207 --> 01:41:18.088
MATT: Yep.

01:41:18.088 --> 01:41:23.120
TRAVIS: At the top of where the valley is, is
there any cover that we might be able to get up

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.478
behind and then peek down into said valley, like
boulders?

01:41:26.478 --> 01:41:33.527
MATT: As you're moving through this area, there
are clumps of seaweed that rise up hundreds of

01:41:33.527 --> 01:41:38.493
feet out of view. The base of it is pretty thick
and you could try and move through that. That's

01:41:38.493 --> 01:41:43.326
what you are using to stealth as you come through,
darting from section to section of this heavy

01:41:43.326 --> 01:41:44.943
underwater vegetation.

01:41:44.943 --> 01:41:49.583
LAURA: Can we cut some of the seaweed and hold it
in front of us so that when we move it just looks

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:51.016
like seaweed?

01:41:51.016 --> 01:41:51.844
MATT: Sure.

01:41:51.844 --> 01:41:53.113
MARISHA: Kind of into it, actually.

01:41:53.113 --> 01:41:54.705
MATT, TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

01:41:54.705 --> 01:41:56.504
MARISHA: I'll jump on that train, yeah.

01:41:56.504 --> 01:41:59.711
MATT: That's going to itch like a motherfucker in
the morning.

01:41:59.711 --> 01:42:04.543
MARISHA: That's okay. We're at the bottom of the
ocean. A lot's going to itch.

01:42:04.787 --> 01:42:09.844
MATT: You slowly farm sections of seaweed and
begin to shift your way forward, using it as a

01:42:09.844 --> 01:42:18.362
screen. The shifting tendrils slowly shimmy along
in the direction of this coral cluster.

01:42:18.362 --> 01:42:19.793
MARISHA: Can we ribbon dance a little bit as we
go?

01:42:19.793 --> 01:42:21.204
MATT: There you go.

01:42:21.204 --> 01:42:25.373
LIAM: Just you two, right? Is this the group?

01:42:25.373 --> 01:42:30.229
LAURA: No, all of us are doing it. Whoever wants
to be stealthy and be a brilliant person, I guess.

01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:33.463
MARISHA: I just wrap some seaweed around Caleb.

01:42:33.463 --> 01:42:34.154
LIAM: Okay.

01:42:34.154 --> 01:42:38.577
MATT: Who's at the front of this journey?
Maintaining a similar position?

01:42:38.577 --> 01:42:39.808
TRAVIS: I will be.

01:42:39.808 --> 01:42:42.413
MATT: Okay. Perception check, and one other person
if they wish to.

01:42:42.413 --> 01:42:43.618
TALIESIN: I don't have--

01:42:43.618 --> 01:42:45.343
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, he doesn't have darkvision.

01:42:45.343 --> 01:42:46.749
LAURA: I mean, I can try--

01:42:46.749 --> 01:42:47.447
MARISHA: Sure.

01:42:47.447 --> 01:42:48.233
LAURA: Okay.

01:42:48.233 --> 01:42:49.774
MARISHA: Oh, go. Yeah, you're leading the pack.

01:42:49.774 --> 01:42:53.023
MATT: Both of you guys roll perception.

01:42:53.023 --> 01:42:54.443
LAURA and TRAVIS: 17.

01:42:54.443 --> 01:42:55.382
MATT: Okay.

01:42:55.382 --> 01:42:56.463
TALIESIN: There you go.

01:42:56.463 --> 01:43:02.660
MATT: As you both come up to the edge of where the
sandbank here seems to slightly descend in a

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:08.787
series of soft steps before that small ravine
carves down and that large chunk of rock stands

01:43:08.787 --> 01:43:14.649
there, you can see the cavern. You see once again
that shifting. It's like a wave of light passes

01:43:14.649 --> 01:43:21.913
over. You can see it's coins. A bunch of light
passes over coins that are scattered amongst the

01:43:21.913 --> 01:43:24.065
floor of the entrance of this tunnel.

01:43:24.065 --> 01:43:26.471
TRAVIS: Oh, there's an entrance to the tunnel,
okay.

01:43:26.471 --> 01:43:28.554
LAURA: Can we see what made the light?

01:43:28.554 --> 01:43:30.428
MATT: Not from this distance.

01:43:30.428 --> 01:43:31.329
SAM: Coins.

01:43:31.329 --> 01:43:33.097
MARISHA: This is it.

01:43:33.097 --> 01:43:36.055
LIAM: So the ground is littered with coins outside
of this?

01:43:36.055 --> 01:43:41.159
MATT: You saw at the entrance a handful of coins
that caught the light, yeah.

01:43:41.159 --> 01:43:42.679
SAM: Is Buttonbeard is real?

01:43:42.679 --> 01:43:45.096
TRAVIS: Nott, did you think I was lying?

01:43:45.096 --> 01:43:47.465
SAM: I thought it was just a legend.

01:43:47.465 --> 01:43:51.542
TRAVIS: I'm hurt. Our friendship has taken damage
from this exchange.

01:43:51.542 --> 01:43:52.931
SAM: He's real?

01:43:52.931 --> 01:43:59.162
TRAVIS: Like Santa Claus, you might have to go up
and check for yourself. Tug on the beard, see if--

01:43:59.563 --> 01:44:01.577
MARISHA and TALIESIN: This is a terrible idea.

01:44:01.577 --> 01:44:02.773
TRAVIS: But do it by yourself.

01:44:02.773 --> 01:44:04.391
MARISHA: This is literally exactly--

01:44:04.391 --> 01:44:05.374
LAURA: Don't do that.

01:44:05.374 --> 01:44:06.240
SAM: I could go.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.935
LAURA: She's drunk, don't tell her to do stupid
things.

01:44:07.935 --> 01:44:09.253
SAM: I could go over and just take a look.

01:44:09.253 --> 01:44:11.023
MARISHA: Nope. That's how people die.

01:44:11.023 --> 01:44:12.994
TRAVIS: How much do you love buttons?

01:44:12.994 --> 01:44:17.406
MARISHA: Fjord. Remember when I said I would check
you when you're being a dick?

01:44:17.406 --> 01:44:17.995
SAM: No.

01:44:17.995 --> 01:44:21.533
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I do. Yeah. All right. Fine. We
do it together.

01:44:21.533 --> 01:44:24.028
MARISHA: Okay. I don't think we should go in this
way.

01:44:24.028 --> 01:44:26.222
TALIESIN: I don't think we should go in this way
either.

01:44:26.222 --> 01:44:27.538
TRAVIS: I'm open to suggestions.

01:44:27.538 --> 01:44:32.378
MARISHA: It literally says, "Treasure is in their
eyes. They swim for treasure in the lantern

01:44:32.378 --> 01:44:37.423
"light." This is a pot. This is a honeypot for
sure.

01:44:37.423 --> 01:44:41.868
LAURA: Can we swim around and look for another
entrance to this cavern?

01:44:41.868 --> 01:44:46.089
TRAVIS: Don't one of y'all have a copy of
yourselves that you could send in a certain distance?

01:44:46.723 --> 01:44:50.059
LAURA: I mean I can only get it 120 feet away from
me.

01:44:50.059 --> 01:44:57.324
LIAM: It will also put it at alert even before we
get there. You send it in and it sees this other

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.531
Jester and then it is ready for a fight.

01:44:59.531 --> 01:45:06.605
SAM: I could send an image of a fish or something
in there and see what happens, or some other type

01:45:06.605 --> 01:45:07.790
of creature.

01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:12.154
TRAVIS: I mean, if it's a trap that can be sprung
by something going in, maybe fish or maybe a

01:45:12.154 --> 01:45:14.668
humanoid, that would probably be good.

01:45:14.668 --> 01:45:17.572
LAURA: No, we don't want it to know we're here.

01:45:17.572 --> 01:45:22.138
TRAVIS: Well, they're going to know really quick,
right? We're not going to make it in silently,

01:45:22.138 --> 01:45:27.965
right? I mean, this is clearly a honeypot, it's a
trap. Might as well spring the trap.

01:45:30.875 --> 01:45:32.339
LIAM: Well--

01:45:32.339 --> 01:45:39.352
MARISHA: I mean, we could send in an image of a
fish and see, but an image of a fish-- it's not

01:45:39.352 --> 01:45:41.255
movement of water, it's not the same.

01:45:41.255 --> 01:45:42.826
LIAM: We're on this ridge.

01:45:42.826 --> 01:45:47.533
MATT: You're maybe about, since you stopped at
that edge before it begins to descend over, you're

01:45:47.533 --> 01:45:49.356
about 60 or so feet from this.

01:45:49.356 --> 01:45:55.163
LIAM: What do we see to the sides and-- so there's
a cavern straight ahead facing towards us?

01:45:55.163 --> 01:45:59.576
MATT: Yeah. Ahead and facing towards you guys with
a large shelf that protrudes over it that puts it

01:45:59.576 --> 01:46:04.982
mostly in shadow, and the coral's built all around
that. If you wanted to try and move around it you

01:46:04.982 --> 01:46:08.252
could, but it's about 200 or so feet across.

01:46:08.252 --> 01:46:13.860
LIAM: That is my point. I think we quietly go
around and get on top of the house and throw

01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:18.267
whatever the bait is in front and then we're back
here for whatever comes out.

01:46:18.267 --> 01:46:19.496
SAM: He's very smart.

01:46:19.496 --> 01:46:20.947
TALIESIN: I think that's a very reasonable plan.

01:46:20.947 --> 01:46:22.400
TRAVIS: I agree. Let's do that.

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.376
LAURA: Then I can send Jester down there.

01:46:24.376 --> 01:46:25.594
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, let's do it.

01:46:25.594 --> 01:46:26.125
LAURA: Okay.

01:46:26.125 --> 01:46:26.977
TRAVIS: Make it so.

01:46:26.977 --> 01:46:30.846
MATT: You guys swim across towards the top? All
right. You paddle up as a group, up--

01:46:30.846 --> 01:46:32.434
TRAVIS and LAURA: Around.

01:46:32.434 --> 01:46:33.462
MATT: Oh, around?

01:46:33.462 --> 01:46:34.559
MARISHA: Around, not over top.

01:46:34.559 --> 01:46:35.354
LIAM: Take our time.

01:46:35.354 --> 01:46:39.984
MATT: You guys move slowly around, still moving
stealthily, to the edges. Then you move up and

01:46:39.984 --> 01:46:41.651
over? What are you doing?

01:46:41.651 --> 01:46:42.205
SAM: Yes.

01:46:42.205 --> 01:46:43.305
MATT: Okay.

01:46:43.305 --> 01:46:45.027
TRAVIS: Around the sides of the map instead of
just across.

01:46:45.027 --> 01:46:46.109
LIAM: Sitting on top of it.

01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:50.242
MATT: You get up and slowly descend towards where
the coral is. Your feet find the edges. Some of it

01:46:50.242 --> 01:46:55.354
is brittle and as your foot touches, it snaps and
parts of it crumble at the very edges, but nothing

01:46:55.354 --> 01:47:00.210
that you feel will alert your presence
necessarily.

01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:02.617
TRAVIS: Conserve the reef you guys, be responsible
divers.

01:47:03.129 --> 01:47:06.798
MARISHA: It's so sad. Don't drop anchors. Anyway,
continue.

01:47:06.798 --> 01:47:12.830
MATT: As you move up to the edge of the shelf, and
you glance over the edge, you see the shadow

01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:23.247
entrance of the cavern before you. Once again that
shimmer finds its way across a dozen or more coins

01:47:23.247 --> 01:47:30.684
that are visible, partially embedded in the muck
and sand there at the foot of this cavern entrance.

01:47:30.726 --> 01:47:34.300
LAURA: Should I try to send my duplicate down?

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:38.536
TALIESIN: One question. This is definitely coral
that we are sitting on top of, right?

01:47:38.897 --> 01:47:46.883
MATT: It's bits of coral. When you step out
towards that shelf, the coral recedes and now it's

01:47:46.883 --> 01:47:50.866
a protruding large slab of stone.

01:47:50.866 --> 01:47:55.561
TALIESIN: It is a protruding large slab of stone
and not a big-ass mouth or anything like that, right?

01:47:55.561 --> 01:47:57.699
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:47:57.699 --> 01:47:58.989
TRAVIS: Oh, come on.

01:47:58.989 --> 01:48:02.114
MARISHA: It's always a big-ass mouth.

01:48:02.114 --> 01:48:07.095
TALIESIN: I'm looking at it. (raspberry) 11.

01:48:07.095 --> 01:48:10.579
LIAM: You just turned 12 years old.

01:48:10.579 --> 01:48:12.559
TALIESIN: It's been a day.

01:48:12.559 --> 01:48:18.369
MATT: It looks to be stone.

01:48:18.369 --> 01:48:26.755
TALIESIN: (exaggerated sighing) I'm putting
tinfoil on my windows now, I'm fucking done.

01:48:26.755 --> 01:48:28.451
LIAM: Yes, DM.

01:48:28.451 --> 01:48:30.905
TALIESIN: Yes, DM. I think we send Jester.

01:48:30.905 --> 01:48:33.611
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to create my duplicate.

01:48:33.611 --> 01:48:37.493
MATT: Okay. So you use Channel Divinity once and
you send your duplicate to swim down--

01:48:37.493 --> 01:48:41.823
LAURA: I'm going to swim down and I'm going to
have her skip around and see the coins and be

01:48:41.823 --> 01:48:47.727
like-- and go over and act like she's going to try
to get the coins.

01:48:47.727 --> 01:48:57.650
MATT: Okay. You watch as the illusory Jester goes
and performs a great stock video of excited lucky

01:48:57.650 --> 01:49:01.943
person, performing the reaction silently.

01:49:01.943 --> 01:49:05.507
TRAVIS: Can it please be the infomercials where
she has trouble collecting the coins?

01:49:05.507 --> 01:49:06.978
MATT: Have you ever--?

01:49:06.978 --> 01:49:07.810
MARISHA: Oh no!

01:49:07.810 --> 01:49:11.154
MATT: Don't you hate it when--?

01:49:11.154 --> 01:49:15.368
TRAVIS: I can't hold shit.

01:49:15.368 --> 01:49:21.449
MATT: 30 seconds pass of Jester doing the song and
dance down there. No reaction.

01:49:21.449 --> 01:49:24.779
LAURA: Shit. It might need actual vibrations or--

01:49:24.779 --> 01:49:27.312
TRAVIS: No, there's nothing down there. I'll jump
down there and join Jester.

01:49:27.312 --> 01:49:32.998
MATT: Okay. Fjord dives off the side and swims
down towards the entrance to this cavern. As you

01:49:32.998 --> 01:49:37.523
approach you can see the coins plainly in front of
you. Do you land at the entrance?

01:49:37.523 --> 01:49:38.441
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:49:38.441 --> 01:49:45.558
MATT: Okay. Your feet find soft footfall on the
sediment that has gathered there, knocking up a

01:49:45.558 --> 01:49:48.960
little bit of it for a minute before it all
eventually settles once more. Looking inside, make

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.661
a perception check.

01:49:50.661 --> 01:49:53.547
TRAVIS: Really good on these today. Three.

01:49:53.547 --> 01:49:54.410
MATT: Okay.

01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:56.917
LIAM: Shitty rolls at this table.

01:49:56.917 --> 01:50:04.568
MATT: You glance inside; there's no source of the
light that you keep seeing flashing by. You look

01:50:04.568 --> 01:50:10.196
down and there's no glittering anymore. There's no
traveling light beam, but the coins are there in

01:50:10.196 --> 01:50:15.195
front of you. Looking up into the cavern, it
continues in and seems to descend and open up into

01:50:15.195 --> 01:50:19.342
a chamber just where your darkvision ends.

01:50:19.342 --> 01:50:20.402
TRAVIS: Looks fine.

01:50:20.402 --> 01:50:28.394
MATT: The inside is filled with seaweed as well.
It seems to be running up the walls of the

01:50:28.394 --> 01:50:34.455
interior, as well as a section of it sitting in
the center of the main chamber. It's a different

01:50:34.455 --> 01:50:37.005
color than the seaweed that you've been using to
get here.

01:50:37.005 --> 01:50:41.551
TRAVIS: I'll look up where everybody is and I'm
like--

01:50:41.551 --> 01:50:44.718
TALIESIN: I think maybe we just don't take the
coins, maybe.

01:50:44.718 --> 01:50:47.196
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe no one touches the treasure.

01:50:47.196 --> 01:50:48.891
SAM: (distressed noises)

01:50:48.891 --> 01:50:56.112
LAURA: Nott, don't. I'm going to hold onto Nott as
we jump down.

01:50:56.112 --> 01:51:00.006
MARISHA: Buttonbeard knows who touches his
treasure and who doesn't.

01:51:00.006 --> 01:51:01.747
SAM: Is that part of the legend?

01:51:01.747 --> 01:51:07.066
LAURA: Yeah. There's more treasure inside if you
make it past the initial treasure.

01:51:07.066 --> 01:51:08.325
SAM: I believe you.

01:51:08.325 --> 01:51:12.033
TRAVIS: I'm already down here, so I'll summon the
falchion.

01:51:12.033 --> 01:51:19.979
MATT: With a slight displacement and popping sound
of the water making room for the falchion as it

01:51:19.979 --> 01:51:25.456
emerges, it hums slightly in your grasp, being
this deep in the ocean.

01:51:25.456 --> 01:51:30.260
TRAVIS: I'll hold it up. Is the eye doing anything
other than casting that glowing light?

01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:39.081
MATT: No, but it is casting it and it is very
present. There is a faint hint of eagerness

01:51:39.081 --> 01:51:40.703
brimming from within you.

01:51:40.703 --> 01:51:45.269
TRAVIS: Y'all do something before I get reckless.

01:51:45.269 --> 01:51:46.375
MARISHA: Let's go.

01:51:46.375 --> 01:51:48.234
LAURA: We're heading down.

01:51:48.234 --> 01:51:52.473
MARiSHA: I'm going to swim and try not to touch
the ocean floor.

01:51:52.473 --> 01:51:57.191
MATT: Okay, so you stay up above. All of you make
your way towards the entrance to this cavern.

01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:01.324
LAURA: I'm going to send the duplicate out in
front of us; I've still got 30 seconds left of it.

01:52:01.324 --> 01:52:03.593
LIAM: I'm going to keep an eye on our rear.

01:52:03.593 --> 01:52:08.357
TALIESIN: The minute I hear things start, I'm
going to cast some light on the walls so I can see shit.

01:52:08.357 --> 01:52:13.598
MATT: All right, that will be Caleb at the back,
Jester and Fjord towards the front, everyone else

01:52:13.598 --> 01:52:14.921
staying in the center.

01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:18.313
SAM: Jester said she was holding me.

01:52:18.313 --> 01:52:19.656
LAURA: I am holding.

01:52:19.656 --> 01:52:29.075
MATT: That's right, so you will be up with Jester.
As you guys slowly begin to make your way into the tunnel--

01:52:29.779 --> 01:52:34.271
LAURA: I let go of Nott as soon as we're into the
tunnel, away from the coins.

01:52:34.271 --> 01:52:42.234
MATT: As you release Nott into the water, you guys
begin to take your first steps into the interior

01:52:42.234 --> 01:52:44.947
of the cavern. We're going to take a break.

01:52:44.947 --> 01:52:47.917
TRAVIS: I knew it was coming, it just--

01:52:47.917 --> 01:52:48.807
MARISHA: I know.

01:52:48.807 --> 01:52:50.646
TRAVIS: My back's sweating!

01:52:50.646 --> 01:52:56.407
MATT: We'll be back here in a minute to see what
this strange chamber seems to hold.

01:52:56.407 --> 01:53:03.667
MARISHA: I need to re-listen to the tale of
Dashilla. I need to go find that awesome ukulele

01:53:03.667 --> 01:53:04.883
version those girls did.

01:53:04.883 --> 01:53:07.033
TRAVIS: The light stopped doing this across the
gold, right?

01:53:07.033 --> 01:53:10.106
MATT: Yes, once you stood there, the gold was
seemingly inert.

01:53:10.106 --> 01:53:11.905
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:53:11.905 --> 01:53:22.403
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes. Before
we hop over, we do have the giveaway. Our fine

01:53:22.403 --> 01:53:27.744
friends at Wyrmwood are giving away this amazing
wenge dice vault. "Wenj"? How do you pronounce it?

01:53:28.659 --> 01:53:30.090
MARISHA: "When-gay."

01:53:30.090 --> 01:53:32.077
MATT: "When-gay," thank you. I always mess that
up, I don't know.

01:53:32.077 --> 01:53:33.920
MARISHA: We had this discussion today.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:40.289
MATT: This is awesome, two-tone on each side, dice
vault for giveaway. It is the wenge dice vault

01:53:40.289 --> 01:53:45.873
with tiger maple inlay, which is what this is
called-- looks awesome-- and a copy of your own

01:53:45.873 --> 01:53:48.160
Pumat t-shirt is in the giveaway as well!

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:49.879
TRAVIS: The one that you wore, Matt?

01:53:49.879 --> 01:53:53.061
MATT: I hope not, you don't want that. You really
don't want that. This will be given away to

01:53:53.061 --> 01:53:56.902
somebody at the end of the break. To enter, go
ahead and head over to the Critical Role Twitch

01:53:56.902 --> 01:54:04.060
chat at twitch.tv/criticalrole during the break
and enter the word intro. I-N-T-R-O. Enter it

01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:08.121
once; more than that, you'll be disqualified,
unfortunately, and once again this is only viable

01:54:08.121 --> 01:54:10.297
for people in the U.S. and Canada, excluding
Quebec.

01:54:10.297 --> 01:54:11.562
MARISHA: Sorry, Quebec.

01:54:11.562 --> 01:54:17.029
MATT: I know. We'll have a winner here in a few
minutes, so sit tight, we'll see you soon.

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:25.874
MATT: Well played, and welcome back everybody!
Before we get started, the winner of our fantastic

01:54:25.874 --> 01:54:30.016
giveaway with the Pumat shirt and this awesome
dice vault from our friends at Wyrmwood is

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:35.107
QuickAscension. QuickAscension, congratulations;
we'll get this out to you ASAP.

01:54:35.107 --> 01:54:36.594
SAM: QuickAscension!

01:54:36.594 --> 01:54:39.143
MATT: QuickAscen-- no.

01:54:39.143 --> 01:54:41.322
SAM: We play D&amp;amp;D.

01:54:41.322 --> 01:54:43.808
TRAVIS and SAM: We play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons!

01:54:43.808 --> 01:54:45.953
LIAM: That's all the show is now. That's the rest
of the campaign.

01:54:45.953 --> 01:54:56.097
MATT: That will break me. As we left off, you all
were beginning to make your way into this series

01:54:56.097 --> 01:55:00.535
of-- there's this whole strange entrance to this
cavern.

01:55:00.535 --> 01:55:02.757
TRAVIS: It's just a cave, you guys.

01:55:02.757 --> 01:55:16.085
MATT: As you step in the inside, it descends a
bit, like makeshift natural paths, like stairs or

01:55:16.285 --> 01:55:22.021
grades that curve around and drop into the central
chamber where you see it goes in two different

01:55:22.021 --> 01:55:30.014
directions, to the right and left. In the middle,
there's a large cluster of this purplish-maroon

01:55:30.014 --> 01:55:37.277
seaweed. The outside of the leaves have a
teal-ish blue color. It wraps up against the walls

01:55:37.277 --> 01:55:44.098
as well. As you swim through and move, the still
water shifts with your movement; you can see some

01:55:44.098 --> 01:55:46.414
of it sway and move with your movement.

01:55:46.414 --> 01:55:50.940
TRAVIS: Oh fucking Jesus, our stealth is going to
be balls here. What does the floor look like?

01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.920
Sand, silt, coins?

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:55.307
MATT: Looking down, make an investigation check.

01:55:55.307 --> 01:55:57.420
TRAVIS: Can't you just tell me?

01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.155
MARISHA: Jesus, Travis!

01:56:00.155 --> 01:56:01.442
TRAVIS: Yeah, nine.

01:56:01.442 --> 01:56:02.892
LIAM: The hell is wrong with us tonight?

01:56:02.892 --> 01:56:04.100
MARISHA: What's wrong with you?

01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:05.688
TRAVIS: I used it up last week!

01:56:05.688 --> 01:56:07.521
MATT: Apparently. Well, if there was a week to use
it.

01:56:07.521 --> 01:56:08.530
TRAVIS: That's true.

01:56:08.530 --> 01:56:14.445
MATT: You sift your hand through underneath and
feel. You find an errant copper piece left there

01:56:14.588 --> 01:56:22.829
that comes up into your fingers. The rest of it
appears to be general sand and soft silt that

01:56:22.829 --> 01:56:28.112
clouds a bit around your fingers as you pull your
hand up from mucking around in it. It settles

01:56:28.112 --> 01:56:29.265
fairly quickly.

01:56:29.265 --> 01:56:33.504
TRAVIS: Do you want to keep your duplicate in
front of us, or is it gone?

01:56:33.504 --> 01:56:38.095
LAURA: It only lasts for a minute, but yes, I can
keep her there as long as she lasts.

01:56:38.095 --> 01:56:39.504
MATT: Right about now, she vanishes.

01:56:39.504 --> 01:56:40.330
LAURA: She's gone.

01:56:40.330 --> 01:56:43.252
TALIESIN: We're in the room?

01:56:43.252 --> 01:56:43.872
MATT: Yes.

01:56:43.872 --> 01:56:51.482
TALIESIN: I may be blind, other than what I can
see, but if I hit Detect Magic, something's going

01:56:51.482 --> 01:56:53.416
to light up in my--

01:56:53.416 --> 01:56:56.251
MATT: It's certainly possible.

01:56:56.251 --> 01:57:02.140
TALIESIN: All right. I'm just saying, if there was
something, I feel like I would know that.

01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:05.649
SAM: I could make an image of something ahead of
us.

01:57:05.649 --> 01:57:10.316
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Detect Magic? Why'd I
put a question mark at the end of that?

01:57:10.316 --> 01:57:12.828
MARISHA: Detect Magic?

01:57:12.828 --> 01:57:15.637
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Detect Magic really
quickly.

01:57:15.637 --> 01:57:26.526
MATT: Okay. Nothing ahead of you seems to give a
magical aura; behind you, ever so faintly.

01:57:26.526 --> 01:57:30.972
TALIESIN: The magical aura's coming from the mouth
of the cave?

01:57:30.972 --> 01:57:33.640
MATT: It's coming from the mouth of the cave,
towards the top.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:36.441
TRAVIS: Towards the top?

01:57:36.441 --> 01:57:42.664
TALIESIN: Oh! It's where the light's being
projected from, I imagine. But nothing in the room?

01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:50.321
MATT: Nothing in the room-- and you do know,
glancing at that magical aura coming from the

01:57:50.321 --> 01:57:54.585
entranceway, it is illusory in nature.

01:57:54.585 --> 01:58:03.053
TALIESIN: I would also be able to sense something
magic through it that's buried up to three feet down.

01:58:03.053 --> 01:58:03.987
MATT: Correct.

01:58:03.987 --> 01:58:07.266
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm not getting any other pings in
here?

01:58:07.266 --> 01:58:08.393
MATT: Nope.

01:58:08.393 --> 01:58:11.889
TALIESIN: Just that weird thing up front, nothing
else.

01:58:11.889 --> 01:58:23.612
SAM: I will cast Silent Image and project a small
dwarf man, about 60 feet in front of us, with a

01:58:23.612 --> 01:58:34.632
beard made out of buttons and a pirate hat cocked
to one side, and he's walking all prim and proper,

01:58:34.632 --> 01:58:42.627
like he owns the place. He's got a patch on his
eye that's made out of a button!

01:58:42.627 --> 01:58:47.493
(laughter)

01:58:47.493 --> 01:58:56.757
MATT: Old Buttonbeard's legend lives on! As
Buttonbeard trounces around the central chamber,

01:58:56.757 --> 01:59:00.224
no reaction.

01:59:00.224 --> 01:59:11.806
TALIESIN: I'm going to ask the kelp: Hey guys,
this feels a little ominous. You'd let me know if

01:59:11.806 --> 01:59:16.165
there was something untoward happening around
here, right? Right?

01:59:16.165 --> 01:59:22.353
MATT: You express your interests to the kelp.
Well, seaweed, technically. Kelp is a little more

01:59:22.353 --> 01:59:23.846
shallow-based, yeah.

01:59:23.846 --> 01:59:25.852
TALIESIN: Thank you, that is fair.

01:59:25.852 --> 01:59:27.896
LIAM: What on earth are we doing?

01:59:27.896 --> 01:59:29.808
TRAVIS: Just hold on, octopus-head.

01:59:29.808 --> 01:59:31.503
MARISHA: Apparently, kelp is shallow.

01:59:31.503 --> 01:59:35.244
SAM: You're wearing an octopus, he's talking to
seaweed, there's a Buttonbeard in front of us.

01:59:35.244 --> 01:59:36.780
This is totally normal.

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:38.770
LIAM: Mine is functional!

01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:42.605
MARISHA: (sings circus tune)

01:59:42.605 --> 01:59:47.981
MATT: You're all still standing in the entranceway
as you come down into this central chamber. It's

01:59:47.981 --> 01:59:52.361
about 35, 40 feet from side to side and then it
branches off to the right and left ahead of you--

01:59:52.361 --> 01:59:54.557
LAURA: Which way are we going?

01:59:54.557 --> 01:59:57.811
MATT: There is that central cluster of seaweed
that is coming up and going against the ceiling

01:59:57.811 --> 02:00:01.178
and you can see on the walls, it's still riding
along the edges.

02:00:01.178 --> 02:00:03.468
TRAVIS: We're going to the right.

02:00:03.468 --> 02:00:05.406
SAM and LAURA: Okay.

02:00:05.406 --> 02:00:10.655
TALIESIN: I'm proud of you for that. Hopefully
that'll be the first good roll you've made tonight.

02:00:11.939 --> 02:00:14.351
TRAVIS: Did you hear anything from your talk?

02:00:14.351 --> 02:00:20.845
TALIESIN: To be fair, they don't really talk back,
but sometimes they can acknowledge these things.

02:00:20.845 --> 02:00:22.740
Besides, it's polite.

02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:26.096
TRAVIS: Can we move towards the fork?

02:00:26.096 --> 02:00:32.689
MATT: You move towards the fork. The chamber
itself is oval-like, but in the center of the

02:00:32.689 --> 02:00:38.544
chamber is where there's a mass of the seaweed, so
you'd have to curve around it to get to either exit.

02:00:38.576 --> 02:00:42.804
LAURA: Are there any pebbles on the ground or
anything?

02:00:42.804 --> 02:00:47.052
MATT: There are some wayward stones that you could
probably--

02:00:47.052 --> 02:00:50.456
TRAVIS: This seaweed in the middle of the chamber,
have we seen anything like this before?

02:00:51.223 --> 02:00:53.780
MATT: No, all the seaweed in this chamber is a
different color than what you've seen when you

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:59.018
came in. Everything else had a greenish-blue tint
to it, this has a deep maroon-purple with a blue

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:03.583
outline across the exterior of each little thread
of leaf.

02:01:03.583 --> 02:01:08.894
TRAVIS: What was the color of the fruit in the
fucking temple? Weren't they like--?

02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:10.237
MARISHA: I think so.

02:01:10.237 --> 02:01:13.394
LAURA: I think they were yellow. I pictured them
like mangoes.

02:01:13.394 --> 02:01:15.253
MATT: Yeah, they were mango-esque.

02:01:15.253 --> 02:01:16.787
LAURA: They were mango-esque.

02:01:16.787 --> 02:01:20.873
TRAVIS: But the inside was purplish and red,
right? Well, because it was obviously being fed blood.

02:01:20.875 --> 02:01:22.280
LAURA: It was, it was bloody.

02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:24.091
TRAVIS: Sorry, trying to make a connection where
there might not be one.

02:01:24.091 --> 02:01:25.908
MARISHA: No, I was with you.

02:01:25.908 --> 02:01:27.072
TRAVIS: Yeah, no deal, okay.

02:01:27.072 --> 02:01:29.704
LAURA: Can I toss one of the pebbles at a cluster
of--?

02:01:29.704 --> 02:01:36.221
MATT: It hits it, moves with the impact with the
faint bit that gets hit. There's no reaction.

02:01:36.221 --> 02:01:41.441
TRAVIS: Did we want to separate and go around and
meet on the other side?

02:01:41.441 --> 02:01:47.229
LAURA: What if there's something in the middle of
the cluster? Can we use a stick or something? You

02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:49.198
want to use your staff and push the cluster?

02:01:49.198 --> 02:01:51.642
TALIESIN: I literally can't see anything right
now.

02:01:51.642 --> 02:01:55.887
LAURA: Oh, there's a cluster of kelp in the middle
of the room here.

02:01:55.887 --> 02:01:58.688
TALIESIN: Things tend to live.

02:01:58.688 --> 02:02:01.446
TRAVIS: Anybody have any objections to going to
the right?

02:02:01.446 --> 02:02:02.983
SAM: No, let's just do it.

02:02:02.983 --> 02:02:03.891
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

02:02:03.891 --> 02:02:07.206
SAM: Fuck it, right? We're all going to die down
here anyway, it doesn't matter.

02:02:07.206 --> 02:02:09.693
LAURA: Don't you think there might be something in
the middle of all the kelp though?

02:02:09.693 --> 02:02:12.993
TRAVIS: There might be, but we'll keep an eye on
it as we move around to the right; I just have a

02:02:12.993 --> 02:02:18.564
very strong feeling about going to the right. It's
based off of, really, gut-- I'm right handed, so

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:20.351
we're going to go to the right.

02:02:20.351 --> 02:02:21.264
SAM: Let's do it.

02:02:21.264 --> 02:02:23.348
MARISHA: All right.

02:02:23.348 --> 02:02:26.217
LAURA: Do we see bubbles in the water at all?

02:02:26.217 --> 02:02:28.206
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:02:28.206 --> 02:02:39.043
LAURA: Ten. No! That's a nine, so that is a 13.

02:02:39.043 --> 02:02:41.824
MATT: Oh, just you, okay.

02:02:41.824 --> 02:02:47.674
TALIESIN: I would ask permission before putting a
light in the kelp to see if there's anything in there.

02:02:48.252 --> 02:02:51.817
MATT: No bubbles. There's no aeration of the
interior here.

02:02:51.817 --> 02:02:55.055
TRAVIS: Can we see a top to this chamber?

02:02:55.055 --> 02:02:59.497
MATT: Glancing up, yeah, you can see where the
seaweed gathers and bunches up towards meeting it

02:02:59.497 --> 02:03:05.824
from the walls in the center of the chamber. It's
maybe 15 feet above you. It's not terribly tall.

02:03:05.824 --> 02:03:08.479
TALIESIN: When was the-- yeah, all right.

02:03:08.479 --> 02:03:15.415
TRAVIS: Okay, can we start moving to the right?
Will we be able to see a clear divide between the

02:03:15.415 --> 02:03:17.454
two left and right passages?

02:03:17.454 --> 02:03:19.937
MATT: You can see the two sides, yeah.

02:03:19.937 --> 02:03:26.265
TRAVIS: It's a divide that goes from ceiling to
floor, right? It's not some fucking uvula that's

02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:29.259
hanging right there, waiting to dangle?

02:03:29.259 --> 02:03:32.165
MATT: It looks like it's a cavern.

02:03:32.165 --> 02:03:35.671
TRAVIS: Okay. You know what I'm saying?

02:03:35.671 --> 02:03:37.033
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm with you.

02:03:37.033 --> 02:03:40.188
LIAM: I am not. What are we doing?

02:03:40.188 --> 02:03:42.057
SAM: We're going to the right.

02:03:42.057 --> 02:03:43.359
LIAM: Let's go to the right, then.

02:03:43.359 --> 02:03:45.957
TRAVIS: Hey Nott, stab the floor really fast.

02:03:45.957 --> 02:03:46.660
SAM: What?

02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:49.579
TRAVIS: Stab the floor with your dagger.

02:03:49.579 --> 02:03:51.743
SAM: Shortsword.

02:03:51.743 --> 02:03:59.981
MATT: Okay. It goes a few inches into the soft
floor of the chamber before it hits stone.

02:03:59.981 --> 02:04:03.129
SAM: It's been pacified.

02:04:03.129 --> 02:04:07.540
TRAVIS: Thank you. We'll continue to the right.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:16.055
MATT: Okay. You take your first step and you watch
something drift across the entrance from wall to

02:04:16.055 --> 02:04:21.897
wall. Some faint glowing figure-- and is gone.

02:04:21.897 --> 02:04:23.851
TRAVIS: (yelling) I don't like it!

02:04:23.851 --> 02:04:25.552
MARISHA: Shut up! Oh.

02:04:25.552 --> 02:04:26.869
TRAVIS: It's in my head!

02:04:26.869 --> 02:04:28.098
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

02:04:28.098 --> 02:04:30.973
TALIESIN: Did it trip my Detect Magic sense at
all?

02:04:30.973 --> 02:04:32.540
MATT: Not magic sense, no.

02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:36.487
LAURA: Is it undead, or is it a ghost?

02:04:36.487 --> 02:04:38.806
MARISHA: (whispering) It's Dashilla!

02:04:38.806 --> 02:04:41.794
TALIESIN: I'm going to do another detect undead
really quickly.

02:04:41.794 --> 02:04:45.229
MATT: Okay. Give me the specifications on that
one.

02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:52.061
TALIESIN: All right. Eyes of The Grave. As an
action you know the location of any undead within

02:04:52.061 --> 02:04:55.765
60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and
isn't protected from divination magic until the

02:04:55.765 --> 02:04:57.625
end of your next turn.

02:04:57.625 --> 02:05:01.112
MATT: Okay, got you. How long does it last?

02:05:01.112 --> 02:05:04.385
TALIESIN: Six seconds.

02:05:04.385 --> 02:05:13.284
MATT: Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this,
this is a reaction to seeing this figure pass by.

02:05:13.284 --> 02:05:20.656
You definitely get an undead sense from whatever
this figure is, and then it merges with the wall

02:05:20.656 --> 02:05:25.826
and is gone. It appeared to be loosely humanoid in
the brief glimpse you saw.

02:05:25.826 --> 02:05:27.963
TALIESIN: We have undead.

02:05:27.963 --> 02:05:30.054
TRAVIS: No.

02:05:30.054 --> 02:05:34.752
SAM: It's a ghost ship!

02:05:34.752 --> 02:05:37.823
MARISHA: Is it going to be your crew?

02:05:37.823 --> 02:05:40.205
TRAVIS: I don't know!

02:05:40.205 --> 02:05:42.859
MARISHA: Wait, we're not on your ship anymore.

02:05:42.859 --> 02:05:48.926
TRAVIS: Now we're in the mouth of a beast! Ducey,
what's going on, brother?

02:05:48.926 --> 02:05:55.494
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm literally blind. I
want to light this--

02:05:55.494 --> 02:05:59.159
SAM: Are you feeling scared down here now all of a
sudden?

02:05:59.159 --> 02:06:02.215
TALIESIN: Just to start, I'm going to throw some
light into the center of the kelp.

02:06:02.215 --> 02:06:09.201
MATT: Okay. In the center of the kelp forest that
sits in the center of the chamber, a source of

02:06:09.201 --> 02:06:16.292
light begins to emanate, like a lantern covered in
soft, diffusing material. The beams protrude and

02:06:16.292 --> 02:06:22.792
lighten up the chamber like a lantern. As it goes
through, you have a better view of the interior.

02:06:22.792 --> 02:06:35.196
You notice that the kelp forest is cluttered with
strips of cloth, bones, two or three merrow

02:06:35.196 --> 02:06:42.335
corpses that have long decomposed and look tangled
and wrapped and are held towards the ceiling.

02:06:42.335 --> 02:06:51.223
There are a handful of what might have been human
remains tangled in that same seaweed.

02:06:51.223 --> 02:06:54.274
MARISHA: Okay.

02:06:54.274 --> 02:06:57.723
TALIESIN: I think this thing is carnivorous.

02:06:57.723 --> 02:06:59.986
MARISHA: The seaweed?

02:06:59.986 --> 02:07:01.360
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:11.218
TRAVIS: I'd say burn it down, but, you know...
(singing) under the sea.

02:07:11.218 --> 02:07:12.978
MARISHA: (singing) Doo doo, ba doo.

02:07:12.978 --> 02:07:14.902
SAM: Should we leave?

02:07:14.902 --> 02:07:16.810
TALIESIN: I think we should leave.

02:07:16.810 --> 02:07:22.796
TRAVIS: You know what, who really needs the
sphere? Should we just go back to the boat? No? I

02:07:22.796 --> 02:07:30.247
didn't mean it either. All right, we move
forward.

02:07:30.247 --> 02:07:34.284
MARISHA: I don't think anyone should touch the
seaweed.

02:07:34.284 --> 02:07:35.999
TALIESIN: Yeah, lights off.

02:07:35.999 --> 02:07:38.742
LAURA: Wait, lights off?! Why lights off?!

02:07:38.742 --> 02:07:41.825
MATT: The light vanishes once more and darkness
comes to the chamber.

02:07:41.825 --> 02:07:45.792
TRAVIS: That shit's going to reach out. I don't
know how to stop it.

02:07:45.792 --> 02:07:47.955
MATT: Do you guys continue to the right chamber?

02:07:47.955 --> 02:07:48.503
SAM: Sure.

02:07:48.503 --> 02:07:49.196
LIAM: Yes, please.

02:07:49.196 --> 02:07:56.498
LAURA: I'm holding my hands up like this in case
anything reaches for me. And my axe in my hand, too.

02:07:56.518 --> 02:08:02.034
TALIESIN: I've still got a few minutes of Detect
Magic, so if anything--

02:08:02.034 --> 02:08:10.271
MATT: Understood. Fjord? You just have this gentle
chill on the back of your head, like something

02:08:10.271 --> 02:08:15.228
frozen just caressed the back of your skull and is
gone.

02:08:15.228 --> 02:08:17.984
SAM: Gentle chill, like a Jack Johnson song.

02:08:17.984 --> 02:08:23.463
TRAVIS: Don't do this to me! Everyone else at this
table is less susceptible to shit like that! Don't

02:08:23.463 --> 02:08:31.503
do it to me, okay! I don't need this right now!
Cool, no problem.

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:37.401
LAURA: Just don't make it like Ring girl, okay? Or
like The Grudge.

02:08:37.401 --> 02:08:39.660
TRAVIS: Oh, stop, why would you want to put it out
there?!

02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:40.281
LIAM: Or do.

02:08:40.281 --> 02:08:43.283
TRAVIS: (shushing)

02:08:43.283 --> 02:08:53.212
MATT: You continue forward through this tunnel
around the seaweed cluster in the center. Moving

02:08:53.212 --> 02:08:59.520
through in the same order that you situated there.
There's just enough room, maybe ten feet across,

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:07.785
to stay comfortably, you'd want to single-file it.
As you walk through, the edges of the seaweed

02:09:07.785 --> 02:09:12.863
begin to drift forward, seemingly drawn in by the
warmth of your bodies.

02:09:12.863 --> 02:09:14.017
MARISHA: What?

02:09:14.017 --> 02:09:18.844
LIAM: Wait, it's drawing towards us, or it's
pulling in?

02:09:18.844 --> 02:09:24.055
MATT: It's pulling in. There's the central section
and the wall. As you begin to move through, it

02:09:24.055 --> 02:09:27.134
begins to slowly pull in to close in towards you.

02:09:27.134 --> 02:09:31.079
LAURA: Can we freeze it? Can we cast cold on it or
something?

02:09:31.079 --> 02:09:33.023
MARISHA: Can we move fast?

02:09:33.023 --> 02:09:39.213
MATT: Moving quickly through, it's not moving
rapidly. As soon as you see this, you begin to

02:09:39.385 --> 02:09:42.947
dart through. The only person who would be in
danger is the very end. Caleb, since you're at the

02:09:42.947 --> 02:09:46.916
back, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw
for me. Because as all of you start darting

02:09:46.916 --> 02:09:51.329
through and making your way, they're drifting and
tangling in closer together.

02:09:51.329 --> 02:09:55.856
LIAM: Oh jeez, it jumped up. Well that's a six.
Seven.

02:09:55.856 --> 02:10:04.531
MATT: Okay. As you move forward, you feel a bit of
it touch your shoulder, and then it wraps around

02:10:04.531 --> 02:10:09.860
and pulls you against the wall. You guys hear this
(slamming) behind. There's a shift of water. You

02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:15.396
watch Caleb get yanked towards the right side of
the chamber. It's currently (sucking). The seaweed

02:10:15.396 --> 02:10:23.377
begins to snake its way around. Caleb, you take
five points of poison damage and are grappled.

02:10:23.377 --> 02:10:24.870
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:32.126
TRAVIS: Can I send two shots of Eldritch Blast at
the stuff around it, the kelp?

02:10:32.126 --> 02:10:35.346
MATT: Sure, I'll say two attacks with disadvantage
because you're having to aim them to try to keep

02:10:35.346 --> 02:10:36.101
around him.

02:10:36.101 --> 02:10:37.848
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Light really quickly,
too.

02:10:37.848 --> 02:10:40.630
MATT: Okay, the light fills the space.

02:10:40.630 --> 02:10:44.783
TRAVIS: First one's a 19 and not a natural 20, but
a 16.

02:10:44.783 --> 02:10:47.083
MATT: Okay, yeah. Both hit, go ahead and roll
damage.

02:10:47.083 --> 02:10:49.130
MARISHA: B-b-blast!

02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:51.562
TRAVIS: 12 and--

02:10:51.562 --> 02:10:54.355
MARISHA: Eldritch B-b-blast!

02:10:54.355 --> 02:10:56.175
TRAVIS: 26 points of damage.

02:10:56.175 --> 02:11:01.784
MATT: Okay, each side-- Both blasts of Eldritch
Blast impact the sides of the cavern wall with a

02:11:01.784 --> 02:11:08.937
dull (thud). The clusters of seaweed that
currently wrap around Caleb are torn to the point

02:11:08.937 --> 02:11:13.208
where you have enough strength to pull yourself
free, breaking the grapple. You shrug them off of

02:11:13.208 --> 02:11:17.974
you. As you're touching with your fingers, your
fingers spike with pain. No additional poison

02:11:17.974 --> 02:11:21.146
damage, necessarily, but you know staying would
continue to do so.

02:11:21.146 --> 02:11:22.405
LIAM: I'm poisoned?

02:11:22.405 --> 02:11:26.172
MATT: You are not poisoned. You just took poison
damage. You manage to pull it away and catch up

02:11:26.172 --> 02:11:30.195
with the rest of the crew. You guys are heading
towards the right chamber, which begins to rise up

02:11:30.195 --> 02:11:35.836
a bit before leveling off about 15 feet above and
about 20 feet ahead of you. The walls are still

02:11:35.836 --> 02:11:41.825
covered in this seaweed in chunks. About every
five or so feet, you see another cluster, and

02:11:41.825 --> 02:11:48.643
they're a bit scattered around the interior. A
large portion of this whole chamber network seems

02:11:48.643 --> 02:11:51.933
to be housing this same type of plant.

02:11:51.933 --> 02:11:56.733
TRAVIS: We're going to move fast, and I'm going to
keep Eldritch Blast charged, and if anything

02:11:56.733 --> 02:11:59.408
starts to reach closer than other areas of it.

02:11:59.408 --> 02:12:00.924
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:12:00.924 --> 02:12:02.560
SAM: You're good at this.

02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:08.504
LAURA: I'm going to keep Sacred Flame prepped as
well, to release it then if anything gets attacked.

02:12:08.518 --> 02:12:10.265
MATT: Okay, so you're readying the spell?

02:12:10.265 --> 02:12:11.947
LAURA: Yeah. It's just a cantrip.

02:12:11.947 --> 02:12:13.509
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine.

02:12:13.509 --> 02:12:14.870
SAM: Six!

02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:17.676
LAURA: Okay, well, get rid of it then!

02:12:17.676 --> 02:12:19.534
TRAVIS: I drink out of that.

02:12:19.534 --> 02:12:34.710
MATT: Okay. Jester, you feel this-- like a burst
of brain freeze for a second-- like something cold

02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:37.565
tickles the inside of your head. And it's gone.

02:12:37.565 --> 02:12:40.491
LAURA: This is weird.

02:12:40.491 --> 02:12:42.125
SAM: What happened?

02:12:42.125 --> 02:12:46.891
LAURA: It felt like I drank a Slurpee or
something.

02:12:46.891 --> 02:12:56.183
MATT: Caduceus, you see something shadowy shift
long down the hall up and above that barely catches

02:12:56.183 --> 02:12:58.098
your attention before it's gone.

02:12:58.098 --> 02:13:01.240
TALIESIN: Do I even have to bother, or do I know
what that is?

02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.128
MATT: You don't. It's not the same as before.

02:13:04.128 --> 02:13:06.101
TALIESIN: It's something different?

02:13:06.101 --> 02:13:12.105
MATT: From what you saw before, it was giving a
faint, pale glow and had a ghostly presence to it.

02:13:12.105 --> 02:13:14.434
This is just a movement in dark shadow.

02:13:14.434 --> 02:13:22.614
TALIESIN: Oh, then I'm going to do the Eyes of the
Grave one more time the minute I see it. There's

02:13:22.614 --> 02:13:25.481
something else down here too.

02:13:25.481 --> 02:13:27.870
SAM: Something else? Oh, great.

02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:30.892
LIAM: I'm feeling a little weary. Does anyone want
to help me out a little bit?

02:13:31.342 --> 02:13:34.672
SAM: Oh, are you hurt, Caleb? Caleb's hurt.
Someone heal Caleb.

02:13:34.672 --> 02:13:35.744
LAURA: Okay.

02:13:35.744 --> 02:13:37.088
TALIESIN: You're going to take it?

02:13:37.088 --> 02:13:38.084
LAURA: Sure.

02:13:38.084 --> 02:13:39.765
LIAM: Yeah, teamwork.

02:13:39.765 --> 02:13:41.340
TRAVIS: Yasha will--

02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:42.706
TALIESIN: Yasha can--?

02:13:42.706 --> 02:13:45.044
MATT: Yeah, she has an ability.

02:13:45.044 --> 02:13:46.624
TRAVIS: If you want to save your stuff.

02:13:46.624 --> 02:13:48.146
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's have Yasha--

02:13:48.146 --> 02:13:48.879
LAURA: Yeah.

02:13:48.879 --> 02:13:50.979
TRAVIS: Yasha will heal Caleb for seven hit points
using Healing Hands.

02:13:50.979 --> 02:13:52.363
SAM: Thanks, Ashley.

02:13:52.363 --> 02:13:53.704
LIAM: What happened just now?

02:13:53.704 --> 02:13:55.478
TRAVIS: Seven points. Healing.

02:13:55.478 --> 02:13:56.304
LIAM: Okay.

02:13:56.304 --> 02:13:58.807
TALIESIN: Did you take your 17 earlier also?

02:13:58.807 --> 02:13:59.458
LIAM: No.

02:13:59.458 --> 02:14:00.541
TALIESIN: From Prayer of Healing.

02:14:00.541 --> 02:14:01.756
LIAM: I didn't know that was for me.

02:14:01.756 --> 02:14:04.140
TALIESIN: That was for everybody.

02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:04.931
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:14:04.931 --> 02:14:07.039
TRAVIS: Did you need the seven?

02:14:07.039 --> 02:14:10.191
LIAM: Can't do the math right now.

02:14:10.191 --> 02:14:10.781
MARISHA: No.

02:14:10.781 --> 02:14:12.291
LIAM: Then I'm good.

02:14:12.291 --> 02:14:14.594
MATT: Yeah, so Yasha holds onto that, then.

02:14:14.594 --> 02:14:15.697
TALIESIN: Everyone was.

02:14:15.697 --> 02:14:17.188
LIAM: I thought that was for one person.

02:14:17.188 --> 02:14:19.241
TALIESIN: Did a group thing.

02:14:19.241 --> 02:14:23.574
MATT: All right. So continuing on?

02:14:23.574 --> 02:14:27.420
TALIESIN: Yeah. There's something up ahead.

02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:29.306
SAM: I'm going to look for traps.

02:14:29.306 --> 02:14:34.715
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a perception
check to see if you notice anything strange about

02:14:34.715 --> 02:14:36.318
the interior.

02:14:36.318 --> 02:14:39.145
SAM: 18 and a five.

02:14:39.145 --> 02:14:46.346
MATT: Okay. Looking about the area, it looks like
a natural cavern. You don't see much that would

02:14:46.346 --> 02:14:52.054
catch-- any some sort of dissembled or trap
mechanism with a trigger.

02:14:52.054 --> 02:14:53.987
SAM: We're fine. Come on.

02:14:53.987 --> 02:14:58.104
LIAM: I can light it up in here if we want. Or do
we want to?

02:14:58.104 --> 02:15:01.105
TALIESIN: They know we're here now.

02:15:01.105 --> 02:15:04.077
TRAVIS: Light it up.

02:15:04.077 --> 02:15:04.882
LIAM: Ja?

02:15:04.882 --> 02:15:06.340
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:10.101
LIAM: All right. I'm going to put the string of
globules up the passage.

02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:12.946
TRAVIS: Let's at least unrestrict Caduceus.

02:15:12.946 --> 02:15:20.427
MATT: Okay. The globules appear like lights coming
on segmented down a long hallway. As the final one

02:15:20.427 --> 02:15:28.095
glows, right behind it, you see the figure of a
man looking at you, white and pale, who then steps

02:15:28.095 --> 02:15:30.031
back into the wall and vanishes.

02:15:30.031 --> 02:15:32.771
LAURA: Oh! This is really terrible!

02:15:32.771 --> 02:15:35.255
TRAVIS: (stammering) Into the wall?

02:15:35.255 --> 02:15:37.840
LAURA: He was a ghost!

02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:46.031
SAM: While we're looking at that, I'll take the
seaweed that we used as camouflage before. You

02:15:46.031 --> 02:15:50.128
know the thing where you put an orange on your
mouth? I'm going to do that with seaweed.

02:15:50.128 --> 02:15:51.259
MARISHA: Eww.

02:15:51.259 --> 02:15:58.504
SAM: I'm going to look up at Fjord and be like:
It's already got me! Ah!

02:15:58.504 --> 02:16:08.318
TRAVIS: Nah. No big deal. An improvement.
(laughter)

02:16:08.318 --> 02:16:12.595
SAM: I'm hideous. No, he's right. I'm hideous.

02:16:12.595 --> 02:16:26.551
TRAVIS: Okay. That's the worst thing I've ever
heard or seen. Did I recognize the face?

02:16:26.551 --> 02:16:34.015
MATT: No. Because you're the closest up there,
since you're helming it in with darkvision--

02:16:34.015 --> 02:16:40.204
Darkvision wouldn't matter so much in this
instance. But the figure you saw looked to be male

02:16:40.204 --> 02:16:52.089
wearing loose fitting clothing, sunken eyes with
no actual eyes inside the sockets, pale with a

02:16:52.089 --> 02:17:02.902
faint ghostly glow about their visage. A line of
rope wrapped around one arm. Multiple loops. It

02:17:02.902 --> 02:17:05.442
just stared at you before stepping back into the
wall and vanishing.

02:17:05.442 --> 02:17:07.122
TRAVIS: God! Stop describing it!

02:17:07.122 --> 02:17:10.798
(laughter)

02:17:10.798 --> 02:17:15.790
TRAVIS: We go forward, right? Yeah.

02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:16.599
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:19.810
LAURA: Do you really want this? Do you really want
this orb though?

02:17:19.810 --> 02:17:21.591
TRAVIS: It's still in this direction, right?

02:17:21.591 --> 02:17:23.542
LAURA: (nervous) I don't know.

02:17:23.542 --> 02:17:25.856
LIAM: At least so far they are not harassing us.

02:17:25.856 --> 02:17:28.820
TRAVIS: Yeah that's true. More the plants than
anything.

02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:33.385
LAURA: Did he look menacing-- the guy? Did he just
look like--

02:17:33.385 --> 02:17:39.020
MATT: No expression. Just blank and cold. Absent
of any real emotion before it dissipated.

02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:41.051
TRAVIS: Yes, we'll keep going forward.

02:17:41.051 --> 02:17:49.244
MATT: Continuing down this path, you climb or swim
up the brief 15-foot incline to get to the next

02:17:49.488 --> 02:17:56.420
tunnel path where the orbs were spread out to
continue. You move through and the elements of

02:17:56.420 --> 02:18:01.847
seaweed that were still in there are shifting from
the water displacement ever so slightly. As you

02:18:01.847 --> 02:18:05.180
move through, same order you guys are going
through?

02:18:05.180 --> 02:18:06.272
SAM: Sure.

02:18:06.272 --> 02:18:12.493
MATT: All right. That being the case, as you push
through I need Caleb once again to make a

02:18:12.493 --> 02:18:13.651
dexterity saving throw.

02:18:13.651 --> 02:18:16.586
LIAM: Expeditious Retreat! As a reaction.

02:18:16.586 --> 02:18:19.639
MATT: Okay. Go for it. I'll let you do that.

02:18:19.639 --> 02:18:20.281
LIAM: Yep.

02:18:20.281 --> 02:18:25.428
MATT: All right. You cast Expeditious Retreat. You
manage to dart forward and out of the grasping

02:18:25.428 --> 02:18:32.976
hands of the seaweed through the use of your
spell. You catch up, now darting forward through

02:18:32.976 --> 02:18:35.689
everybody next to Jester and Fjord.

02:18:35.689 --> 02:18:38.120
MARISHA: Yeah, you want to be in the middle.

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:43.584
LIAM: Whatever I've got ten minutes of zip, baby!
Let's go forward.

02:18:43.584 --> 02:18:47.849
MATT: Okay. There. We are moving forward in that.

02:18:47.849 --> 02:18:54.671
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to tap
Resistance on you. Well I'm just going to give

02:18:54.671 --> 02:18:58.111
you-- if anything happens in the next minute you
can add a d4 to any saving throw.

02:18:58.111 --> 02:19:08.320
MATT: Okay. Following the tunnel down for another
15 to 20 or so feet it curves around to the left.

02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:12.127
Do you continue and curve around the edge?

02:19:12.127 --> 02:19:13.860
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:19.073
MATT: You come around the corner and look. You
guys are at the front. I need Jester and Fjord to

02:19:19.073 --> 02:19:23.232
make-- since you have the globes, you can move the
globes ahead if you want to.

02:19:23.232 --> 02:19:29.364
LIAM: I'll say that they're 20 feet ahead of us
and 20 feet behind.

02:19:29.364 --> 02:19:32.115
MATT: So you do not have disadvantage on your
perception checks.

02:19:32.115 --> 02:19:33.049
LAURA: 23.

02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:33.842
TRAVIS: Six.

02:19:33.842 --> 02:19:35.783
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a perception check,
then.

02:19:35.783 --> 02:19:37.184
MARISHA: It's the same thing you rolled last
time.

02:19:37.184 --> 02:19:38.464
TRAVIS: I don't understand.

02:19:38.464 --> 02:19:41.474
MATT: Well, you're further back. We'll get to you.
Because they're the ones at the front, they get to

02:19:41.474 --> 02:19:42.588
do this first.

02:19:42.588 --> 02:19:43.822
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:19:43.822 --> 02:19:47.712
MATT: But you're safer in the middle. What did you
get?

02:19:47.712 --> 02:19:48.525
LAURA: 23.

02:19:48.525 --> 02:19:54.089
MATT: As you turn around the corner and look, the
path continues for another 20 or so feet in this

02:19:54.089 --> 02:20:00.851
tunnel before it descends into a much larger
chamber. The seaweed gets thicker towards the

02:20:00.851 --> 02:20:11.556
mouth of this chamber. From the little bit of
glowing orbs that begin to extend over that edge

02:20:11.556 --> 02:20:19.283
that goes into it, what little bit of light hits
bits of gold coins scattered all throughout the

02:20:19.283 --> 02:20:20.957
floor of that next chamber.

02:20:20.957 --> 02:20:22.362
MARISHA: Don't touch them.

02:20:22.362 --> 02:20:26.698
TRAVIS: Do we dare steal a glance at the seaweed
that's around? Are there also strips of cloth and

02:20:26.885 --> 02:20:28.376
bone and body?

02:20:28.376 --> 02:20:35.018
MATT: Yes, they are, but that center cluster
seemed to have quite a few that were in there.

02:20:35.018 --> 02:20:43.878
These in the walls only have a few scattered
pieces of parts. No full bodies here in the hallway.

02:20:43.878 --> 02:20:45.619
LAURA: Less people made it this far.

02:20:45.619 --> 02:20:54.534
MATT: Beau, as you're coming around that corner
and people are looking off to the side, you glance

02:20:54.534 --> 02:21:03.388
over your shoulder and see for a split second an
older man with a curled and scraggly beard that

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:09.260
goes down to about mid-chest. The eyes are
missing. You see vacant, dark sockets. The jaw is

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:14.665
slack-jawed and open as it looks towards you. I
need you to make a charisma saving throw, please.

02:21:14.665 --> 02:21:24.987
MARISHA: Oh fuck. Not what I'm great at. Don't
fuck me, Gil. 12. Not good.

02:21:24.987 --> 02:21:34.547
MATT: It leans in towards you and-- not yet. It
leans in towards you and you feel this cold

02:21:34.547 --> 02:21:40.859
sensation over your whole body. Your muscles lock
in place and your consciousness goes dark. Out of

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:46.812
the corner of your eye you see some sort of
ghostly movement. You look over and see Beau rest

02:21:46.812 --> 02:21:49.127
into a standing position on her back foot.

02:21:49.127 --> 02:21:55.981
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to Turn Undead really
quickly, and then I'm going to go over and deal

02:21:55.981 --> 02:21:57.885
with you.

02:21:57.885 --> 02:21:59.949
MATT: What's the DC on that?

02:21:59.949 --> 02:22:05.299
TALIESIN: The DC on Turn Undead is-- let me hit
my--

02:22:05.299 --> 02:22:08.129
TRAVIS: As she's resting on her back foot, her
eyes are open?

02:22:08.129 --> 02:22:10.830
MATT: Eyes are open, yeah.

02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:19.901
TALIESIN: That's a wisdom saving throw? It's right
here so it's-- why is it not saying these things?

02:22:19.901 --> 02:22:21.823
LAURA: I don't know. Why doesn't yours have it?

02:22:21.823 --> 02:22:26.118
TALIESIN: Mine's weird. Wisdom saving throw. Oh,
so is that my--

02:22:26.118 --> 02:22:28.436
MATT: Whatever your spell DC is.

02:22:28.436 --> 02:22:30.423
TALIESIN: Oh. 16.

02:22:30.423 --> 02:22:37.466
MATT: 16. No, fails by one. It's a 14 plus one,
15.

02:22:37.466 --> 02:22:39.102
TALIESIN: Fuck off, ghost.

02:22:39.102 --> 02:22:45.764
MATT: Being a specialist in undead and already
preparing for the presence here, you glance out of

02:22:45.764 --> 02:22:52.156
the corner of your eye just in time to see the
essence of this spiritual form drift into Beau's

02:22:52.156 --> 02:23:00.851
body. As you watch that moment of consciousness
fade from her face, as the presence of Beau goes

02:23:00.851 --> 02:23:07.230
cold and whatever was in this tunnel begins to
come to the forefront, you take your staff and

02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:14.983
slam it into the ground. This wave of light energy
emerges. It impacts all of you and the water gets

02:23:14.983 --> 02:23:19.796
suddenly warm around you. As it blows past Beau,
you see strands of hair get blown back and with

02:23:19.796 --> 02:23:28.011
that, that same ghostly old man body jettisons out
the back of her and drags down the hallway into

02:23:28.011 --> 02:23:29.820
darkness and disappears.

02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:31.628
TALIESIN: Not cool, man. Not cool.

02:23:31.628 --> 02:23:34.693
MARISHA: What just happened?

02:23:34.693 --> 02:23:36.697
SAM: She's back?

02:23:36.697 --> 02:23:39.259
MARISHA: Was I Traci again?

02:23:39.259 --> 02:23:45.327
LAURA: You had a ghost that just fell out of you.
Are ghosts going to be trying to take over our minds?

02:23:45.890 --> 02:23:49.380
MARISHA: Caduceus, did you just do that?

02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:50.530
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:23:50.530 --> 02:23:52.695
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:23:52.695 --> 02:23:55.569
TALIESIN: He was creepy, man. Come on.

02:23:55.569 --> 02:23:58.933
LAURA: Have you had ghosts try to take you over
before?

02:23:58.933 --> 02:23:59.725
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:23:59.725 --> 02:24:01.917
LAURA: Whoa. Has it ever worked?

02:24:01.917 --> 02:24:06.924
TALIESIN: Not that I know of. I hope. I mean,
would you know?

02:24:06.924 --> 02:24:09.138
MARISHA: I don't know. Do I know?

02:24:09.138 --> 02:24:16.355
MATT: You have an essence after what just happened
that something weird happened and you lost yourself.

02:24:16.355 --> 02:24:20.800
TRAVIS: I have a feeling that if these dead people
invade our bodies, they're going to walk us into

02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:28.292
the walls. We should huddle together and keep a
hand on each other. If one of us stops moving,

02:24:28.292 --> 02:24:33.919
stop that person. Okay? We need to move forward
quickly.

02:24:33.919 --> 02:24:38.613
TALIESIN: Is it worth cutting through some of this
stuff?

02:24:38.613 --> 02:24:44.709
LAURA: Well, I can use Sacred Flame on the ones in
front of us and see if it will make it open in the opening?

02:24:44.709 --> 02:24:46.569
TALIESIN: I can join you for that.

02:24:46.569 --> 02:24:50.449
TRAVIS: Yeah, if it's closed our way forward, yes.
Otherwise, we should move quickly.

02:24:50.449 --> 02:24:54.368
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you glance back in the tunnel where you came from

02:24:54.368 --> 02:25:00.908
where Caduceus had jettisoned that spirit back,
and at the very edge of the light, you can see

02:25:00.908 --> 02:25:07.236
about 12 or so of these ghostly figures standing
there, unmoving--

02:25:07.236 --> 02:25:13.324
LAURA: Why are they facing us? I hate this, Fjord.
This is really terrible.

02:25:13.324 --> 02:25:16.052
TALIESIN: Let's find what we're looking for and
get out of here.

02:25:16.502 --> 02:25:17.674
SAM: Keep going!

02:25:17.674 --> 02:25:21.759
TRAVIS: With the hustle. I mean, on the hustle. On
the quick march.

02:25:21.759 --> 02:25:29.028
MATT: All right. Pushing towards and following the
orbs gliding forward, the mouth of this

02:25:29.028 --> 02:25:33.492
entranceway before it opens up is where it looks
like two larger clusters on each side of this

02:25:33.492 --> 02:25:35.709
seaweed is through. You are what?

02:25:35.709 --> 02:25:39.757
LAURA: Sacred Flame-ing one of the clusters and
he's going to Sacred Flame the other cluster.

02:25:39.757 --> 02:25:45.227
MATT: They auto-fail saving throws. They're
seaweed.

02:25:45.227 --> 02:25:50.656
(laughter)

02:25:50.656 --> 02:25:54.241
TALIESIN: Thank you. It's been a long day.

02:25:54.241 --> 02:26:03.108
MATT: Roll damage. We'll see if it's enough to
clear the way for a moment. You as well, Caduceus.

02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:05.488
LAURA: Four radiant damage.

02:26:05.488 --> 02:26:08.135
TALIESIN: Damage?

02:26:08.135 --> 02:26:13.091
LAURA: 2d8.

02:26:13.091 --> 02:26:18.152
TALIESIN: That's seven radiant damage.

02:26:18.152 --> 02:26:23.669
MATT: Okay. The side on Caduceus' edge of the
wall, you watch this blast of radiant energy

02:26:23.669 --> 02:26:29.569
emanate from the side of the wall and blow out the
center part. Some of the seaweed get released and

02:26:29.569 --> 02:26:33.882
begins to scatter and float towards the top. Your
side blasts, but it doesn't quite tear all the way

02:26:33.882 --> 02:26:41.721
through. You guys begin darting forward on the
right side. Caleb, you're the first one there.

02:26:41.721 --> 02:26:43.720
LIAM: Has it been over ten minutes?

02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:45.301
MATT: No. You're still Expeditious Retreat?

02:26:45.301 --> 02:26:47.530
LIAM: Yeah, it lasts ten minutes.

02:26:47.530 --> 02:26:52.583
MATT: All right. You dart inside the chamber ahead
of everybody else. You're now in the center of

02:26:52.583 --> 02:26:56.991
this open chamber as you stop with the globes
around you to take in the atmosphere. The rest of

02:26:56.991 --> 02:27:02.740
you are now having to catch up. Yasha needs to
make a dexterity saving throw as well.

02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:03.517
SAM: Yasha.

02:27:03.517 --> 02:27:06.770
MATT: She gets advantage because she can see it,
because of her Danger Sense.

02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:08.742
TRAVIS: Okay, that's right. Natural 20.

02:27:08.742 --> 02:27:10.739
LAURA: Oh, for Yasha.

02:27:10.739 --> 02:27:15.346
MATT: She just-- actually no, she shoulder checks
the seaweed and does not give a shit.

02:27:15.346 --> 02:27:17.373
MARISHA: It works for Yasha.

02:27:17.373 --> 02:27:19.220
TRAVIS: (as Yasha) No problem.

02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:26.907
MATT: You guys all begin to push forward. This
chamber is larger than what you came in through.

02:27:26.907 --> 02:27:35.122
It's about 50 to 60-foot diameter, continues in
for about 80 or so feet, and the height goes to

02:27:35.122 --> 02:27:44.976
about 30 to 35 feet. All the walls here are
covered in this seaweed. Make a perception check,

02:27:44.976 --> 02:27:47.946
two of you who are helming the view on this.

02:27:47.946 --> 02:27:49.475
LIAM: I'm already in there.

02:27:49.475 --> 02:27:51.199
MATT: That's true. Yeah, you make one first.

02:27:51.199 --> 02:27:54.986
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll take it. 23.

02:27:54.986 --> 02:27:55.673
LIAM: 15.

02:27:55.673 --> 02:28:00.399
MATT: Okay. Glancing around, you can see areas
where the seaweed is slowly shifting from the

02:28:00.646 --> 02:28:05.521
movement of Caleb's Expeditious Retreat. What was
once still shifts, and you can see elements of the

02:28:05.521 --> 02:28:17.111
stone wall behind it. Your eyes barely make out a
handful of small carvings in the wall. Small runic

02:28:17.111 --> 02:28:24.885
letters that are not in line, but at angle
sporadically carved at places, but where the

02:28:24.885 --> 02:28:26.575
seaweed moves over and blocks it.

02:28:26.575 --> 02:28:31.529
TALIESIN: Does my Detect Magic-- which I think is
just barely still up? I don't feel like this has

02:28:31.529 --> 02:28:33.703
been a ten-minute venture since that.

02:28:33.703 --> 02:28:37.318
MATT: Yeah, I'd say you're pushing the edge on
this one.

02:28:37.318 --> 02:28:39.468
TALIESIN: It's not much longer, I know.

02:28:39.468 --> 02:28:46.828
MATT: I'd say as you step into this chamber-- are
you heading to the center of it?

02:28:46.828 --> 02:28:49.567
TALIESIN: No, I'm just coming in and looking
around.

02:28:49.567 --> 02:28:53.604
MATT: As you're standing at the mouth of this,
just past the edge, you do not detect anything

02:28:53.604 --> 02:28:58.536
particularly magical. Then as you take your first
step into the chamber, you see this. You almost

02:28:58.536 --> 02:29:07.917
run into it. In the middle of this chamber, there
is a small two-foot pedestal and a disc, a stone

02:29:07.917 --> 02:29:15.462
disc about that wide and about two feet from edge
to edge that is resting on it but at an angle. It

02:29:15.462 --> 02:29:25.779
looks old. It looks weathered and there appears to
be a spiral of runes, two sets of them, that curve

02:29:25.779 --> 02:29:31.214
inward around each other before merging in the
center with one singular sigil where they meet.

02:29:31.214 --> 02:29:37.834
LIAM: Are these arcane glyphs, or is this
language?

02:29:37.834 --> 02:29:41.123
MATT: They are arcane glyphs. If you'd like to
make an arcana check, if you want to take a moment

02:29:41.123 --> 02:29:41.781
to study.

02:29:41.781 --> 02:29:50.893
MARISHA: Is this our answer as to why this entire
area eats ships?

02:29:50.893 --> 02:29:53.207
TRAVIS: Could be.

02:29:53.207 --> 02:29:55.618
LAURA: Is Uk'otoa here?

02:29:55.618 --> 02:29:57.402
TRAVIS: No. Well--

02:29:57.402 --> 02:29:59.414
SAM: Yes, sort of.

02:29:59.414 --> 02:30:01.001
MARISHA: It's a temple?

02:30:01.001 --> 02:30:01.970
LIAM: 24.

02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:04.017
SAM: It's one of the three gates, right?

02:30:04.017 --> 02:30:07.287
TRAVIS: Could be. There would need to be a spot
for an orb.

02:30:07.287 --> 02:30:09.544
MARISHA: Is this what Vandren was going for?

02:30:09.544 --> 02:30:12.538
TRAVIS: It's not what I saw in my dream.

02:30:12.538 --> 02:30:20.863
MATT: These runes, this whole incantation, this
enchantment or whatever that sits in this is old,

02:30:20.863 --> 02:30:28.956
pre-Calamity, Age of Arcana-level magic. It is
dormant currently. It looks like there is

02:30:28.956 --> 02:30:40.320
something that is required to infuse this object
with power or to get it to use whatever its

02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:51.300
enchantment is. The more you look over it, you
realize the power's beyond anything you've cast.

02:30:51.300 --> 02:31:03.711
The nature of it seems to be conjuration, and it
seems to have a lot of the base runes that you've

02:31:03.711 --> 02:31:16.722
used to manipulate fire, you've used to manipulate
earth. It's elemental in nature. You continue to

02:31:16.722 --> 02:31:24.384
look over it and get the sense that this is
triggered by some sort of-- there's a physical

02:31:24.384 --> 02:31:30.919
material that needs to be brought to this table or
brought as part of this ritual, and in doing so

02:31:30.919 --> 02:31:34.516
would conjure some sort of powerful elemental
force.

02:31:34.516 --> 02:31:43.034
LIAM: Did I pick up on the fact that Caduceus was
looking at glyphs in the wall? Did I see those as well?

02:31:43.285 --> 02:31:44.345
MATT: No, you did not.

02:31:44.345 --> 02:31:45.438
LIAM: No? Okay.

02:31:45.438 --> 02:31:50.700
MATT: You do feel this faint, cold, brushing
sensation at the back of your skull.

02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:52.969
LAURA: What the fuck is that?

02:31:52.969 --> 02:32:03.489
TALIESIN: I think it's maybe time for another
detect object. I'll take this one. I'm going to

02:32:03.489 --> 02:32:05.066
cast Locate Object.

02:32:05.066 --> 02:32:09.147
MATT: Okay. You cast Locate Object, focusing on?

02:32:09.147 --> 02:32:10.962
TALIESIN: On the stone.

02:32:10.962 --> 02:32:15.192
MATT: You step forward and can see in the far,
back side of the chamber. As you guys get a look

02:32:15.192 --> 02:32:21.951
around, clustered in with the base of the walls
where the seaweed is thick, you begin to see as

02:32:21.951 --> 02:32:29.065
the light around the chamber comes to touch it,
and you see it first, there are piles of salvaged

02:32:29.065 --> 02:32:39.091
goods: gold and silver dishware. Clusters of
coins: gold, platinum, copper, silver, all in

02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:45.744
various levels of grime that have gathered on
them, but the shine still shows through in places.

02:32:45.744 --> 02:32:55.342
You can see tools that were haphazardly pulled and
gathered and jammed into pockets in the walls.

02:32:55.342 --> 02:33:04.478
It's like a nightmarish Ariel's grotto, almost.
You immediately realize that this is all things

02:33:04.478 --> 02:33:10.449
that have been salvaged and pulled from all the
ships that have sunk and brought in. The floor

02:33:10.449 --> 02:33:15.479
you've been stepping on, that's been somewhat soft
to the occasional crunch, you glance down and

02:33:15.479 --> 02:33:31.087
realize, is just bones. Just hundreds of human and
humanoid bones that have all been gently dusted

02:33:31.087 --> 02:33:34.598
with the general sand and silt of the interior of
this chamber.

02:33:34.598 --> 02:33:38.844
MARISHA: It feels like everything is being sucked
to this location.

02:33:38.844 --> 02:33:40.452
TRAVIS: 30-foot ceiling, right?

02:33:40.452 --> 02:33:46.364
MATT: There is a throne, a chair of some kind that
sits on the opposite side of the room. That's at a

02:33:46.364 --> 02:33:52.761
slight angle, resting against the stone, and you
immediately know that's precisely where the object

02:33:52.761 --> 02:33:55.900
you seek resides, somewhere around or with that.

02:33:55.900 --> 02:33:57.917
TALIESIN: It's by the chair.

02:33:57.917 --> 02:34:00.104
LAURA: There's a chair?!

02:34:00.104 --> 02:34:01.595
TRAVIS: How far away is it?

02:34:01.595 --> 02:34:03.902
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you mean chair?

02:34:03.902 --> 02:34:10.708
MATT: You guys are standing towards the entrance,
like the stairs and the decline that leads inside.

02:34:10.708 --> 02:34:18.946
Caleb's the only one that's actually in the center
of the chamber by this table, this thing that

02:34:18.946 --> 02:34:20.613
you've been studying.

02:34:20.613 --> 02:34:23.398
LAURA: Where are the ghosts? They're just hanging
out?

02:34:23.398 --> 02:34:25.104
MATT: You glance over your shoulder?

02:34:25.104 --> 02:34:25.701
LAURA: Yeah.

02:34:25.701 --> 02:34:26.749
MATT: About 15 feet behind you.

02:34:26.749 --> 02:34:29.061
(yelling and groaning)

02:34:29.061 --> 02:34:31.039
MATT: Not moving. Just looking at you.

02:34:31.039 --> 02:34:33.236
LAURA: (distressed yell)

02:34:33.236 --> 02:34:35.716
TRAVIS: We're being herded. That's great.

02:34:35.716 --> 02:34:42.948
LIAM: What you told me was that studying this
thing, it seems to require elements to set it in

02:34:42.948 --> 02:34:46.514
motion? How did you describe it?

02:34:46.514 --> 02:34:54.105
MATT: As you're getting closer, because the arcana
is not an immediate thing, it's a slow process of

02:34:54.105 --> 02:35:02.292
study. There's a heavy elemental conjuring that
this is capable of doing. It's very old, primal

02:35:02.292 --> 02:35:12.140
magic. Looking at the stone, the stains, and the
interior of these ruins, there is distinctly a

02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:18.303
dark brown tint to elements of this table.

02:35:18.303 --> 02:35:22.168
SAM: Some might say amber?

02:35:22.168 --> 02:35:34.197
MATT: As you scrape some of it with your
fingernail, it flakes off. It has a consistency

02:35:34.197 --> 02:35:39.618
you're familiar with, that of a coagulated blood.

02:35:39.618 --> 02:35:41.388
SAM: Ooh.

02:35:44.928 --> 02:35:54.768
MATT: Caduceus, as you're looking over towards the
throne, you look up and about ten feet above the

02:35:54.980 --> 02:36:03.222
throne, standing up in the seaweed holding onto
the clusters of it, you see a female humanoid form

02:36:03.222 --> 02:36:11.043
mostly in shadow, hair down over the front of the
face, one yellow eye peeking through on this side,

02:36:11.043 --> 02:36:16.616
and one half-open yellow eye glancing through, up
against the wall.

02:36:16.616 --> 02:36:19.145
TALIESIN: She's right above the throne.

02:36:19.145 --> 02:36:24.982
MARISHA: The song. Her hungry eye. It's in her
fucking head.

02:36:24.982 --> 02:36:33.927
MATT: You watch as she scrambles across the side
of the wall, behind the seaweed, and is gone.

02:36:33.927 --> 02:36:34.807
SAM: She's gone?

02:36:34.807 --> 02:36:38.123
LAURA, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: (yelling) No!

02:36:38.123 --> 02:36:39.169
MATT: Let's roll initiative.

02:36:39.169 --> 02:36:41.375
(yelling)

02:36:41.375 --> 02:36:43.237
LIAM: It is The Ring!

02:36:43.237 --> 02:36:50.772
LAURA: Oh my god! We're fighting The Grudge. I'll
throw up.

02:36:50.772 --> 02:36:52.700
MARISHA: Natural 20!

02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:56.042
TALIESIN: 19! Plus one, so that's 20.

02:36:56.042 --> 02:36:57.808
LAURA: Woo! I got 20 as well!

02:36:57.808 --> 02:36:59.408
TALIESIN: Oh fuck.

02:36:59.408 --> 02:37:02.278
LAURA: Just two clerics at 20.

02:37:02.278 --> 02:37:03.822
SAM: This sucks.

02:37:03.822 --> 02:37:06.341
TRAVIS: Oh shit. What?!

02:37:06.341 --> 02:37:07.911
LAURA and MARISHA: Whoa!

02:37:07.911 --> 02:37:09.669
SAM: Two map night!

02:37:09.669 --> 02:37:10.903
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

02:37:10.903 --> 02:37:13.566
TALIESIN: Fuck. This is so much worse than I was
imagining.

02:37:13.566 --> 02:37:14.851
SAM: Where are we?

02:37:14.851 --> 02:37:16.228
LIAM: There's the throne over there.

02:37:16.228 --> 02:37:18.786
MATT: This is the chamber you're in right now.
This is the entrance.

02:37:18.786 --> 02:37:20.679
TRAVIS: Hey, look! We picked the right way to go!

02:37:20.679 --> 02:37:22.524
MATT: Yeah, you did.

02:37:22.524 --> 02:37:24.868
TRAVIS: What was in the other ones?

02:37:24.868 --> 02:37:26.880
TALIESIN: An encounter.

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:35.583
MATT: So, Caleb, you are up against here. The rest
of you are just coming down the entrance this way.

02:37:35.583 --> 02:37:38.205
Tell me whereabouts you were placed around the
base.

02:37:38.205 --> 02:37:39.979
MARISHA: Fuck, that's tiny.

02:37:39.979 --> 02:37:47.465
LAURA: I feel like I would still be on the stairs
because I was looking back at the ghosts.

02:37:47.465 --> 02:37:54.931
MATT: That's true. I'll put you and Caduceus kind
of up towards the top, there. You guys are back here.

02:37:56.932 --> 02:37:59.612
MARISHA: I'd have been near Fjord, probably.

02:37:59.612 --> 02:38:05.085
MATT: Yeah, so you'll be up here with the rest of
them. The shape you saw up in this direction

02:38:05.085 --> 02:38:07.071
before it vanished.

02:38:07.071 --> 02:38:09.671
SAM: She's just a little thing!

02:38:09.671 --> 02:38:11.040
LIAM: So is Nott the Brave.

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:14.695
TRAVIS: Why would you even say that to the DM? You
know how much shit he has back there?

02:38:14.695 --> 02:38:16.683
SAM: Yeah, it's just one person.

02:38:16.683 --> 02:38:17.751
LAURA: Stop it.

02:38:17.751 --> 02:38:20.997
SAM: Didn't look like she even had any weapons!

02:38:20.997 --> 02:38:24.584
TRAVIS: Did you ever see Cabin in the Woods? Do
you know how bad this is going to get?

02:38:24.584 --> 02:38:27.980
MATT: Dashilla rolled really good initiative. So,
who's up first? 25 to 20.

02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:28.735
MARISHA: 24.

02:38:28.735 --> 02:38:29.800
LAURA: 20.

02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:30.652
TALIESIN: 20.

02:38:30.652 --> 02:38:32.432
SAM: Whoa.

02:38:32.432 --> 02:38:34.797
TRAVIS: Beau, Jester, and Cad both have 20s?

02:38:34.797 --> 02:38:36.077
LAURA: No, Beau had 24.

02:38:36.077 --> 02:38:46.331
MATT: All right. 20 to 15.

02:38:46.331 --> 02:38:48.441
TRAVIS: I had a 16.

02:38:48.441 --> 02:38:52.733
MATT: Fjord at a 16. 15 to ten.

02:38:52.733 --> 02:38:53.865
SAM: 12.

02:38:53.865 --> 02:38:58.790
MATT: Nott. Ten to five.

02:38:58.790 --> 02:39:01.312
TRAVIS: Yasha had a seven.

02:39:01.312 --> 02:39:03.863
LAURA: Oh god. Caleb.

02:39:03.863 --> 02:39:04.721
MATT: Caleb?

02:39:04.721 --> 02:39:05.548
LIAM: Four.

02:39:05.548 --> 02:39:07.425
MATT: All righty.

02:39:07.425 --> 02:39:11.885
LIAM: I'm assuming the ten minutes for Expeditious
is gone from studying the table?

02:39:11.885 --> 02:39:16.756
MATT: No, I'd say it took you two or three minutes
to study, so Expeditious is still on the table.

02:39:16.756 --> 02:39:21.009
LIAM: A minute or two left. Okay. Great, I'll take
it.

02:39:21.009 --> 02:39:26.460
MATT: Beginning of this round. The only person
that's seen this entity is Caduceus.

02:39:26.460 --> 02:39:28.830
TALIESIN: I can't see them anymore?

02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:36.433
MATT: No. They seem to have shifted into this
thick forest of seaweed that tends to wrap around

02:39:36.433 --> 02:39:45.229
all the walls of this chamber. Beau, you're up
first.

02:39:45.229 --> 02:39:49.938
MARISHA: I don't see anything. I look around?

02:39:49.938 --> 02:39:53.002
MATT: You can use your action to try and perceive
if you want to.

02:39:53.624 --> 02:39:58.200
MARISHA: I go: Caduceus! Then I look around and
see if I see anything.

02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:01.276
MATT: Okay, so you use the search action. Roll a
perception check.

02:40:01.276 --> 02:40:04.903
MARISHA: (whispering) God fucking bullshit.
Eight.

02:40:04.903 --> 02:40:09.493
MATT: Eight? Unfortunately, no. You look around
the vicinity and glancing up around, and you see

02:40:09.493 --> 02:40:14.560
movement from the water that's being disturbed,
but no sight of any particular entity.

02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:22.430
MARISHA: I move towards Caleb and kind of
bodyguard him. I am going to take the Patient

02:40:22.430 --> 02:40:28.038
Defense. Yeah, that works. I'm going to take the
Patient Defense.

02:40:28.038 --> 02:40:30.301
MATT: Okay. Bonus action to Patient Defense.

02:40:30.301 --> 02:40:31.422
MARISHA: Action, yep.

02:40:31.422 --> 02:40:37.565
MATT: Okay. That finishes Beau's turn. Caduceus
and Jester, you guys can decide which of you goes first.

02:40:38.374 --> 02:40:40.774
TALIESIN: I was just going to cast Bless. Entirely
up to you.

02:40:40.774 --> 02:40:41.423
LAURA: Okay.

02:40:41.423 --> 02:40:46.084
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bless on myself--

02:40:46.084 --> 02:40:48.623
MATT: Is Bless concentration?

02:40:48.623 --> 02:40:55.040
TALIESIN: Bless is concentration. So, I'm casting
Bless on myself, on Caleb, and on Fjord.

02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:58.987
MATT: All right, so you guys get to add a d4 to
your attack rolls and saving throws.

02:40:58.987 --> 02:41:02.813
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Okay. (belch) Okay.

02:41:02.813 --> 02:41:10.143
LAURA: I'm going to cast Spiritual Guardians. Oh,
sorry.

02:41:10.143 --> 02:41:13.243
TALIESIN: Also, I'm going to back up into the wall
so I can keep an eye down that.

02:41:13.243 --> 02:41:15.244
LAURA: Not too close to the wall because of the
seaweed.

02:41:15.244 --> 02:41:18.116
TALIESIN: Well, no. See that little thing, that
little node behind me?

02:41:18.116 --> 02:41:19.434
MATT: Right here?

02:41:19.434 --> 02:41:22.289
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I can't be attacked from
behind, but also I can keep an eye on--

02:41:22.289 --> 02:41:24.162
MATT: Okay, so you go against the wall?

02:41:24.162 --> 02:41:25.719
TALIESIN: As long as there's no seaweed there.

02:41:25.719 --> 02:41:26.605
MATT: There's seaweed there.

02:41:26.605 --> 02:41:28.095
TALIESIN: Oh, then I'm not going against the wall.
I'm sorry.

02:41:28.095 --> 02:41:29.666
MATT: All the walls are coated in this.

02:41:29.666 --> 02:41:34.810
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to take a step or two
down to scatter us a little bit more.

02:41:34.810 --> 02:41:35.843
MATT: Down this way?

02:41:35.843 --> 02:41:37.773
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, it's a little weird.

02:41:37.773 --> 02:41:39.070
MATT: Okay, I'll put you there.

02:41:39.070 --> 02:41:40.968
TALIESIN: Thank you. Yeah, anyway, I know.

02:41:40.968 --> 02:41:44.923
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn, Caduceus.
That finishes your turn, Jester. Okay, Jester,

02:41:44.923 --> 02:41:46.600
you're casting Spiritual Guardians?

02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:49.293
LAURA: Yes. I'm going to step a couple steps
toward Fjord.

02:41:49.293 --> 02:41:51.235
MATT: There alongside him.

02:41:51.235 --> 02:41:54.806
LAURA: Down to the-- yeah, okay. Then, yes, I'm
going to--

02:41:54.806 --> 02:41:56.267
MATT: Well, where do you want to go? If you want
to move--

02:41:56.267 --> 02:41:59.599
LAURA: Well, I wanted to not be quite in a line
with everybody else. I was going to be on the

02:41:59.599 --> 02:42:01.132
steps, if that's possible.

02:42:01.132 --> 02:42:05.304
MATT: Here? Yeah, we'll make it work. There,
sure.

02:42:05.304 --> 02:42:12.509
LAURA: You'll know I'm there. Yeah, sure. I go
like this. They're the little spiritual unicorns,

02:42:12.509 --> 02:42:16.285
but they're seahorses because we're underwater.

02:42:16.285 --> 02:42:17.566
MARISHA: Cute!

02:42:17.566 --> 02:42:23.872
MATT: Now all these little glowing pink seahorses
now surround you. 15-foot, right?

02:42:23.872 --> 02:42:25.768
LAURA: Yeah, 15 feet around me.

02:42:25.768 --> 02:42:33.406
MATT: Got it, okay. You have that up. You are also
now concentrating on Spiritual Guardians. That

02:42:33.406 --> 02:42:35.430
finishes Jester's turn there.

02:42:35.430 --> 02:42:36.889
MARISHA: It's so cute.

02:42:36.889 --> 02:42:40.436
MATT: That brings us to-- what did you guys both
roll initiative on?

02:42:40.436 --> 02:42:41.690
LAURA and TALIESIN: 20.

02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:45.157
MATT: Okay, so concurrent with your turn, lair
action.

02:42:45.157 --> 02:42:47.041
TALIESIN: Fuck.

02:42:47.041 --> 02:42:49.158
SAM and MARISHA: Lair action!

02:42:49.158 --> 02:42:50.770
MATT: At this point--

02:42:50.770 --> 02:42:53.311
TRAVIS: Matt, this isn't a dragon. They don't get
lair actions.

02:42:53.311 --> 02:42:59.423
MATT: You're in the lair of Dashilla. For this
lair action, it's going to use Lament of the Dead.

02:42:59.423 --> 02:43:08.713
As you all stand here, rising out of the ground,
dozens of spirits begin to drift up, of various

02:43:08.713 --> 02:43:16.639
drowned sailors and scavengers, out of the ground
and up toward the ceiling. I need everybody inside

02:43:16.639 --> 02:43:18.751
to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

02:43:18.751 --> 02:43:21.750
TALIESIN: If you have the d4, you can use the d4.

02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:23.739
TRAVIS: Oh, right, okay. Thank you.

02:43:23.739 --> 02:43:26.877
SAM: Wait, did you give a d4 to everybody?

02:43:26.877 --> 02:43:31.558
TALIESIN: No, just to Fjord. Wisdom saving throw.
Ha!

02:43:31.558 --> 02:43:41.047
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a five. Fjord rolled a 16.

02:43:41.047 --> 02:43:42.545
LIAM: Son of a bitch.

02:43:42.545 --> 02:43:55.884
MATT: Fjord, you're fine. Yasha is frightened of
Dashilla until the end of the round. Caleb?

02:43:55.884 --> 02:43:56.938
LIAM: Frightened.

02:43:56.938 --> 02:43:58.313
MARISHA: 13.

02:43:58.313 --> 02:44:04.962
MATT: You succeed. You manage to resist the fear
effect.

02:44:04.962 --> 02:44:06.484
SAM: Two.

02:44:06.484 --> 02:44:08.506
MATT: Oh, Nott.

02:44:08.506 --> 02:44:10.704
SAM: Nope, Nott's immune to fear.

02:44:10.704 --> 02:44:12.980
MATT: That's right, because you're drunk!

02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:17.516
(yelling)

02:44:17.516 --> 02:44:19.116
MATT: You're like, come at me, spirits!

02:44:19.116 --> 02:44:21.984
LAURA: I never knew there was anything good about
the drunk!

02:44:21.984 --> 02:44:24.868
MARISHA: It hasn't come into play!

02:44:24.868 --> 02:44:27.248
MATT: Nott becomes Nott the Brave when she's
drunk.

02:44:27.248 --> 02:44:28.965
TRAVIS: Amazing!

02:44:28.965 --> 02:44:32.332
MATT: So unaffected. Spirits, whatever!

02:44:32.332 --> 02:44:33.821
SAM: Fuck you!

02:44:33.821 --> 02:44:35.964
MATT: You've been braving the ocean for half a
day.

02:44:35.964 --> 02:44:38.628
LIAM: Fuck you! Come at me, you sea hag!

02:44:38.628 --> 02:44:39.422
LAURA: 14.

02:44:39.422 --> 02:44:41.205
MATT: You manage to resist it.

02:44:41.205 --> 02:44:45.856
TALIESIN: 28. The fuck is this shit? Who the fuck
are you people?

02:44:45.856 --> 02:44:55.792
MATT: As the spirits rise, this haunting, wailing
sound reverberates in the chamber. Both Caleb and

02:44:55.792 --> 02:45:02.795
Yasha, their eyes go wide, and their breathing
begins to increase. You guys are frightened of

02:45:02.795 --> 02:45:06.246
Dashilla to the end of the turn. Now it comes to
Dashilla's turn.

02:45:06.246 --> 02:45:07.684
TRAVIS: I can take care of that.

02:45:07.684 --> 02:45:15.034
MATT: Suddenly, tearing through the seaweed on the
upper wall, you see this figure emerge now. This

02:45:15.034 --> 02:45:26.688
pale, aqua-green skin that's bulbous and strangely
proportioned. These long, clawed hands. As the

02:45:26.688 --> 02:45:34.110
hair pulls back, you can see, where would be a
humanoid face instead are these protracted, almost

02:45:34.110 --> 02:45:42.918
anglerfish-type teeth that come out of the front,
with no nose, and the yellow eyes gleaming from

02:45:42.918 --> 02:45:46.015
underneath. She's going to look straight down at
you, Caleb.

02:45:46.015 --> 02:45:47.287
LAURA: No!

02:45:47.287 --> 02:45:50.026
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for
me, please.

02:45:50.026 --> 02:45:51.401
LIAM: Another one? Oh, good.

02:45:51.401 --> 02:45:56.833
MARISHA: My bodyguarding doesn't do shit. Stop
looking at him!

02:45:56.833 --> 02:46:05.680
MATT: Natural one? As she looks, she's still up in
the air, swimming, looking at you. Mouth opens,

02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:14.041
and you feel the deepest, most horrifying fear
well up inside you. Your heart stops, and you drop

02:46:14.041 --> 02:46:15.236
to zero hit points.

02:46:15.236 --> 02:46:17.569
TRAVIS: Oh my fucking god!

02:46:17.569 --> 02:46:23.390
MATT: You guys watch Caleb go (creaking) and start
drifting there, unconscious.

02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:25.540
SAM: Oh, fuck.

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:36.861
MATT: Dashilla, now hovering in the space, is
going to move over. She moves over to the side of

02:46:36.861 --> 02:46:44.320
the wall here, still visible, now jumping and
using and holding onto the seaweed like it's a

02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:49.729
tether. All right.

02:46:49.729 --> 02:46:51.484
LIAM: Really could have used that periapt right
about now.

02:46:51.484 --> 02:46:53.034
TRAVIS: The what?

02:46:53.034 --> 02:46:57.000
MATT: The periapt. That ends her turn. Fjord,
you're up.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.571
TRAVIS: Is she visible?

02:46:59.571 --> 02:47:02.256
MATT: She's visible. She's up on the wall on this
side.

02:47:02.256 --> 02:47:04.490
TALIESIN: I got this. I've got him.

02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:08.157
MATT: Remember, you guys are still underwater.
Aside from Fjord, you're all half speed.

02:47:08.157 --> 02:47:11.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:13.616
LIAM: Oh, the lights are out.

02:47:13.616 --> 02:47:15.444
TALIESIN: I still have my light.

02:47:15.444 --> 02:47:16.393
MATT: Yeah.

02:47:16.393 --> 02:47:18.775
MARISHA: And his sword? Is his sword out?

02:47:18.775 --> 02:47:20.718
MATT: The sword does give a faint bit of light.

02:47:20.718 --> 02:47:22.198
LAURA: And my axe!

02:47:22.198 --> 02:47:31.929
TRAVIS: I'll use my speed to close to the
pedestal, between the pedestal and Dashilla.

02:47:31.929 --> 02:47:32.988
MATT: Right there?

02:47:32.988 --> 02:47:46.324
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'll stop short of her. I will
use a bonus action to cast Hex on her.

02:47:46.324 --> 02:47:49.541
MATT: She is hexed. You have already used your--

02:47:49.541 --> 02:47:51.974
TRAVIS: Hexblade's Curse, yeah.

02:47:51.974 --> 02:47:59.966
MATT: As she's holding up there, looking down at
you, the murkiness of the nearby waters in the

02:47:59.966 --> 02:48:04.662
movement begins to form around her and almost try
and claw at her throat, like the shadows

02:48:04.662 --> 02:48:07.612
themselves are trying to pull at her clavicle.

02:48:07.612 --> 02:48:13.545
TRAVIS: I will gather two Eldritch Blasts in my
hands and fire them both at her.

02:48:13.545 --> 02:48:14.466
MATT: Roll two attacks.

02:48:14.466 --> 02:48:16.053
TALIESIN: With extra d4s on both.

02:48:16.053 --> 02:48:20.670
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you. One is a natural 20.

02:48:20.670 --> 02:48:22.161
MATT: Yeah, it is!

02:48:22.161 --> 02:48:25.956
TRAVIS: The other is a 17 plus four for a 21.

02:48:25.956 --> 02:48:30.635
MATT: Both hit. You don't even need the d4s on
that. Roll damage on the critical first.

02:48:30.936 --> 02:48:37.972
TRAVIS: I roll an extra d6 for the Hex, okay. So
the critical first. 1d10 plus four. That's a one.

02:48:37.972 --> 02:48:41.617
MATT: So two, but roll the d6, which is also
doubled.

02:48:41.617 --> 02:48:43.429
TRAVIS: That's a six.

02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:45.598
MATT: So 12, so that's 14 plus your--

02:48:45.598 --> 02:48:47.050
TRAVIS: Plus four.

02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:52.752
MATT: That's 18 points of damage on that one. And
damage for the second one?

02:48:52.752 --> 02:49:01.400
TRAVIS: Is a nine plus four, 13. Five, 18 points
of damage.

02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:07.800
MATT: Well, look at that. 36 points of damage on a
cantrip and a Hex. That's how warlocks are done.

02:49:08.775 --> 02:49:17.055
So as she's up there, as the Hex constrains around
her, both Eldritch Blasts hit. From both blasts,

02:49:17.055 --> 02:49:22.174
there's these dark scar marks on the upper torso
and one off the shoulder where they impact. The

02:49:22.174 --> 02:49:28.293
head curls up and (creaking) back in your
direction. The eyes seem to bulge angrily toward you.

02:49:28.293 --> 02:49:29.470
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:49:29.470 --> 02:49:30.859
MATT: Does that end your turn?

02:49:30.859 --> 02:49:33.883
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

02:49:33.883 --> 02:49:42.869
MATT: Okay. At the end of your turn, she's going
to use one of her legendary actions to use Forced

02:49:42.869 --> 02:49:49.826
Vision. At some point during this adventure, as
she was trailing you throughout the cavern and

02:49:50.045 --> 02:49:54.376
watching from a distance, she ensorceled a number
of your members of the party, you being one of them.

02:49:54.376 --> 02:49:55.520
MARISHA: She what?

02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:57.668
LAURA: That was the cold thingies.

02:49:57.668 --> 02:49:59.998
TRAVIS: Was she invisible?

02:49:59.998 --> 02:50:04.780
MATT: She was hiding through all the seaweed, and
no one was rolling high enough perception to see

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:08.808
her. You saw her move once because she didn't roll
high enough stealth on that one.

02:50:08.808 --> 02:50:11.014
MARISHA: What the fuck is about to happen?

02:50:11.014 --> 02:50:12.805
TRAVIS: And this is Forced Vision?

02:50:12.805 --> 02:50:18.281
MATT: Correct. You are not immediately in melee
with anybody, but she's going to force you to

02:50:18.281 --> 02:50:23.200
move. You glance. All of a sudden you see her out
of the corner of your eye. She's not there

02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:28.295
anymore. She's off there. You rush in her
direction after her, compelled to move over this

02:50:28.295 --> 02:50:32.353
side right up against the wall, between the wall
and Beau. You get there, and she's gone. You look

02:50:32.353 --> 02:50:37.286
back, and she never left. You shake your head for
a second. That's one legendary action done. Next

02:50:37.286 --> 02:50:39.052
turn is Nott.

02:50:39.052 --> 02:50:47.538
SAM: I will move to the left, my left, near that
pillar thing, yeah, and bonus action hide behind it.

02:50:47.887 --> 02:50:51.178
MATT: Okay. You move over there. So bonus action,
hide.

02:50:51.178 --> 02:50:55.321
SAM: Shit, not great. 16.

02:50:55.321 --> 02:50:56.487
MATT: 16 hits.

02:50:56.487 --> 02:50:59.139
SAM: No, 16, that's the hide.

02:50:59.139 --> 02:51:00.787
MATT: Sorry, that's right. Yeah.

02:51:00.787 --> 02:51:03.496
SAM: I don't know if that hides me enough. Is
that--?

02:51:03.496 --> 02:51:04.983
MATT: You don't know. You'll find out.

02:51:04.983 --> 02:51:06.742
SAM: Okay. And I will attack.

02:51:06.742 --> 02:51:08.767
MATT: All right. So you dart from behind and
fire.

02:51:08.767 --> 02:51:12.970
SAM: I shoot at a 25 or something like that.

02:51:12.970 --> 02:51:19.242
MATT: That indeed hits. And she didn't roll very
well for perception, so you do get sneak attack on this.

02:51:19.863 --> 02:51:22.409
SAM: All right! Yeah. Okay.

02:51:22.409 --> 02:51:24.123
LAURA: Yeah, that's good.

02:51:24.123 --> 02:51:27.103
SAM: 21 plus five is--

02:51:27.103 --> 02:51:28.952
LAURA: (singing) 26

02:51:28.952 --> 02:51:33.670
SAM: Plus Fury of the Small is another seven,
right? Is that that works now?

02:51:33.670 --> 02:51:34.573
MATT: 33

02:51:34.573 --> 02:51:35.811
SAM: Yeah, 33.

02:51:35.811 --> 02:51:41.017
MATT: So darting from the side and letting the
bubbles go by. She is within 30 feet of you, so

02:51:41.310 --> 02:51:49.610
you do not have the disadvantage. It catches her
in the chest, and her hands go forward and she

02:51:49.610 --> 02:51:58.210
leans out of the seaweed for a second to pull it
out and let it fall as it slowly begins to drift

02:51:58.210 --> 02:52:03.270
down, sinking into the chamber before reaching
back up into the seaweed and holding on to it.

02:52:03.270 --> 02:52:04.830
SAM: That is not sanitary.

02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:06.343
TRAVIS: Does she take poison damage?

02:52:06.343 --> 02:52:09.435
MATT: No. She is immune to the effect of the
seaweed.

02:52:09.435 --> 02:52:12.366
SAM: That makes a little sense.

02:52:12.366 --> 02:52:16.232
TRAVIS: Unfortunate. Unfortunate.

02:52:16.232 --> 02:52:17.887
MATT: So, is that your turn?

02:52:17.887 --> 02:52:19.381
SAM: That's my turn. I've done everything.

02:52:19.381 --> 02:52:22.529
MATT: All righty. Finishing Nott's go, Yasha's up.
Yasha is frightened.

02:52:22.529 --> 02:52:26.913
TRAVIS: She will rage with her bonus action and no
longer be frightened or charmed.

02:52:26.913 --> 02:52:29.587
MATT: She can do that?

02:52:29.587 --> 02:52:31.662
TRAVIS: Doesn't rage break--

02:52:31.662 --> 02:52:37.875
MATT: Nah. I think that's a thing that berserkers
got.

02:52:37.875 --> 02:52:38.966
TARVIS: Oh, really?

02:52:38.966 --> 02:52:40.265
MATT: I'll double check.

02:52:40.265 --> 02:52:42.254
TRAVIS: It might have been. Might have been some
old shit.

02:52:42.254 --> 02:52:45.232
MATT: Yeah that's mindless rage. It's sixth level
path of the berserker. It's a little Grog bleeding

02:52:45.232 --> 02:52:46.055
in there.

02:52:46.055 --> 02:52:47.566
TRAVIS: Sorry. Old shit.

02:52:47.566 --> 02:52:48.450
MATT: All good.

02:52:48.450 --> 02:52:55.960
TRAVIS: She will definitely not move any closer to
Dashilla. Where is Yasha-- she's right there.

02:52:55.960 --> 02:52:57.190
Where's Caleb?

02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:58.544
MATT: Caleb is over there.

02:52:58.544 --> 02:53:00.235
TRAVIS: Can she...?

02:53:00.235 --> 02:53:05.086
LAURA: If she stays within 15 feet of me then
she's-- anyone within 15 feet of me is protected

02:53:05.086 --> 02:53:07.361
by my unicorn dragons.

02:53:07.361 --> 02:53:10.396
TRAVIS: From what? From Scary Face?

02:53:10.396 --> 02:53:11.808
TALIESIN: From being attacked physically.

02:53:11.808 --> 02:53:14.973
LAURA: From being attacked. They get attacked if
they get near you.

02:53:14.973 --> 02:53:18.068
TRAVIS: Where is Jester standing?

02:53:18.068 --> 02:53:21.982
MATT: Jester's right here. She's technically up on
the stair right there.

02:53:21.982 --> 02:53:26.064
TRAVIS: Okay I got you. Can Yasha use her 20 feet
to move to Caleb?

02:53:26.064 --> 02:53:28.975
MATT: I'll say, for the purposes of ease there,
Jester is up on that stair there.

02:53:28.975 --> 02:53:32.826
TRAVIS: 20 feet to move to Caleb, which shouldn't
be any closer to Dashilla.

02:53:32.826 --> 02:53:35.206
MATT: Nope. Up on top of this platform or off to
the side?

02:53:35.206 --> 02:53:36.448
MARISHA: There's a platform?

02:53:36.448 --> 02:53:39.318
MATT: There's a little raised section in the
center there.

02:53:39.318 --> 02:53:46.559
TRAVIS: Sure. Platform sounds good. And she will
use her handy heal thing to pump seven points of

02:53:46.859 --> 02:53:47.768
healing into Caleb.

02:53:47.768 --> 02:53:50.787
TALIESIN: Did she get tapped in the head by the
way? Since we are running her?

02:53:50.787 --> 02:53:52.921
TRAVIS: Yasha didn't. Not that I remember.

02:53:52.921 --> 02:53:53.566
MATT: No.

02:53:53.566 --> 02:53:54.549
LAURA: I did, Fjord did, and--

02:53:54.549 --> 02:53:55.506
MATT: Caleb did.

02:53:55.506 --> 02:53:56.890
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Caleb did.

02:53:56.890 --> 02:53:57.390
TALIESIN: Fuck.

02:53:57.390 --> 02:54:01.609
TRAVIS: So Caleb gets six hit points as an action,
healing hands.

02:54:01.609 --> 02:54:03.853
LIAM: On top of seven, or six total?

02:54:03.853 --> 02:54:05.430
TRAVIS: Seven total.

02:54:05.430 --> 02:54:07.060
LIAM: Seven total. So I got that.

02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:09.337
TRAVIS: Does that bring him back to
consciousness?

02:54:09.337 --> 02:54:11.055
MATT: Yes it does.

02:54:11.055 --> 02:54:12.825
TRAVIS: Okay. Just making sure.

02:54:12.825 --> 02:54:14.460
MATT: So you're back to consciousness. You're at
seven hit points.

02:54:14.460 --> 02:54:16.116
LIAM: But Expeditious Retreat is gone.

02:54:16.116 --> 02:54:16.846
MATT: Correct.

02:54:16.846 --> 02:54:17.998
LIAM: Is Mage Armor gone?

02:54:17.998 --> 02:54:21.286
MATT: No, Mage Armor is not concentration.

02:54:21.286 --> 02:54:23.908
MATT: Correct. You're still frightened until the
end of the turn.

02:54:23.908 --> 02:54:28.715
TRAVIS: Can she use a bonus action to rage, even
though she's frightened?

02:54:29.092 --> 02:54:29.887
MATT: Yeah.

02:54:29.887 --> 02:54:31.534
TRAVIS: I know it might fall if she doesn't attack
anything or isn't attacked.

02:54:31.534 --> 02:54:32.418
MATT: Correct.

02:54:32.418 --> 02:54:33.586
TRAVIS: Okay let's do it anyway.

02:54:33.586 --> 02:54:35.294
MATT: Okay, so she goes into a rage?

02:54:35.294 --> 02:54:36.100
TRAVIS: And that's her turn.

02:54:36.100 --> 02:54:38.066
MATT: All right that ends Yasha's go. At the end
of Yasha's turn it's going to use another

02:54:38.066 --> 02:54:42.282
legendary action to use Forced Vision on you,
Fjord. I need you to go ahead and make a melee

02:54:42.282 --> 02:54:47.904
attack against Beau, as you glance around and
suddenly she's right there in front of you. And

02:54:47.904 --> 02:54:51.212
you take your falchion, swing out to try and take
her out.

02:54:51.212 --> 02:54:53.789
MARISHA: Has disadvantage, because I have Patient
Defense.

02:54:53.789 --> 02:54:55.338
MATT: Yep. So you have disadvantage on the
strike.

02:54:55.338 --> 02:54:57.150
TRAVIS: Okay, that's good.

02:54:57.150 --> 02:54:59.569
MATT: But you do have plus d4s to each of the hits
because of Bless.

02:54:59.569 --> 02:55:04.292
TRAVIS: Oh shitballs. That's at two plus eight is
ten.

02:55:04.292 --> 02:55:05.660
MATT: Plus a d4.

02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:06.720
TRAVIS: Plus a d4 is--

02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:07.721
MARISHA: He misses.

02:55:07.721 --> 02:55:09.586
TRAVIS: --is 14.

02:55:09.586 --> 02:55:10.248
MATT: Yeah.

02:55:10.248 --> 02:55:13.118
MATT: (sword whoosh) You duck out of the way.
"What the hell?"

02:55:13.118 --> 02:55:14.006
MARISHA: Dick!

02:55:14.006 --> 02:55:15.144
TRAVIS: I'm like, I don't know.

02:55:15.144 --> 02:55:17.878
MARISHA: (confused noises)

02:55:17.878 --> 02:55:26.669
MATT: All right. That ends Yasha's turn. Caleb.
You are conscious, prone, floating, sinking

02:55:26.916 --> 02:55:30.231
towards the ground as you come to consciousness as
Yasha grabs and jolts you awake.

02:55:30.231 --> 02:55:34.565
LIAM: If I crouch behind the table from where
Dashilla is, will I get half cover or something?

02:55:34.565 --> 02:55:36.849
MATT: Yeah, you'd get half cover. Yeah.

02:55:36.849 --> 02:55:39.625
LIAM: Okay. So I am going to do that and then I am
going to--

02:55:39.625 --> 02:55:41.208
MATT: Getting up from prone?

02:55:41.208 --> 02:55:46.799
LIAM: I would like to stay semi-crouched to try
and get some cover from that thing.

02:55:46.799 --> 02:55:48.151
MATT: Yeah, you can get cover.

02:55:48.151 --> 02:55:57.048
LIAM: Thank you. And I pull a twisted blackened
twig out and point it at her and cast Witch Bolt

02:55:57.048 --> 02:55:58.249
at fourth level.

02:55:58.249 --> 02:55:59.362
MARIASHA: That's cool.

02:55:59.362 --> 02:56:01.362
MATT and LAURA: At fourth level!

02:56:01.362 --> 02:56:04.324
TRAVIS: That's a fuck ton of d10s?

02:56:04.324 --> 02:56:06.362
MATT: That's 4d12.

02:56:06.362 --> 02:56:11.673
LIAM: That's a ranged spell attack, correct?

02:56:11.673 --> 02:56:16.106
MATT: Correct. So you have to roll a d20, add your
spell attack modifier.

02:56:16.106 --> 02:56:17.761
LIAM: Plus the Bless?

02:56:17.761 --> 02:56:19.017
TRAVIS AND LAURA: Yes.

02:56:19.017 --> 02:56:21.088
MATT: Yes, technically, because he was
concentrating.

02:56:21.088 --> 02:56:25.949
LIAM: Spell attack is 13, plus the Bless is a d4?

02:56:25.949 --> 02:56:26.660
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:28.019
TRAVIS: It's just four, right?

02:56:28.019 --> 02:56:29.095
TALIESIN: No, it's a d4.

02:56:29.095 --> 02:56:32.510
LIAM: It's a d4. So, 14.

02:56:32.510 --> 02:56:35.548
MATT: Her armor class is 15. I'm so sorry.

02:56:35.548 --> 02:56:37.184
LIAM: Blast it. Gone.

02:56:37.184 --> 02:56:43.822
MATT: You release the Witch Bolt and as it fires
out and arcs, in a split-second moment the eyes go

02:56:43.822 --> 02:56:48.796
wide and she darts out of the way and it impacts
the side of the stone wall. You watch as the

02:56:48.796 --> 02:56:53.275
seaweed she was clutching is burned and falls away
for a second, and behind it, you see another one

02:56:53.275 --> 02:56:55.990
of those runes. Just sitting there in the
chamber.

02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:58.514
LIAM: Them's the breaks. Them's the breaks.

02:56:58.514 --> 02:57:01.358
MATT: That's your turn. All right, back at the
top. Beau, you're up.

02:57:01.358 --> 02:57:03.265
MARISHA: Spellcasters suck!

02:57:03.265 --> 02:57:06.752
MATT: Actually, at the end of Caleb's turn...

02:57:06.752 --> 02:57:08.736
TRAVIS: How many legendary actions does she have?

02:57:08.736 --> 02:57:18.468
MATT: She has three. She's going to use her last
one. She's going to go ahead and use Shifting

02:57:18.468 --> 02:57:22.489
Speed. So she's going to move her speed without
triggering opportunity attacks.

02:57:22.554 --> 02:57:27.544
(background music)

02:57:27.544 --> 02:57:31.344
SAM: Oh, a fast swimmer! A regular Michael
Phelps!

02:57:31.562 --> 02:57:34.329
MATT: Actually she can move ten more feet, so
right there.

02:57:34.329 --> 02:57:35.415
SAM: Oh my God!

02:57:35.415 --> 02:57:36.878
TRAVIS: A 50-foot swim.

02:57:36.878 --> 02:57:41.090
MATT: Yep. As you watch, she skitters across the
wall, grabbing the seaweed and using it, almost

02:57:41.090 --> 02:57:44.865
Tarzan-like, to thrust herself forward, grabbing
onto this bit, rolling, and then swimming around

02:57:44.865 --> 02:57:49.601
and is now floating in the air, or floating in the
water, right next to where Caduceus is standing.

02:57:49.601 --> 02:57:53.366
Beau, what are you doing?

02:57:53.366 --> 02:57:57.239
MARISHA: How many feet is she?

02:57:57.239 --> 02:57:58.874
MATT: From you right now?

02:57:58.874 --> 02:58:02.436
MARISHA: Yeah. (counting)

02:58:02.436 --> 02:58:04.945
MATT: 30 feet from you.

02:58:04.945 --> 02:58:11.190
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. I'm going to dart, I'm
going to do, um...

02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:14.161
LAURA: Step of the Wind?

02:58:14.161 --> 02:58:17.473
MARISHA: Thank you. Thank you for knowing my
abilities.

02:58:17.473 --> 02:58:23.226
MATT: So you jump off the ground and swim forward,
cruising through the room, Step of the Wind you

02:58:23.226 --> 02:58:28.188
get one extra push and you land right next to
where she is.

02:58:28.188 --> 02:58:31.718
MARISHA: (strained voice) I'm going to punch her
with my fists!

02:58:31.718 --> 02:58:33.386
(laughter)

02:58:33.386 --> 02:58:34.989
MATT: Go for it!

02:58:34.989 --> 02:58:42.004
MARISHA: Just going to try and Keanu Reeves
ghost-punch her. I don't know. Punching ghosts.

02:58:42.004 --> 02:58:45.065
TRAVIS: Was that a Matrix reference?

02:58:45.065 --> 02:58:47.281
MARISHA: Well, uh, you know like the--

02:58:47.281 --> 02:58:48.217
LAURA: Go!

02:58:48.217 --> 02:58:50.249
MARISHA: Is this at disadvantage?

02:58:50.249 --> 02:58:52.497
MATT: Yes, because you are underwater still.

02:58:52.497 --> 02:58:59.089
MARISHA: That's four. Yeah, probably not. 11.

02:58:59.089 --> 02:59:02.668
MATT: The first strike, as you come forward, this
is the first time you get a really good look at

02:59:02.668 --> 02:59:07.749
the face of this terrible creature, and as soon as
you come towards, the mouth opens up and you

02:59:07.749 --> 02:59:13.796
barely hold back from the punch and that just
gives it enough time to shift out of the way and

02:59:13.796 --> 02:59:15.179
it just hits water.

02:59:15.179 --> 02:59:21.266
MARISHA: One more. Okay! 22!

02:59:21.266 --> 02:59:24.559
MATT: That hits. You know now that 15 is the armor
class.

02:59:24.559 --> 02:59:28.730
TRAVIS: Can I say, for the Hex, wisdom ability
checks-- disadvantage.

02:59:28.730 --> 02:59:30.321
MATT: Wisdom ability checks, got it.

02:59:30.321 --> 02:59:30.901
MARISHA: Nine.

02:59:30.901 --> 02:59:37.199
MATT: Nine? Nine points of damage. As the first
one misses and pulls away, you're like, "Nope!"

02:59:37.199 --> 02:59:45.508
Whack! And then right across the jaw, (cracking
sound). Cold and hard. There's a toughness to her.

02:59:45.508 --> 02:59:46.766
MARISHA: Boney.

02:59:46.766 --> 02:59:48.369
MATT: All right. Does that finish your turn,
Beau?

02:59:48.369 --> 02:59:49.181
MARISHA: Yep.

02:59:49.181 --> 02:59:50.683
MATT: All right. Caduceus and Jester, you're up.

02:59:50.683 --> 02:59:51.743
TALIESIN: You want to go?

02:59:51.743 --> 02:59:52.322
LAURA: Sure!

02:59:52.322 --> 02:59:56.144
MATT: She did technically move around and would've
passed through your 15-foot radius, by the way.

02:59:56.144 --> 02:59:57.075
LAURA: Oh!

02:59:57.075 --> 03:00:04.626
MATT: So she does have to make a wisdom saving
throw. A five plus one. Six. So that's a failure.

03:00:04.626 --> 03:00:06.752
Go ahead and roll damage for your--

03:00:06.752 --> 03:00:07.792
LAURA: Spirit Guardians?

03:00:07.792 --> 03:00:09.182
MATT: Spirit Guardians, yes.

03:00:09.182 --> 03:00:09.880
LAURA: Yay!

03:00:09.880 --> 03:00:11.700
TRAVIS: Seahorses!

03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:18.439
LAURA: Seahorse unicorns! Hold on, where's my
other-- where the fuck are my d8s?

03:00:18.439 --> 03:00:20.065
SAM: You can use mine.

03:00:20.065 --> 03:00:22.136
LAURA: (high pitched) Where'd all my d8s go!?

03:00:22.136 --> 03:00:23.204
SAM: Here's one.

03:00:23.204 --> 03:00:28.851
LAURA: There's another one. 10, 13. Radiant
damage!

03:00:28.851 --> 03:00:31.929
SAM: (sing-song) Mine rolled the best of the three
dice!

03:00:31.929 --> 03:00:42.099
MATT: Caleb and Yasha are no longer frightened of
Dashilla. Okay, 13. So you watch as she darts

03:00:42.099 --> 03:00:49.147
across the room as her legendary action. All the
floating seahorses suddenly dart up and slam into

03:00:49.147 --> 03:00:53.345
her side, but she still manages to skitter past.
All right, so now it's Jester and Caduceus' turn.

03:00:53.345 --> 03:00:56.993
Because you guys are players, I'm giving you the
initiative just before the lair action hits,

03:00:56.993 --> 03:00:59.743
because you're all on 20. Go for it.

03:00:59.743 --> 03:01:05.218
LAURA: I'm going to step forward so I'm within 15
feet of her so they can try to attack her again.

03:01:05.754 --> 03:01:07.394
MATT: On her turn? All right.

03:01:07.394 --> 03:01:08.290
SAM: Bloop.

03:01:08.290 --> 03:01:20.309
LAURA: An affected creature-- When you cast the
spell-- What?

03:01:20.309 --> 03:01:25.785
MATT: Technically the creature's movement is
halved when it moves through.

03:01:25.785 --> 03:01:28.089
LAURA: An affected creature's is halved in the
area, yes.

03:01:28.089 --> 03:01:30.686
MATT: It only barely skimmed the side, so it would
have lost five foot of movement, so we'll say that

03:01:30.686 --> 03:01:31.689
Dashilla is there.

03:01:31.689 --> 03:01:37.634
LAURA: Okay. And when the creature enters the area
for the first time on a turn or starts its turn

03:01:37.634 --> 03:01:41.606
there. So if I move towards it wouldn't it enter
the area?

03:01:41.606 --> 03:01:46.007
MATT: No, you're entering hers. She has to enter
your area. However, at the start of her turn, it triggers.

03:01:46.312 --> 03:01:51.055
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to move within 15 feet
of her and then as a bonus action I'm going to

03:01:51.055 --> 03:01:53.258
cast Spiritual Weapon at 4th-level.

03:01:53.258 --> 03:01:55.408
MATT: Ooh boy!

03:01:55.408 --> 03:01:57.684
TRAVIS: Is that the first time?

03:01:57.684 --> 03:02:03.047
LAURA: Mmhmm. So that's a little spiritual
lollipop with giant serrated blades coming out of it.

03:02:03.047 --> 03:02:04.354
MATT: So where are you putting it?

03:02:04.354 --> 03:02:08.331
LAURA: Right in front of her face.

03:02:08.331 --> 03:02:10.845
MATT: Like right here? Let her do it.

03:02:10.845 --> 03:02:12.466
LAURA: Is it okay?

03:02:12.466 --> 03:02:15.058
TALIESIN: No, yeah, no, my opinions are weird.

03:02:15.058 --> 03:02:16.561
LAURA: And it's going to attack her.

03:02:16.561 --> 03:02:18.300
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:22.919
LAURA: Whoa! That's a natural 19 so I think that
hits.

03:02:22.919 --> 03:02:24.869
MATT: Yes it does, go ahead and roll damage on
that.

03:02:24.869 --> 03:02:29.792
LAURA: Whoa! Double eights!

03:02:29.792 --> 03:02:33.445
MATT: Well you cast it at 4th-level you said,
right? That's 3d8.

03:02:33.445 --> 03:02:34.916
LAURA: Really?

03:02:34.916 --> 03:02:37.069
MATT: Because it's 2nd-level normally, each level
you put on top of that--

03:02:37.069 --> 03:02:38.882
MARISHA: You get an additional die.

03:02:38.882 --> 03:02:40.324
LAURA: Really!?

03:02:40.324 --> 03:02:45.598
MATT: Yeah, for every spell level ahead of two you
get another. So 16 plus one more d8.

03:02:45.598 --> 03:02:46.744
LAURA: Seven!

03:02:46.744 --> 03:02:50.252
MATT: All right. So that's 23.

03:02:50.252 --> 03:02:51.280
TRAVIS: 24.

03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:58.047
MATT: No, 23. Double eights is 16, plus seven is
23.

03:02:58.047 --> 03:02:59.160
LAURA: 23 plus four!

03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:05.053
MATT: Yeah, because of your wisdom. So 27 points
of damage. Whack! The serrated edge of the

03:03:05.053 --> 03:03:13.944
lollipop grinds into her! As it does, black blood
spills out from the wound of the chest, the shreds

03:03:13.944 --> 03:03:19.208
of seaweed and cloth pulling off from the front,
exposing the sunken rib cage where the flesh is

03:03:19.208 --> 03:03:25.570
pulled taut against, and now the wound itself is
open and spilling this trail of cloudy black blood

03:03:25.570 --> 03:03:26.601
in the water.

03:03:26.601 --> 03:03:29.201
LAURA: For my action, I'm going to cast Sacred
Flame.

03:03:29.201 --> 03:03:30.485
SAM: That was your bonus action?

03:03:30.485 --> 03:03:34.524
MATT: Yep. Sacred Flame is a cantrip, so go for
it. That's wisdom, or dexterity?

03:03:34.524 --> 03:03:36.014
LAURA: Dexterity save.

03:03:36.014 --> 03:03:38.700
MATT: Dexterity save. That is going to be an 18.

03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:40.307
LAURA: Damn it. Okay.

03:03:40.307 --> 03:03:41.699
MATT: But that was a nice round.

03:03:41.699 --> 03:03:43.864
TRAVIS: Dude, get the fuck out!

03:03:43.864 --> 03:03:46.722
MATT: All right, finishing up Jester's turn.
Caduceus?

03:03:46.722 --> 03:03:50.205
TALIESIN: Motherfucking dexterity save. That's
some bullshit.

03:03:50.205 --> 03:03:55.042
MATT: You just watched her dart over you,
essentially, Ten feet up above, scoot past, land,

03:03:55.042 --> 03:04:00.178
and then both Jester and Beau converge and start
pummelling her in the hallway.

03:04:00.178 --> 03:04:06.327
MARISHA: I'm just punching the shit out of her
while surrounded by rainbow sea horses and a

03:04:06.327 --> 03:04:09.986
bladed lollipop. This is awesome.

03:04:09.986 --> 03:04:12.958
MATT: Welcome to Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

03:04:12.958 --> 03:04:21.237
TALIESIN: I'm going to also do this. I'm going to
do a Sacred Flame.

03:04:21.237 --> 03:04:27.892
MATT: Okay. Dexterity save. That is going to be a
14. I don't believe that--

03:04:27.892 --> 03:04:30.001
TALIESIN: That does not, because it's a 16.

03:04:30.001 --> 03:04:33.706
MATT: Yep, so go ahead and roll damage on that.

03:04:33.706 --> 03:04:40.050
TALIESIN: And that's nine points of radiant
damage.

03:04:40.050 --> 03:04:44.239
MATT: Nine points of radiant damage, nice. (spell
impact, angry snarl)

03:04:44.239 --> 03:04:48.842
TALIESIN: I don't like the look of this thing. I'm
going to turn invisible and I'm going to back up a

03:04:48.842 --> 03:04:50.486
little into the...

03:04:50.486 --> 03:04:58.907
MATT: So you turn invisible and you're going to
back up into here, into this little corner?

03:04:58.907 --> 03:05:01.225
TALIESIN: I mean down the steps a bit.

03:05:01.225 --> 03:05:02.187
MATT: Oh, there?

03:05:02.187 --> 03:05:05.865
TALIESIN: Towards me. Oh, I got a thing still.

03:05:05.865 --> 03:05:07.088
MATT: Over here?

03:05:07.088 --> 03:05:10.321
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm far enough away from
anything that I might need to fuck with.

03:05:10.321 --> 03:05:17.141
MATT: Got it. And you are invisible there. Good to
know. All right, at the end of your turn, the lair

03:05:17.141 --> 03:05:23.787
action kicks in. Clouded Waters. Now you watch as
the silt, the muck, and the bones all of a sudden

03:05:23.787 --> 03:05:29.887
begin to swirl up into the waters around you and
obscure the area. The entire lair is now

03:05:29.887 --> 03:05:34.091
considered heavily obscured. You cannot see more
than five feet in front of you.

03:05:34.091 --> 03:05:35.228
SAM: Whoa.

03:05:35.228 --> 03:05:40.823
MATT: It's now Dashilla's turn. She gets her
legendary actions back.

03:05:40.823 --> 03:05:42.406
SAM: Hey, she can't see us!

03:05:42.496 --> 03:05:46.616
(background music)

03:05:46.646 --> 03:05:51.530
MATT: Oh, she's not affected by the obscurity.
This is her lair.

03:05:51.773 --> 03:05:53.264
TALIESIN: She starts 15 feet within--

03:05:53.264 --> 03:05:55.676
MATT: She does, so immediately she has to take the
Spirit Guardians.

03:05:55.676 --> 03:05:57.757
LAURA: And she's hexed on wisdom.

03:05:57.757 --> 03:06:02.718
MATT: Wisdom ability checks, not saving throws.
Otherwise hex would be super powerful. But she

03:06:02.718 --> 03:06:03.730
still rolls a 4.

03:06:03.730 --> 03:06:04.504
LAURA: Yay!

03:06:04.504 --> 03:06:06.168
MATT: So do full damage.

03:06:06.168 --> 03:06:09.002
LAURA: That doesn't count because it slipped out.

03:06:09.002 --> 03:06:11.130
SAM: It was not intentional.

03:06:11.130 --> 03:06:11.684
MATT: Okay.

03:06:11.684 --> 03:06:15.628
LAURA: I rolled lower anyway; I wanted to be fair.
13.

03:06:15.628 --> 03:06:24.094
MATT: 13 points of radiant damage, blasted again
as this cluster of vibrant glowing, almost pink

03:06:24.094 --> 03:06:30.085
pulsing sea horses swirl around and pierce through
her chest.

03:06:30.085 --> 03:06:31.344
LAURA: Sea horses with unicorn horns.

03:06:31.344 --> 03:06:33.400
MATT: Unicorn horns, of course. I assumed!

03:06:33.400 --> 03:06:35.326
TRAVIS: Do they have pissed off expressions or are
they happy?

03:06:35.326 --> 03:06:36.163
LAURA: They're happy.

03:06:36.163 --> 03:06:37.081
TRAVIS: Oh good!

03:06:37.081 --> 03:06:39.611
MATT: They're just like "wee!"

03:06:39.611 --> 03:06:41.521
TALIESIN: Be happy in your work.

03:06:41.521 --> 03:06:46.171
MATT: It's very like that Perry Bible Fellowship
comic.

03:06:46.171 --> 03:06:47.520
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, oh god!

03:06:47.520 --> 03:06:53.371
MATT: The kid gets impaled by the unicorns; I love
it so much. All right, so that happens. The top of

03:06:53.371 --> 03:07:00.154
her turn. Yeah, nobody's currently feared by her.

03:07:00.154 --> 03:07:03.065
TRAVIS: Yasha is still.

03:07:03.065 --> 03:07:03.838
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:07:03.838 --> 03:07:19.550
MATT: No, it lasts until the beginning of the next
combat round. Okay, she's going to go ahead and do

03:07:19.550 --> 03:07:23.545
a multi-attack with her claws against Beauregard
because she's in melee.

03:07:23.545 --> 03:07:24.644
MARISHA: Okay.

03:07:24.644 --> 03:07:31.739
MATT: That's two strikes against you, these giant
bladed, fingered claws. First one is-- that's a

03:07:31.739 --> 03:07:34.322
natural 14 plus seven. That's 21 to hit.

03:07:34.322 --> 03:07:34.945
MARISHA: Yep.

03:07:34.945 --> 03:07:37.081
MATT: The second one is a natural 16.

03:07:37.081 --> 03:07:37.764
MARISHA: Yep.

03:07:37.764 --> 03:07:45.521
MATT: All right, so you get hit from each. You
take, from the first strike, 12 points of slashing

03:07:45.521 --> 03:07:54.094
damage. The second one, 14 points of slashing
damage. In what already was clouded silt is now

03:07:54.094 --> 03:07:59.355
clouded further by your own blood from the slash
marks across the front and the side of your neck

03:07:59.355 --> 03:08:04.048
and jaw, and the pain sears through. In an
instant, all you see is the claws streaking

03:08:04.048 --> 03:08:08.351
through and the glowing yellow eyes before they
rescind back into the cloud.

03:08:08.351 --> 03:08:10.254
TALIESIN: No attack of opportunity?

03:08:10.254 --> 03:08:14.177
MATT: Well no, she's going to attempt to move
back. Make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage.

03:08:14.228 --> 03:08:17.905
MARISHA: Yeah. Nope.

03:08:17.905 --> 03:08:19.004
TRAVIS: Fucking Gil.

03:08:19.004 --> 03:08:22.221
MATT: With that she vanishes into--

03:08:22.221 --> 03:08:25.761
LIAM: The murk. It's just physical crap filling
the water?

03:08:25.761 --> 03:08:31.532
MATT: Yeah, just all over. That's going to go
ahead and end Dashilla's turn. Fjord, you're up.

03:08:31.532 --> 03:08:38.523
TRAVIS: Am I coherent? Am I awake and alive?

03:08:38.523 --> 03:08:39.248
MATT: Yes.

03:08:39.248 --> 03:08:41.079
TRAVIS: That's cool, good!

03:08:41.079 --> 03:08:43.799
MATT: You're a bit shaken by all these visions
that keep creeping into your head.

03:08:43.799 --> 03:08:48.999
TRAVIS: Wow. I only remember where I kind of last
saw her?

03:08:48.999 --> 03:08:54.104
MATT: Yes. I mean you saw her still dart and run
this way, and then everything just went dark

03:08:54.302 --> 03:08:57.209
around you and you can't see more than five feet
ahead of you.

03:08:57.209 --> 03:09:03.353
TRAVIS: Fuck me. I don't even know where to send
anything.

03:09:03.353 --> 03:09:13.520
MATT: It's heavily obscured which means you can
still attack that direction, but it's at disadvantage.

03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:19.655
TRAVIS: I'm going to move over to the throne.

03:09:19.655 --> 03:09:21.974
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:09:21.974 --> 03:09:26.494
SAM: And claim it as my own!

03:09:26.494 --> 03:09:39.226
TRAVIS: And send two Eldritch Blasts towards the
area that she's at, at disadvantage.

03:09:39.226 --> 03:09:41.035
MATT: Okay, wow, that was--

03:09:41.035 --> 03:09:43.213
TALIESIN: I feel you.

03:09:43.213 --> 03:09:44.509
LIAM: Desperation.

03:09:44.509 --> 03:09:46.720
MATT: All right. Two strikes at disadvantage, go
for it.

03:09:46.720 --> 03:09:52.649
TRAVIS: Plus the d4, that's 14. Plus three is 17.

03:09:52.649 --> 03:09:54.420
MATT: That still hits with disadvantage.

03:09:54.420 --> 03:09:58.635
TRAVIS: And a 12-- 19, 20?

03:09:58.635 --> 03:10:05.099
MATT: You watch as soon as everything clouds in
and you see her vanishing in that distant area.

03:10:05.099 --> 03:10:11.967
You throw them back out there, and through sheer
luck and remembering where she was heading, both

03:10:11.967 --> 03:10:17.503
blasts-- you don't even see the impact but you
hear the (gasp). Roll damage on each of those.

03:10:17.503 --> 03:10:21.934
LIAM: He just threw the basketball over his
shoulder from half court.

03:10:21.934 --> 03:10:27.254
TRAVIS: That's ten on the first one, and the
second one is nine plus four is 13.

03:10:27.254 --> 03:10:28.954
LAURA: He Sigourney Weavered it.

03:10:28.954 --> 03:10:32.452
TRAVIS: 16 points on the second one, so 26 total.

03:10:32.452 --> 03:10:33.141
MATT: Nice!

03:10:33.141 --> 03:10:34.791
TALIESIN: Fuck, motherfucker!

03:10:34.791 --> 03:10:37.753
MATT: Oof, there were some good rounds in that.
All right, that's your action?

03:10:37.753 --> 03:10:40.008
TRAVIS: That's Hex baby. That is my action.

03:10:40.008 --> 03:10:42.711
MATT: Okay, you're going to stay there by the
throne?

03:10:42.711 --> 03:10:43.333
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:10:43.333 --> 03:10:45.989
MATT: That finishes your go, Fjord. Next up, it is
Nott.

03:10:45.989 --> 03:10:50.450
SAM: I will follow suit-- oh wait, she's more than
30 feet away from me, isn't she?

03:10:50.450 --> 03:10:53.159
MATT: You have no idea where she is. You know that
she's somewhere in this tunnel.

03:10:53.159 --> 03:10:53.916
SAM: Okay, great.

03:10:53.916 --> 03:10:55.335
MATT: Or in that direction.

03:10:55.335 --> 03:11:03.018
SAM: Well then I won't do that. I will-- there's
nothing for me to do. There's no do to do.

03:11:03.018 --> 03:11:04.891
LAURA: You can fire at where she was.

03:11:04.891 --> 03:11:06.539
TALIESIN: Or hold action.

03:11:06.539 --> 03:11:08.771
LAURA: Or hold action until she appears, that's
smart.

03:11:08.771 --> 03:11:12.139
SAM: Yeah, I'll just find a little hiding spot
somewhere, like around--

03:11:12.139 --> 03:11:14.545
MATT: You're heavily obscured so you can literally
hide anywhere right now.

03:11:14.545 --> 03:11:15.506
SAM: Okay.

03:11:15.506 --> 03:11:18.189
MATT: You're in a cloud of murk and gathered
sediment.

03:11:18.189 --> 03:11:18.945
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:11:18.945 --> 03:11:24.207
SAM: Yeah! I'll just crouch down then and hold my
action until I see her.

03:11:24.207 --> 03:11:26.082
MATT: Are you hiding then as a bonus?

03:11:26.082 --> 03:11:26.750
SAM: Yes.

03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:28.720
MATT: Roll stealth.

03:11:28.720 --> 03:11:30.663
SAM: 18.

03:11:30.663 --> 03:11:33.535
MATT: Okay, and then you are holding--

03:11:33.535 --> 03:11:37.834
SAM: Holding a crossbow bolt until I see her or an
enemy.

03:11:37.834 --> 03:11:41.701
MATT: Okay, you got it. All right, that finishes
your go. Yasha's turn.

03:11:41.701 --> 03:11:48.768
TRAVIS: Yeah. She doesn't know where she is right?
It's clouded as fuck?

03:11:48.768 --> 03:11:49.656
MATT: Yeah.

03:11:49.656 --> 03:11:51.317
TRAVIS: She's all melee as shit.

03:11:51.317 --> 03:11:54.938
SAM: Can she dispel the magical effect on the
room? I don't know.

03:11:54.938 --> 03:11:55.806
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:11:55.806 --> 03:11:57.888
LIAM: It's not necessarily a magical effect.

03:11:57.888 --> 03:11:59.451
MARISHA: Oh, her sword!

03:11:59.451 --> 03:12:01.753
TRAVIS: Actually, she has Dispel Magic on her
sword.

03:12:01.753 --> 03:12:03.144
LIAM: If it's magic.

03:12:03.144 --> 03:12:09.426
TRAVIS: The Magician's Judge. You can choose to
cast Dispel Magic against the target as part of

03:12:09.426 --> 03:12:10.490
the attack.

03:12:10.490 --> 03:12:12.504
MARISHA: It's a lair action.

03:12:12.504 --> 03:12:15.145
TRAVIS: Can I attack the water?

03:12:15.145 --> 03:12:16.193
MATT: It's less--

03:12:16.193 --> 03:12:19.025
LIAM: That's why I asked if it was shit in the
water.

03:12:19.025 --> 03:12:23.703
MATT: Yeah, not that Yasha would understand with
her comparatively limited experience of arcane

03:12:23.703 --> 03:12:28.429
stuff, but it's not so much magical darkness than
it is as much of sediment and silt up in the air

03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:32.071
by some sort of-- it's up to her, she can give it
a shot.

03:12:32.071 --> 03:12:33.006
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:12:33.006 --> 03:12:34.284
MATT: All right.

03:12:34.284 --> 03:12:39.495
TRAVIS: No. She will put her back against Caleb,
back to back.

03:12:39.495 --> 03:12:41.124
MATT: While staying there?

03:12:41.124 --> 03:12:45.892
TRAVIS: Yeah. Get down off the pedestal, I guess.
Literally back to back with him, shoulder blades

03:12:45.892 --> 03:12:51.417
against shoulder blades, and hold her attack in
case she-bitch shows up.

03:12:51.417 --> 03:12:54.353
SAM: Just two bad-asses, back to back, ready to
go.

03:12:54.353 --> 03:12:55.493
MATT: You got it.

03:12:55.493 --> 03:12:56.502
LIAM: Where are they?

03:12:56.502 --> 03:12:57.730
TRAVIS: Her rage will fall.

03:12:57.730 --> 03:13:01.812
MATT: Yes it does. Okay, that ends Yasha's go.
Caleb.

03:13:01.812 --> 03:13:06.573
LIAM: I'm going to cast Detect Magic because I
have a suspicion that she has something on her, or

03:13:06.573 --> 03:13:12.848
perhaps the orb in her head. Then I will down the
potion that's in my pocket as a bonus action.

03:13:12.848 --> 03:13:14.353
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:13:14.353 --> 03:13:14.959
LIAM: Yeah.

03:13:14.959 --> 03:13:20.550
MATT: You cast Detect Magic in a 30 foot radius
around you. You sense a powerful magical essence

03:13:20.550 --> 03:13:22.210
from the throne next to Fjord.

03:13:22.210 --> 03:13:23.061
LIAM: Ah!

03:13:23.061 --> 03:13:25.914
SAM: Kill Fjord.

03:13:25.914 --> 03:13:40.975
LIAM: Okay, so I get six points back from that. I
am going to move towards Fjord and crouch behind

03:13:40.975 --> 03:13:42.076
the table.

03:13:42.076 --> 03:13:42.773
MATT: Right there?

03:13:42.773 --> 03:13:46.711
LIAM: A little closer this way, so I'd be between
Fjord and the table. Ja, gut.

03:13:46.711 --> 03:13:48.233
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn.

03:13:48.233 --> 03:13:50.103
LIAM: Yes. Trying to get cover again.

03:13:50.103 --> 03:13:54.194
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn,
Dashilla's going to use a legendary action to use

03:13:54.194 --> 03:14:00.033
Forced Vision on you Fjord. As you're there by the
side, you look over by the corner and you see--

03:14:00.033 --> 03:14:06.338
you don't see Caleb. You see a spirit rushing up
towards you with an open maw. Go ahead and make an attack.

03:14:06.345 --> 03:14:07.982
TRAVIS: Disadvantage?

03:14:07.982 --> 03:14:08.797
MATT: No.

03:14:08.797 --> 03:14:09.940
TRAVIS: Why was it at disadvantage before?

03:14:09.940 --> 03:14:11.362
MATT: Because she had Patient Defense on.

03:14:11.362 --> 03:14:12.270
TRAVIS: That's right.

03:14:12.270 --> 03:14:13.988
LAURA: But it's a melee attack.

03:14:13.988 --> 03:14:15.336
MARISHA: Against him?

03:14:15.336 --> 03:14:19.308
MATT: He's not affected by it because of his
armor. He's got Mariner's Armor.

03:14:19.308 --> 03:14:21.601
LIAM: So it doesn't affect just movement. It's
everything?

03:14:21.601 --> 03:14:30.807
TRAVIS: That's a natural one. Plus two! For three.
A total of ten.

03:14:30.807 --> 03:14:36.115
MATT: Yeah, no. As you swing, that little bit in
the back of your brain resists, and you can see

03:14:36.115 --> 03:14:37.815
for a moment through the illusion--

03:14:37.815 --> 03:14:40.017
TRAVIS: Sorry, 11. It's 11.

03:14:40.017 --> 03:14:42.993
MATT: With your mage armor I think you're okay,
right?

03:14:42.993 --> 03:14:44.989
LIAM: Oh yeah. 14.

03:14:44.989 --> 03:14:49.958
MATT: Yeah you manage to just pull back enough to
pull the blade back and Caleb you watch as it

03:14:49.958 --> 03:14:52.435
spins past, missing you by inches.

03:14:52.435 --> 03:14:55.085
LIAM: Ah! You were Fjord in that moment.

03:14:55.085 --> 03:14:59.837
(laughter)

03:14:59.837 --> 03:15:00.743
MATT: All right.

03:15:00.743 --> 03:15:02.484
SAM: Any excuse to hit Marisha.

03:15:02.484 --> 03:15:03.843
MARISHA: The fuck?

03:15:03.843 --> 03:15:06.142
MATT: Top of the round. It's Beau's go.

03:15:06.142 --> 03:15:14.138
MARISHA: I'm in shock still; I'm sorry. Bring back
cookies if you're going.

03:15:14.138 --> 03:15:15.157
LIAM: I'll bring back cookies.

03:15:15.157 --> 03:15:16.749
MARISHA: Bring back fucking cookies!

03:15:16.749 --> 03:15:17.422
LIAM: Sorry!

03:15:17.422 --> 03:15:18.613
SAM: Fucking cookies!

03:15:18.613 --> 03:15:19.816
MARISHA: You fucking dick!

03:15:19.816 --> 03:15:22.142
MATT: It's made of fucking cookies!

03:15:22.142 --> 03:15:25.001
MARISHA: Where is she?

03:15:25.001 --> 03:15:26.543
MATT: You don't know.

03:15:26.543 --> 03:15:28.188
MARISHA: I don't know? I don't see her?

03:15:28.188 --> 03:15:32.592
MATT: She disappeared. You're surrounded by cloud;
you can barely see Jester at the peripheral and

03:15:32.796 --> 03:15:37.655
the floating Spiritual Weapon, and you watch her
vanish into this swirling bit of murk.

03:15:37.655 --> 03:15:40.135
TALIESIN: Going to have to wait until it passes.

03:15:40.135 --> 03:15:51.790
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to hold. I'm going to
move down past on the other side of Jester a

03:15:51.790 --> 03:15:52.764
little bit.

03:15:52.764 --> 03:15:53.612
MATT: Okay.

03:15:53.612 --> 03:16:02.050
MARISHA: Right behind her and hold my action until
I see her, if she's in range to attack.

03:16:02.050 --> 03:16:07.006
MATT: You got it. All right, so you're holding
your attack action. That ends your turn. Caduceus

03:16:07.006 --> 03:16:07.909
and Jester.

03:16:07.909 --> 03:16:10.137
MARISHA: I have to spend bonus actions on my turn,
correct?

03:16:10.137 --> 03:16:10.969
MATT: Correct.

03:16:10.969 --> 03:16:13.081
MARISHA: I will go ahead and spend Patient
Defense.

03:16:13.081 --> 03:16:14.577
MATT: You got it.

03:16:14.577 --> 03:16:15.587
TRAVIS: PD!

03:16:15.587 --> 03:16:21.097
LAURA: (low-pitched siren-like sound, then
high-pitched siren-like sound) You go first.

03:16:21.097 --> 03:16:24.774
TALIESIN: I'm not particularly interesting. I'm
just going to--

03:16:24.774 --> 03:16:26.068
MATT: You reappear.

03:16:26.068 --> 03:16:36.368
TALIESIN: I reappear. I'm going to move a little
further into the center of the room, and I'm going

03:16:36.368 --> 03:16:37.578
to--

03:16:37.578 --> 03:16:38.409
MATT: There?

03:16:38.409 --> 03:16:43.745
TALIESIN: No, a little-- I've got a pen for this.
Oh my god, it's dead now. To be fair, we've been

03:16:43.745 --> 03:16:46.555
using it for years. Just at the foot of the
stairs.

03:16:46.555 --> 03:16:47.718
MATT: Oh, like here?

03:16:47.718 --> 03:16:51.770
TALIESIN: Yeah, like there. We'll make a nice long
line so it'll be a little touchy-feely thing to

03:16:51.770 --> 03:17:00.358
get from one side to the other. I'm going to hold
my attack until I see her, which is going to be a

03:17:00.358 --> 03:17:01.809
Sacred Flame.

03:17:01.809 --> 03:17:04.193
MATT: Okay, so you're holding Sacred Flame.

03:17:04.193 --> 03:17:18.589
TALIESIN: As a bonus, I'm going to do Healing Word
on-- you are probably pretty down, so I will throw

03:17:18.589 --> 03:17:22.310
you a tiny bit-- it's not a lot, but it's nine
points.

03:17:22.310 --> 03:17:24.141
LAURA: Ooh, that's pretty good.

03:17:24.141 --> 03:17:26.388
MARISHA: Ooh, that is good.

03:17:26.388 --> 03:17:27.160
SAM: Ooh!

03:17:27.160 --> 03:17:34.835
MATT: Okay. All right, so you're holding Sacred
Flame, you said, right?

03:17:34.835 --> 03:17:35.757
LAURA: No, that's--

03:17:35.757 --> 03:17:37.076
TALIESIN: That was me.

03:17:37.076 --> 03:17:38.382
MATT: What are you doing, Jester?

03:17:38.382 --> 03:17:45.404
LAURA: I guess I'll just for my bonus action-- can
I swing my lollipop at where I thought she was?

03:17:45.404 --> 03:17:48.641
MATT: Sure, go ahead and roll attack with
disadvantage.

03:17:48.641 --> 03:17:52.870
LAURA: Natural 20 and a 16.

03:17:52.870 --> 03:17:56.360
MATT: It hits the fuck out of nothing; she's not
there, unfortunately.

03:17:56.360 --> 03:18:08.049
LAURA: Damn it. Okay, then I guess I will hold my
spell Guiding Bolt until I see her.

03:18:08.049 --> 03:18:19.919
MATT: Okay. At the end of the turn, the sediment
drops. The moment it drops, she appears.

03:18:19.919 --> 03:18:20.812
SAM: Hey!

03:18:20.812 --> 03:18:22.742
MARISHA: Be at range, bitch!

03:18:22.742 --> 03:18:24.339
MATT: She is over here.

03:18:24.339 --> 03:18:25.846
MARISHA: She's on fucking range!

03:18:25.846 --> 03:18:30.099
MATT: Nope, but both of you get to fire at her.
You unfortunately do not see her; she's around the

03:18:30.099 --> 03:18:31.518
corner from you.

03:18:31.518 --> 03:18:34.929
SAM: That's fine. I see them firing and so I just
shoot at them.

03:18:34.929 --> 03:18:38.623
MATT: So excited in the moment!

03:18:38.623 --> 03:18:40.118
SAM: Ahh!

03:18:40.118 --> 03:18:41.268
TRAVIS: Light it up!

03:18:41.268 --> 03:18:42.742
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:18:42.742 --> 03:18:46.303
MATT: That's amazing! All right, so roll your
damage.

03:18:46.303 --> 03:18:48.433
LAURA: 4d6 times two?

03:18:48.433 --> 03:18:49.012
MATT: Yep.

03:18:49.012 --> 03:18:51.267
TALIESIN: And save against dex 16.

03:18:51.267 --> 03:18:53.396
MATT: Natural 19.

03:18:53.396 --> 03:18:54.792
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

03:18:54.792 --> 03:18:56.089
SAM: Ooh, nice!

03:18:56.089 --> 03:18:58.059
TALIESIN: Yeah, all I need.

03:18:58.059 --> 03:19:04.890
LAURA: 32 points of radiant damage and next is
advantage.

03:19:04.890 --> 03:19:08.750
MATT: Next attack has advantage on her, yeah.
She's starting to look pretty hurt. As it blasts

03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:14.352
into her and lights up the vicinity, between the
gash and the various impacts from the Eldritch

03:19:14.352 --> 03:19:19.362
Blasts and the punches from Beau, and now where
that impacted, there's now a darkened, burned

03:19:19.362 --> 03:19:26.615
crater in the center of the chest that's beginning
to ooze out blood. She's like (heavy breathing).

03:19:26.615 --> 03:19:35.494
All right. Reappears, at which point, the next
lair action is going to be Tethering Walls. Any

03:19:35.494 --> 03:19:39.833
creature within ten feet of a wall must make a
dexterity saving throw. That's going to be Jester,

03:19:39.833 --> 03:19:46.436
Beau's just out of range, Caduceus. Everybody but
Jester, ten feet from a wall.

03:19:46.436 --> 03:19:49.388
LAURA: Everybody but me?

03:19:49.388 --> 03:19:53.451
MATT: Yeah. No, sorry, everybody but Beau. Beau's
the one who's central to this chamber.

03:19:53.451 --> 03:19:55.425
TRAVIS: Yasha has advantage on those.

03:19:55.425 --> 03:19:57.304
MATT: She does. What's up?

03:19:57.304 --> 03:20:01.315
TALIESIN: You've got a d4 on saves also. Dex
save?

03:20:01.315 --> 03:20:03.180
MATT: Dex save, yes.

03:20:03.180 --> 03:20:04.096
LAURA: 22.

03:20:04.096 --> 03:20:05.498
MATT: Success.

03:20:05.498 --> 03:20:09.024
TRAVIS: Natural 20 for Fjord and a 19 for Yasha.

03:20:09.024 --> 03:20:10.629
MATT: Great, success.

03:20:10.629 --> 03:20:12.105
MARISHA: Didn't have to roll.

03:20:12.105 --> 03:20:13.197
MATT: I'm sorry, not you.

03:20:13.197 --> 03:20:13.746
LIAM: 14.

03:20:13.746 --> 03:20:14.509
MATT: Success.

03:20:14.509 --> 03:20:15.188
SAM: 21.

03:20:15.188 --> 03:20:15.927
MATT: Success.

03:20:15.927 --> 03:20:16.672
TALIESIN: Six.

03:20:16.672 --> 03:20:22.475
MATT: Caduceus, as the seaweed extends outward,
most of you manage to duck out of the way.

03:20:22.475 --> 03:20:31.530
However, it wraps around and pulls Caduceus to the
wall. You are grappled and you take 11 points of

03:20:31.530 --> 03:20:32.554
poison damage.

03:20:32.554 --> 03:20:34.000
TALIESIN: All right.

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:50.318
MATT: That ends that. It is now Dashilla's turn.
Dashilla is going to go ahead and move ten feet up

03:20:50.318 --> 03:20:51.379
to Jester.

03:20:51.379 --> 03:20:53.833
LAURA: She has to make a saving throw.

03:20:53.833 --> 03:20:55.135
SAM: I shoot her.

03:20:55.135 --> 03:20:58.646
MATT: Well, she actually started within the range,
so she makes it. You do.

03:20:58.646 --> 03:21:00.180
LAURA: She started within 15 feet?

03:21:00.180 --> 03:21:03.038
MATT: You do. Go ahead and make your attack.

03:21:03.038 --> 03:21:05.214
SAM: It's a 16.

03:21:05.214 --> 03:21:06.340
MATT: 16 hits.

03:21:06.340 --> 03:21:09.949
SAM: I am hidden from her.

03:21:09.949 --> 03:21:11.205
MATT: Correct.

03:21:11.205 --> 03:21:12.798
TRAVIS: Sneak attack?

03:21:12.798 --> 03:21:17.840
SAM: Uh-huh. 20.

03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:24.315
MATT: 20 points of damage, oof. Nice. Then the
save against yours, a natural 19. So she takes

03:21:24.315 --> 03:21:25.979
half damage. Still roll.

03:21:25.979 --> 03:21:36.662
LAURA: Okay, so I still roll. Oh, that's a seven.
No, that's a one. Okay. Oh, that's shit. Five. It

03:21:36.662 --> 03:21:38.103
looks like a seven.

03:21:38.103 --> 03:21:40.808
SAM: It does. It's not a good dice. You should
throw that one away.

03:21:40.808 --> 03:21:47.320
MATT: Five points of damage, reduced to two. She's
going to rush toward you and take two claw strikes

03:21:47.320 --> 03:21:56.143
at you. Natural 19! Wow, fucking 19s this past
round. Yeah, that's a 26 to hit you.

03:21:56.143 --> 03:21:57.492
LAURA: It hits.

03:21:57.492 --> 03:21:59.469
MATT: On the second strike, a natural 17.

03:21:59.469 --> 03:22:00.854
LAURA: That also hits.

03:22:00.854 --> 03:22:09.671
MATT: Yep, they both hit you. You take, ooh, 19
points of slashing damage from the first hit and

03:22:09.671 --> 03:22:11.665
17 points of slashing damage from the second.

03:22:11.665 --> 03:22:15.515
LAURA and TALIESIN: Damn.

03:22:15.515 --> 03:22:19.090
MATT: That's ten feet of movement, and she's going
to--

03:22:19.090 --> 03:22:21.089
LAURA: Oh, I use Hellish Rebuke!

03:22:21.089 --> 03:22:22.898
MATT: Go for it.

03:22:22.898 --> 03:22:30.594
TRAVIS: You could hear the thought burst forth:
Don't forget about it!

03:22:30.594 --> 03:22:35.681
LAURA: 15 points.

03:22:35.681 --> 03:22:40.294
MATT: Nice! Dashilla's looking really bad.

03:22:40.294 --> 03:22:47.058
LAURA: As she hits me, my eyes flare white, and I
go: Aah! Like that.

03:22:47.058 --> 03:22:53.090
MATT: As it happens, these ice crystals formulate
out of the seawater and all cross-jettison into

03:22:53.090 --> 03:23:01.189
her body. Now they're embedded in her chest and
torso, these large crystals of shards of jagged

03:23:01.189 --> 03:23:06.248
ice. (snarling) Eyes going wide, looks around.
She's going to use the rest of her movement--

03:23:06.248 --> 03:23:07.898
TALIESIN: Speed is halved.

03:23:07.898 --> 03:23:18.878
MATT: Speed is halved on the movement, so that's
(counting) 60.

03:23:18.878 --> 03:23:20.500
LAURA: Oh, shit balls.

03:23:20.500 --> 03:23:24.988
MATT: Well, not 50, technically, because 50 is her
swimming speed. So right there.

03:23:24.988 --> 03:23:27.157
SAM and LAURA: She's fleeing.

03:23:27.157 --> 03:23:29.769
MATT: That's the end of Dashilla's turn. Fjord,
you're up first.

03:23:29.769 --> 03:23:32.992
SAM: Teleport! I don't know, can't you teleport or
something?

03:23:32.992 --> 03:23:34.361
MARISHA: Is she trying to run?

03:23:34.361 --> 03:23:38.019
TALIESIN: Technically, I think you have line of
sight, from what I'm looking at right now.

03:23:38.019 --> 03:23:39.859
LAURA: If you jump up, you do.

03:23:39.859 --> 03:23:45.338
MATT: Yeah. It is water. There is a vertical
aspect you guys can use if you want to.

03:23:45.338 --> 03:23:48.114
TRAVIS: Why not. I'll go, (impacts).

03:23:48.114 --> 03:23:55.540
MATT: Okay. There's this cloud of sand and dust
and bones that get scattered up from your leap.

03:23:55.540 --> 03:23:59.152
You're up in the air and then throw both forward.
Roll attacks.

03:23:59.152 --> 03:24:05.332
MARISHA: Kill her. Come on. That's good!

03:24:05.332 --> 03:24:08.225
TRAVIS: That's a 26 and a 23.

03:24:08.225 --> 03:24:10.299
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

03:24:10.299 --> 03:24:17.831
TRAVIS: Okay, so 12, 15 points on the first one.

03:24:17.831 --> 03:24:20.380
LAURA: Did you add your--? Okay.

03:24:20.380 --> 03:24:26.612
TRAVIS: Nine points on the second one, so 19
points of damage.

03:24:26.612 --> 03:24:28.628
MATT: 19 points on the second one?

03:24:28.628 --> 03:24:31.681
TRAVIS: No, 19 points total between the two.

03:24:31.681 --> 03:24:38.789
MATT: Okay. Fuck, man, she's right on the cusp!
All right. That finishes your turn?

03:24:38.789 --> 03:24:39.961
TRAVIS: It does.

03:24:39.961 --> 03:24:43.233
MATT: Legendary action, she's going to Shifting
Speed--

03:24:43.233 --> 03:24:44.395
TALIESIN: Damn it!

03:24:44.395 --> 03:24:45.708
LAURA and TALIESIN: No!

03:24:45.708 --> 03:24:47.224
MATT: 20, and is out of sight.

03:24:47.224 --> 03:24:48.280
MARISHA: No!

03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:51.730
TALIESIN: You still know where she is because of
Hex, though, right?

03:24:51.730 --> 03:24:57.265
MATT: Hex doesn't work that way. That's Hunter's
Mark. All right, that finishes Fjord's turn. Nott?

03:24:57.265 --> 03:24:59.562
MARISHA: Go fight her!

03:24:59.562 --> 03:25:05.959
SAM: I'll run after her, but it's half speed, so
I'll get 45 feet.

03:25:05.959 --> 03:25:14.058
MATT: (mini clicking on map)
You still don't see her.

03:25:14.058 --> 03:25:20.453
SAM: I don't see her! That's it.

03:25:20.724 --> 03:25:22.621
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Yasha?

03:25:22.621 --> 03:25:24.175
LAURA: Can you hold until you--?

03:25:24.175 --> 03:25:27.157
MATT: He used action, movement, and bonus.

03:25:27.157 --> 03:25:30.380
TALIESIN: Who's up?

03:25:30.380 --> 03:25:32.345
MATT: It is now Yasha.

03:25:32.345 --> 03:25:33.768
TRAVIS: Oh, right, that's me. Fuck.

03:25:33.768 --> 03:25:35.752
LAURA: Cad's still grappled.

03:25:35.752 --> 03:25:36.613
TALIESIN: Help.

03:25:36.613 --> 03:25:43.244
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. She'll go through and take some
swipes at the kelp, trying to loosen Caduceus. Or

03:25:43.244 --> 03:25:45.862
would it be better to grab you and fucking pull?

03:25:45.862 --> 03:25:49.694
MATT: If she rages in advance, she can use
advantage on the athletics check. Up to you.

03:25:49.694 --> 03:25:51.759
TRAVIS: (German accent) Ja, let's do the raging.

03:25:51.759 --> 03:25:53.953
SAM: Ashley?

03:25:53.953 --> 03:25:58.570
TRAVIS: Okay. So two athletics, you said?

03:25:58.570 --> 03:26:00.390
MATT: Yes. Athletics with advantage.

03:26:00.390 --> 03:26:04.729
TRAVIS: Fucking what? 14.

03:26:04.729 --> 03:26:08.026
MATT: 14's enough. The DC to break is 12.

03:26:08.026 --> 03:26:09.607
TRAVIS: I don't know the scale, Matt.

03:26:09.607 --> 03:26:16.225
MATT: It's seaweed. But yeah. She reaches forward
and grabs Caduceus and pulls him away from the

03:26:16.406 --> 03:26:18.103
side so now you're no longer grappled. You can
move.

03:26:18.103 --> 03:26:19.462
TALIESIN: Yay! Thank you.

03:26:19.462 --> 03:26:20.138
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:26:20.138 --> 03:26:22.651
MATT: That's her action and her bonus. That
finishes Yasha's go. Caleb, you're up.

03:26:22.651 --> 03:26:33.585
LIAM: Yeah, this is a fucked situation. I am going
to hold Magic Missile at second level if she appears.

03:26:33.585 --> 03:26:34.871
MATT: You got it.

03:26:34.871 --> 03:26:36.222
LIAM: Just in case.

03:26:36.222 --> 03:26:40.091
MATT: Okay. That finishes Caleb's go. Top of the
round, Beau.

03:26:40.091 --> 03:26:46.329
MARISHA: I am burning a Step of the Wind and I am
hauling ass towards the direction that Nott ran. I

03:26:46.329 --> 03:26:49.965
have 135 feet movement speed with that, so that,
halved.

03:26:49.965 --> 03:26:51.942
MATT: Halved, yeah.

03:26:51.942 --> 03:26:53.284
SAM: So 60?

03:26:53.284 --> 03:26:54.879
LIAM: That's pitiful.

03:26:54.879 --> 03:27:02.573
MATT: You can move four squares per go, so another
(counting) four. You get out the side and you can see--

03:27:02.598 --> 03:27:03.679
LIAM: Oh, get her!

03:27:03.679 --> 03:27:05.328
MATT: She hasn't had a chance to hide yet.

03:27:05.328 --> 03:27:06.707
MARISHA: (excited yelling)

03:27:06.707 --> 03:27:08.386
LIAM: Shuriken!

03:27:08.386 --> 03:27:12.576
MARISHA: God, I wish I had something that would--
I just see her though.

03:27:12.576 --> 03:27:13.623
MATT: You see her right there.

03:27:13.623 --> 03:27:14.868
LAURA: You can't attack her? You can't--

03:27:14.868 --> 03:27:17.068
LIAM: You're right there. She probably busted
everything to get there.

03:27:17.068 --> 03:27:18.855
LAURA: Throw a shuriken.

03:27:18.855 --> 03:27:20.377
MATT: That the end of your turn?

03:27:20.377 --> 03:27:22.886
MARISHA: I don't think I have anything else.

03:27:22.886 --> 03:27:23.909
MATT: End of your turn.

03:27:23.909 --> 03:27:25.689
MARISHA: I just go: I see her!

03:27:25.689 --> 03:27:30.085
MATT: Legendary action. She's going to go ahead
and Shift Speed again. Looks over the corner and

03:27:30.085 --> 03:27:35.738
sees you (hissing) and goes ahead and darts out of
sight once more.

03:27:35.738 --> 03:27:36.702
MARISHA: Fuck.

03:27:36.702 --> 03:27:39.635
MATT: You know the direction where she curved
around though.

03:27:39.635 --> 03:27:40.576
MARISHA: Okay.

03:27:40.576 --> 03:27:45.192
MATT: That finishes your go. Caduceus and Jester.

03:27:45.192 --> 03:27:48.034
LAURA: I-- oof.

03:27:48.034 --> 03:27:54.697
TALIESIN: I'm just going to do the-- Fjord, you
should probably get what we're looking for and get

03:27:54.697 --> 03:28:01.685
after her. I'm going to hightail it towards where
she was heading.

03:28:01.685 --> 03:28:02.716
MATT: Okay.

03:28:02.716 --> 03:28:04.828
SAM: But the throne!

03:28:04.828 --> 03:28:07.499
MATT: That's as close as you can get right there,
I'll say.

03:28:07.499 --> 03:28:09.301
TALIESIN: Including burning an action?

03:28:09.301 --> 03:28:11.874
MATT: Oh, with burning an action you can get
there.

03:28:11.874 --> 03:28:12.947
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:28:12.947 --> 03:28:14.047
MATT: Okay.

03:28:14.047 --> 03:28:16.940
TALIESIN: Still have a reaction.

03:28:16.940 --> 03:28:18.221
MATT: There you go.

03:28:18.221 --> 03:28:21.970
TALIESIN: I can take a little more damage before
I'm awful.

03:28:21.970 --> 03:28:24.409
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go.

03:28:24.409 --> 03:28:31.553
LAURA: I turn to Fjord; I go: The orb! Fjord, do
you see the orb? Do I see the orb?

03:28:31.960 --> 03:28:34.095
MATT: You do not see the orb, no.

03:28:34.095 --> 03:28:42.684
LAURA: I'm going to stay here. No, I'm going to go
after everybody else.

03:28:42.684 --> 03:28:43.934
MATT: Okay.

03:28:43.934 --> 03:28:45.891
SAM: But Oskar.

03:28:45.891 --> 03:28:48.520
MATT: That a double move?

03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:50.901
LAURA: No, I'm going to cast--

03:28:50.901 --> 03:28:54.632
MATT: That's as far as you can get on your single
move there.

03:28:54.632 --> 03:28:58.565
LAURA: Has anybody-- has Nott been hit at all?

03:28:58.565 --> 03:29:00.181
TALIESIN: No.

03:29:00.181 --> 03:29:01.958
SAM: Nott's never hit.

03:29:01.958 --> 03:29:04.703
LAURA: Can I bonus action?

03:29:04.703 --> 03:29:06.280
MATT: Rogues, man.

03:29:06.280 --> 03:29:09.237
LAURA: Can I bonus action and still get the Dash
thing?

03:29:09.237 --> 03:29:11.018
MATT: Yeah because it's your action to move.

03:29:11.018 --> 03:29:17.832
LAURA: Okay, cool. Then for my bonus action I'm
going to-- oh right, the Spiritual Weapon. I was

03:29:17.832 --> 03:29:22.498
going to cast Mass Healing Word, but that's a
third level.

03:29:22.498 --> 03:29:24.253
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can't do that, no.

03:29:24.253 --> 03:29:29.180
LAURA: Never mind. Yeah, I'll bring my Spiritual
Weapon with me and then I guess I'll keep going.

03:29:29.180 --> 03:29:34.373
MATT: Right there, all right. You move (counting)
20; you get up to the edge there. Well,

03:29:34.373 --> 03:29:40.899
technically 15; you only move 30. All right, that
finishes Jester's turn. All of the seaweed falls

03:29:40.899 --> 03:29:45.514
back into a casual place. The next lair action is
going to be the Lament of the Dead.

03:29:45.514 --> 03:29:46.901
MARISHA: What?

03:29:46.901 --> 03:29:52.312
MATT: The dead spirits now begin to fall through
at different angles out of the sides of the walls

03:29:52.312 --> 03:29:56.228
and drifting through. Everybody once more needs to
make a wisdom saving throw.

03:29:56.228 --> 03:29:57.906
LAURA: Everybody?

03:29:57.906 --> 03:29:59.208
MATT: Everybody.

03:29:59.208 --> 03:30:01.458
TALIESIN: Oh, remember your extra d4. I forgot
them.

03:30:01.458 --> 03:30:04.120
MATT: Through the halls, through everything.

03:30:04.120 --> 03:30:04.755
MARISHA: 15.

03:30:04.755 --> 03:30:05.547
MATT: Success.

03:30:05.547 --> 03:30:06.255
LIAM: 14.

03:30:06.255 --> 03:30:07.081
MATT: Success.

03:30:07.081 --> 03:30:07.719
LIAM: Ooh.

03:30:07.719 --> 03:30:09.459
LAURA: This is a wisdom?

03:30:09.459 --> 03:30:11.847
MATT: Yes. DC is 12 on this.

03:30:11.847 --> 03:30:14.179
TRAVIS: 16 and a 13 for Yasha.

03:30:14.179 --> 03:30:15.235
MATT: Both successes.

03:30:15.235 --> 03:30:15.897
TALIESIN: 19.

03:30:15.897 --> 03:30:16.640
MATT: Success.

03:30:16.640 --> 03:30:17.347
LAURA: 17.

03:30:17.347 --> 03:30:18.082
MATT: Success.

03:30:18.082 --> 03:30:19.530
SAM: 11, doesn't matter.

03:30:19.530 --> 03:30:20.370
MATT: Huh?

03:30:20.370 --> 03:30:21.398
SAM: 11.

03:30:21.398 --> 03:30:22.603
LAURA: Oh, that's right, you're--

03:30:22.603 --> 03:30:25.222
MATT: Yeah, wow. You guys all cleared that check.
Nice.

03:30:25.222 --> 03:30:26.362
LIAM: Fuck you, ghost.

03:30:26.616 --> 03:30:28.509
MATT: Lair action, no effect. All right.

03:30:28.509 --> 03:30:29.595
SAM: Sorry, Matt.

03:30:29.595 --> 03:30:31.295
MATT: No, don't apologize.

03:30:31.295 --> 03:30:32.435
SAM: (whispering) He hates us.

03:30:32.435 --> 03:30:40.845
MATT: Dashilla's turn. Dashilla's somewhere.
Fjord, what do you do?

03:30:40.845 --> 03:30:48.772
TRAVIS: I'm going to turn with the falchion in my
hand and search the throne for--

03:30:48.772 --> 03:30:50.149
MATT: Make a search action?

03:30:50.149 --> 03:30:50.696
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:30:50.696 --> 03:30:53.644
MATT: Make an investigation check for me. I'll say
with advantage because you have the falchion

03:30:53.644 --> 03:30:57.213
drawn. You can sense the presence of something
important.

03:30:57.213 --> 03:30:58.914
TRAVIS: Is it investigation?

03:30:58.914 --> 03:30:59.559
MATT: Correct.

03:30:59.559 --> 03:31:01.816
SAM: Come on.

03:31:01.816 --> 03:31:02.783
TRAVIS: 13.

03:31:02.783 --> 03:31:11.670
MATT: 13 will do it. Going to the throne and
sensing with the sword like a homing beacon, you

03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:17.785
feel the strong source where the cushion in the
front of the throne is. It's partially rotted, and

03:31:17.785 --> 03:31:24.948
you can see where once was red, nice velvet
materials has blackened over time and general

03:31:24.948 --> 03:31:29.990
sediment in the area, and then minerals, begin to
gather at the corners. You reach down and tear

03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:34.672
across the front and pull it open, and as you do,
there immediately glowing from underneath, you see

03:31:34.672 --> 03:31:39.641
the yellow sphere giving off a faint aura of
light.

03:31:39.641 --> 03:31:42.523
TRAVIS: Can I reach for it?

03:31:42.523 --> 03:31:45.968
MATT: I'll let you do that, yeah.

03:31:45.968 --> 03:31:47.186
TRAVIS: I take it.

03:31:47.186 --> 03:31:48.331
MATT: You take it.

03:31:48.331 --> 03:31:50.128
SAM: Put it in your belly!

03:31:50.128 --> 03:31:53.084
LAURA: Eat it! Put it in your butt!

03:31:53.084 --> 03:31:56.033
TRAVIS: Can I do anything else with it?

03:31:56.033 --> 03:32:08.375
MATT: I'll say, for the time being there is no
immediate threat. Dashilla has fled. You can

03:32:08.375 --> 03:32:10.227
continue to search for her, if you'd like.

03:32:10.551 --> 03:32:13.986
LAURA: No, I want to go back and get that money
that she's got. No?

03:32:13.986 --> 03:32:17.808
MATT: Okay, but for the time being, Dashilla has
not-- at least, for the time being.

03:32:17.808 --> 03:32:20.260
TALIESIN: I'd rather not have this.

03:32:20.260 --> 03:32:23.346
LIAM: So my held Magic Missile fizzles because
time passes, right?

03:32:23.346 --> 03:32:24.283
MATT: It does.

03:32:24.283 --> 03:32:28.581
MARISHA: I don't know that yet, I'm going to keep
looking for her over here.

03:32:28.581 --> 03:32:31.212
MATT: Okay. You continue to move into the next
area.

03:32:31.212 --> 03:32:37.103
TALIESIN: I don't feel okay with you being alone.

03:32:37.103 --> 03:32:39.923
MARISHA: I'm hauling ass.

03:32:39.923 --> 03:32:41.985
SAM: I'm still going with her.

03:32:41.985 --> 03:32:47.349
MATT: You scoot around the area. Beau, you start
moving through in this vicinity.

03:32:47.349 --> 03:32:49.625
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, looking for anything.

03:32:49.625 --> 03:32:51.202
MATT: Nott, you doing the same?

03:32:51.202 --> 03:32:51.756
SAM: Mm-hmm.

03:32:51.756 --> 03:32:53.622
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the same.

03:32:53.622 --> 03:32:56.661
MATT: Nott, you're not as fast as her, so you're
falling a bit behind. Actually, no, you can do all

03:32:56.661 --> 03:33:00.224
three with your bonus action. Well, you both can,
just in case you want to spend ki points.

03:33:00.746 --> 03:33:02.223
MARISHA: Nah, not now.

03:33:02.223 --> 03:33:04.846
LIAM: I have a question to you, when you've done
that.

03:33:04.846 --> 03:33:05.366
MATT: Yes?

03:33:05.366 --> 03:33:11.069
LIAM: Back in the chamber, Detect Magic is still
up. Does Caleb see anything with an arcane glow in

03:33:11.069 --> 03:33:13.341
this room other than what Fjord picked up?

03:33:13.341 --> 03:33:16.455
MATT: Only the aura from the table.

03:33:16.455 --> 03:33:25.641
LIAM: So none of the shit around the edges, okay.
I guess I will start studying the runes on the

03:33:25.641 --> 03:33:31.067
walls to see how they contribute to this mystery.

03:33:31.067 --> 03:33:33.146
MATT: Okay, make an arcana check.

03:33:33.146 --> 03:33:38.033
LIAM: This gets the d4?

03:33:38.033 --> 03:33:41.256
TALIESIN: Checks, no. Saves and attacks.

03:33:41.256 --> 03:33:42.201
LIAM: 14.

03:33:42.201 --> 03:33:53.494
MATT: It's hard to pick up the details of these
particular runes. They seem of a similar age as

03:33:53.494 --> 03:34:03.195
the ones you saw on the table, but it's not the same
enchantment. You pick up that they are placed

03:34:03.195 --> 03:34:07.742
there for some reason, but you're unable to
ascertain what it is, unfortunately.

03:34:07.742 --> 03:34:17.305
LIAM: On a whim, I'm going to use a 2nd-level
spell slot to cast Comprehend Language instantly

03:34:17.305 --> 03:34:22.569
to see if anything becomes clearer, and I have to
touch the table and touch the walls to do that.

03:34:22.569 --> 03:34:30.331
MATT: Right, okay. It is not a language, per se.
These aren't passages or language being

03:34:30.331 --> 03:34:34.616
transmitted; these are runes of some kind.
They are used to channel something.

03:34:34.616 --> 03:34:39.984
They may or may not be connected to the
table altar in the center.

03:34:39.984 --> 03:34:42.880
LIAM: What are we doing here, Fjord?

03:34:42.880 --> 03:34:47.247
TRAVIS: Can I hold up the sphere in one hand and
the falchion in the other?

03:34:47.247 --> 03:34:48.225
MATT: Yeah.

03:34:48.225 --> 03:34:50.019
TRAVIS: Do they react to each other?

03:34:50.019 --> 03:34:52.191
MATT: They both get brighter.

03:34:52.191 --> 03:34:56.500
TRAVIS: Can I try and hold the sphere to my
chest?

03:34:56.500 --> 03:35:06.141
MATT: Yes, you may. As you take the sphere and
press it to your chest, your eyes suddenly flash

03:35:06.141 --> 03:35:18.023
images of black, sub-ocean darkness, the same
place your dreams have brought you over and over again, and

03:35:18.023 --> 03:35:26.823
that bright yellow light emerges, breaking the
shadow, and there you see the yellow eye with two

03:35:26.823 --> 03:35:35.179
more on the sides of it. You see the endless row
of teeth that curves into the smile-- and the

03:35:35.179 --> 03:35:42.216
flash is gone, and you look down and your hand is
empty. The rest of you watched this thing

03:35:42.216 --> 03:35:52.927
momentarily seem to become either ethereal or it
is absorbed into Fjord's chest. You look at the

03:35:52.927 --> 03:35:56.615
sword, and now there's the eye in the hilt and the
eye in the pommel.

03:35:56.615 --> 03:35:59.344
LAURA: That's tight!

03:35:59.344 --> 03:36:09.326
TRAVIS: Ooh, hotness! Mmm. Let's kill this bitch
and get the fuck out of here.

03:36:09.326 --> 03:36:12.277
LAURA: Do we need to kill her? You have what you
came for.

03:36:12.277 --> 03:36:16.270
TRAVIS: Sure, we can let her go.

03:36:16.270 --> 03:36:18.582
LIAM: We should go, she's not going to follow us
to the surface.

03:36:18.582 --> 03:36:22.990
LAURA: Let's get some platinum before we leave
though, what, what?

03:36:22.990 --> 03:36:27.367
TRAVIS: This pedestal, are we going to just leave
it?

03:36:27.367 --> 03:36:30.837
LAURA: What difference does it make?

03:36:30.837 --> 03:36:33.000
LIAM: What are your goals? Your goal is, what,
to--?

03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:36.347
TRAVIS: I was only curious about the orb, but it
just seems so--

03:36:36.347 --> 03:36:41.572
LIAM: You know what Avantika talked about, you
know what she wanted. You think this has nothing

03:36:41.572 --> 03:36:43.264
to do with that?

03:36:43.264 --> 03:36:50.653
TRAVIS: The temple I was in before had a recessed
spot for the sphere. That just seems like a rune

03:36:50.653 --> 03:36:52.355
right, like a symbol?

03:36:52.355 --> 03:37:01.556
LIAM: Yeah, but if that was some sort of lock, you
want to put the key in that lock?

03:37:01.556 --> 03:37:02.401
TRAVIS: No.

03:37:02.401 --> 03:37:05.124
LIAM: Do you feel any different?

03:37:05.124 --> 03:37:15.443
TRAVIS: I do not. Yeah, we can get out of here.
Just, on our guard as we go.

03:37:15.443 --> 03:37:18.465
LAURA: Yeah, on our guard, of course.

03:37:18.465 --> 03:37:24.239
MATT: While you're beginning to initiate the
looting process, what are you doing, Caduceus?

03:37:24.239 --> 03:37:35.383
TALIESIN: I am basically holding ready to shoot a
bolt at anything that moves, and I was actually

03:37:35.383 --> 03:37:44.625
hanging a little bit far down just in case one of
them drops, I can heal, and somewhere where I'm

03:37:44.625 --> 03:37:48.530
not going to get attacked by kelp and I'm keeping
very aware.

03:37:48.530 --> 03:37:56.235
MATT: Okay. Well, you were staying over in this
chamber with them. Nott and Beau, you are in the

03:37:56.235 --> 03:38:02.438
central chamber now. Do you want to search for the
possible whereabouts of Dashilla?

03:38:02.438 --> 03:38:08.021
MARISHA: I want to look around and then I want to
head towards that alcove back there.

03:38:08.021 --> 03:38:12.128
SAM: I'm following to make sure she's okay.

03:38:12.128 --> 03:38:14.527
MARISHA: I technically haven't heard shit.

03:38:14.527 --> 03:38:16.406
MATT: Both of you make perception checks.

03:38:16.406 --> 03:38:18.083
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, you're right, you haven't.

03:38:18.083 --> 03:38:18.554
SAM: Five.

03:38:18.554 --> 03:38:26.078
MARISHA: 21. 22. 19.

03:38:26.078 --> 03:38:37.228
MATT: All right. As you turn around the corner and
you edge in here, you see movement behind the

03:38:37.228 --> 03:38:41.500
seaweed, using it as a blanket and a shield.

03:38:41.500 --> 03:38:44.117
MARISHA: In this corridor or in the central
chamber?

03:38:44.117 --> 03:38:49.903
MATT: Where you're looking, you see it move this
direction. You're not sure which path, but

03:38:49.903 --> 03:38:58.032
Dashilla is still present it seems, or something
moving through the seaweed as a cover, behind it

03:38:58.032 --> 03:39:01.343
like a curtain. Which path do you choose?

03:39:01.343 --> 03:39:08.027
MARISHA: I turn to Nott and say: Are we still
fighting this thing?

03:39:08.027 --> 03:39:09.581
SAM: What? I don't see anything. Where?

03:39:09.581 --> 03:39:11.380
MARISHA: She's this way! I move that way.

03:39:11.380 --> 03:39:12.451
MATT: Which way?

03:39:12.451 --> 03:39:14.362
MARISHA: Towards wherever I saw her.

03:39:14.362 --> 03:39:16.787
MATT: You saw her move in the direction of this
fork.

03:39:16.787 --> 03:39:18.075
MARISHA: Of this side fork, right?

03:39:18.075 --> 03:39:20.925
MATT: This side? You saw her move in this
direction, you saw it move through.

03:39:20.925 --> 03:39:21.587
MARISHA: Oh.

03:39:21.587 --> 03:39:23.711
SAM: Just pick one.

03:39:23.711 --> 03:39:25.690
MARISHA: I'll take the right.

03:39:25.690 --> 03:39:31.814
MATT: Take the right? Okay. You move through, and
you're following?

03:39:31.814 --> 03:39:32.690
SAM: Yes.

03:39:32.690 --> 03:39:33.826
MATT: Okay.

03:39:33.826 --> 03:39:44.434
SAM: As I go, I take out my wire and I point and I
whisper a message to Caleb: We went back to the

03:39:44.434 --> 03:39:46.801
left fork but then we went right.

03:39:46.801 --> 03:39:49.395
LIAM: Wrapping up in here.

03:39:49.395 --> 03:40:03.544
MATT: As you come around the corner, you see an
old, decomposing pile of merrow corpses similar to

03:40:03.544 --> 03:40:09.552
the ones that were tied up inside, but these all
have these wounds of their throats slit from side

03:40:09.552 --> 03:40:11.424
to side.

03:40:11.424 --> 03:40:14.580
MARISHA: Oh, sacrifice style.

03:40:14.580 --> 03:40:20.377
MATT: They're all in various states of
decomposition, the freshest one maybe months ago,

03:40:20.377 --> 03:40:28.639
and the sea has caused its own unique form of
bloating and sloughing off of the various parts of

03:40:28.639 --> 03:40:29.713
the skeleton.

03:40:29.713 --> 03:40:30.595
MARISHA: Gross.

03:40:30.595 --> 03:40:33.122
SAM: Is she in here? Do we see any movement?

03:40:33.122 --> 03:40:35.082
MATT: You can make another perception check.

03:40:35.082 --> 03:40:37.039
TALIESIN: I would have made my way a little bit
further.

03:40:37.039 --> 03:40:38.432
MARISHA: All of us?

03:40:38.432 --> 03:40:39.267
SAM: 11.

03:40:39.267 --> 03:40:42.631
MARISHA: Ooh, that was almost a natural 20.
Instead, it's a five!

03:40:42.631 --> 03:40:47.928
MATT: Glancing inside and taking a moment to
really look around, there's no other movement.

03:40:47.928 --> 03:40:49.723
SAM: Other way?

03:40:49.723 --> 03:40:51.132
MARISHA: Sure.

03:40:51.132 --> 03:40:53.671
MATT: You guys shift around.

03:40:53.671 --> 03:40:57.623
SAM: Cast a quick message: We went on the other
one now.

03:40:57.623 --> 03:41:05.870
MATT: As you turn around to the other side, there
you see standing there, another pale, gaunt spirit

03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:08.291
looking right at you.

03:41:08.291 --> 03:41:13.292
MARISHA: Go fuck a ghost! I punch it.

03:41:13.292 --> 03:41:15.245
LIAM: I'm going to go fuck a ghost!

03:41:15.245 --> 03:41:22.468
TRAVIS: Who runs in a haunted house now? That's
fucking amazing.

03:41:22.468 --> 03:41:27.280
MATT: Beauregard, doing probably one of my
favorite things she's ever done in this entire

03:41:27.280 --> 03:41:32.300
campaign, just runs up to fucking punch a ghost.
Go for it.

03:41:32.300 --> 03:41:34.295
LIAM: Too slow, shit stain!

03:41:34.295 --> 03:41:40.026
MARISHA: That's cocked. Not good. It's 11.

03:41:40.026 --> 03:41:41.459
MATT: 11 just hits.

03:41:41.459 --> 03:41:43.718
LIAM: Ghost puncher!

03:41:43.718 --> 03:41:45.980
MARISHA: (singing) Ghost puncher!

03:41:45.980 --> 03:41:47.864
TALIESIN: Puncher of ghosts.

03:41:47.864 --> 03:41:49.978
MARISHA: It's terrible! Five.

03:41:49.978 --> 03:41:51.776
MATT: Five points of damage, okay.

03:41:51.776 --> 03:41:57.782
MARISHA: Okay, second attack. Same thing, 11.
Another five damage!

03:41:57.782 --> 03:42:00.521
MATT: Another five damage, okay.

03:42:00.521 --> 03:42:01.912
MARISHA: Déjà vu.

03:42:01.912 --> 03:42:03.944
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

03:42:03.944 --> 03:42:06.082
MARISHA: I'm going to punch him again.

03:42:06.082 --> 03:42:07.824
LIAM: You're hitting his pressure points.

03:42:07.824 --> 03:42:08.784
MARISHA: It hits.

03:42:08.784 --> 03:42:12.809
TRAVIS: What the fuck? All three ones on her d6s.

03:42:12.809 --> 03:42:14.737
SAM: That's another five.

03:42:14.737 --> 03:42:20.528
MATT: 15 points of damage. You punch the shit out
of a ghost. Now, because I believe at level seven

03:42:20.528 --> 03:42:22.284
you have the capability of--

03:42:22.284 --> 03:42:23.677
MARISHA: To punch ghosts.

03:42:23.677 --> 03:42:25.108
MATT: To punch ghosts!

03:42:25.108 --> 03:42:28.754
MARISHA: I can punch ghosts now. My fists are
magical.

03:42:28.754 --> 03:42:35.036
MATT: With each punch, you watch as the somewhat
spectral glow scatters at each impact, and as she

03:42:35.036 --> 03:42:39.303
pulls back there are three holes in its form where
the fists passed through. The ghost, which was

03:42:39.303 --> 03:42:44.937
normally just staring, goes (ghastly groan) in
surprise.

03:42:44.937 --> 03:42:46.637
TALIESIN: I can see this happen right?

03:42:46.637 --> 03:42:48.523
MARISHA: I know, I go: Caduceus!

03:42:48.523 --> 03:42:51.116
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame.

03:42:51.116 --> 03:42:52.756
MATT: That is a three.

03:42:52.756 --> 03:42:59.800
TALIESIN: That's ten points of radiant damage.

03:42:59.800 --> 03:43:08.146
MATT: All righty. Nott, are you doing anything?

03:43:08.146 --> 03:43:10.146
SAM: Is the ghost still alive?

03:43:10.146 --> 03:43:11.695
MATT: Ghost is still alive, yeah.

03:43:11.695 --> 03:43:13.427
SAM: I will fire at this ghost.

03:43:13.427 --> 03:43:15.374
MATT: Go for it.

03:43:15.374 --> 03:43:18.664
SAM: Not great, 12-- no, 14.

03:43:18.664 --> 03:43:23.646
MATT: 14 hits, roll damage. It is adjacent to Beau
so you get sneak attack on the ghost.

03:43:23.646 --> 03:43:28.212
LAURA: That's really good. Jesus.

03:43:28.212 --> 03:43:30.764
SAM: 29.

03:43:30.764 --> 03:43:43.744
MATT: It dissipates. You watch as its glow
vanishes. This horrible low, dull, vibrating sigh

03:43:43.744 --> 03:43:48.735
slowly goes away and it's no more and he's
immaterial.

03:43:48.735 --> 03:43:51.735
SAM: You punched that ghost really well.

03:43:51.735 --> 03:43:56.116
TALIESIN: I'm staying right at them and I'm
looking for any movement while all this is happening.

03:43:56.391 --> 03:43:57.976
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:43:57.976 --> 03:44:01.265
SAM: Can we go deeper into that chamber? Searching
for movement?

03:44:01.265 --> 03:44:03.592
MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks.

03:44:03.592 --> 03:44:05.446
TALIESIN: 23.

03:44:05.446 --> 03:44:06.130
SAM: Six.

03:44:06.130 --> 03:44:08.802
MARISHA: 17.

03:44:08.802 --> 03:44:16.516
MATT: Okay. You don't see any movement in that
corner. You do, looking inside, see in the far

03:44:16.516 --> 03:44:31.066
back a small hole maybe two inches across where
the base of it-- of the small alcove-- ends. You

03:44:31.066 --> 03:44:32.758
hear voices.

03:44:32.758 --> 03:44:34.003
MARISHA: What?

03:44:34.003 --> 03:44:35.328
SAM: There's a passage.

03:44:35.328 --> 03:44:37.038
LAURA: You can see through to the other side!

03:44:37.038 --> 03:44:40.800
SAM: It's only two inches wide?

03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:43.526
MATT: It's about two inches wide.

03:44:43.526 --> 03:44:47.832
SAM: I'll go over to it and say: Hey guys, can you
hear us?

03:44:47.832 --> 03:44:50.774
MATT: As you're looting the place, you hear these
voices.

03:44:50.774 --> 03:44:53.193
LAURA: Oh, Nott? Is that you?

03:44:53.193 --> 03:44:56.808
SAM: Yeah. We're in a hole.

03:44:56.808 --> 03:44:58.851
LAURA: Are you okay?

03:44:58.851 --> 03:45:00.534
SAM: Yeah, we're fine.

03:45:00.534 --> 03:45:02.065
LAURA: Did you kill the thing?

03:45:02.065 --> 03:45:03.359
SAM: No, we lost her.

03:45:03.359 --> 03:45:06.090
LAURA: Oh, well I'm getting some treasure.

03:45:06.090 --> 03:45:08.102
SAM: Save some for me!

03:45:08.102 --> 03:45:15.858
TRAVIS: I'll turn to Caleb and say: Listen, this
is more your thing than mine, but aren't you at

03:45:15.858 --> 03:45:18.433
least curious about what this pedestal does?

03:45:18.433 --> 03:45:25.368
LIAM: Yeah, I have some ideas and I am curious,
but I want to know what you intend. These come in

03:45:25.368 --> 03:45:26.440
threes, yeah?

03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:31.684
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think it has anything to do
with the sphere; it's not like the lock or the

03:45:31.684 --> 03:45:36.023
temple that I saw before. The top of this pedestal
is covered in rust?

03:45:36.023 --> 03:45:36.796
LIAM: No.

03:45:36.796 --> 03:45:38.836
TRAVIS: Blood?

03:45:38.836 --> 03:45:40.204
LIAM: Yeah.

03:45:40.204 --> 03:45:45.686
TRAVIS: Aren't you the least bit curious what a
little drippy-drip might do?

03:45:45.731 --> 03:45:51.271
(background music)

03:45:51.276 --> 03:45:58.823
LIAM: I'm always curious. Can I count on you to
return the favor?

03:45:59.608 --> 03:46:00.822
TRAVIS: Always.

03:46:00.822 --> 03:46:03.006
LIAM: (slicing) (slamming)

03:46:03.006 --> 03:46:16.428
MATT: Okay. You suffer three points of damage. As
you place your hand down on it, you see this dull

03:46:16.428 --> 03:46:25.988
red glow around the hand that's placed on the
table. As you begin to pull your hand up and look,

03:46:25.988 --> 03:46:30.737
the runes where the blood has splattered have
begun to give a faint glow.

03:46:30.737 --> 03:46:32.684
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:46:32.684 --> 03:46:36.166
LIAM: Has anything changed with the ones on the
walls?

03:46:36.166 --> 03:46:37.810
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:46:37.810 --> 03:46:41.569
LIAM: Okay. I've rolled ass all night, and a
natural 20.

03:46:41.569 --> 03:46:47.711
MATT: You glance over and you can see a faint,
matching, dull red glow on one of the runes across

03:46:47.913 --> 03:46:54.691
the way, just barely peeking through some of the
gently shifting seaweed. Looking down at this

03:46:54.691 --> 03:46:57.952
table, you need a lot of blood to continue to do
this.

03:46:57.952 --> 03:47:03.088
LAURA: No. You'll kill yourself!

03:47:03.088 --> 03:47:05.359
MARISHA: We saw a pile of corpses!

03:47:05.359 --> 03:47:06.615
TRAVIS: I put my--

03:47:06.615 --> 03:47:08.777
MATT: How much damage are you willing to take,
guys?

03:47:08.777 --> 03:47:10.195
LIAM: About nine more.

03:47:10.195 --> 03:47:11.794
TRAVIS: I'll take 20.

03:47:11.794 --> 03:47:13.486
SAM: (groans)

03:47:13.486 --> 03:47:15.753
MARISHA: What are you fucking doing, lopping off
your arm?

03:47:15.753 --> 03:47:18.871
MATT: As you guys begin carving into your hands--

03:47:18.871 --> 03:47:20.292
LAURA: What are you-- why?!

03:47:20.292 --> 03:47:22.208
TRAVIS: Just trying to provoke some chance here.

03:47:22.208 --> 03:47:24.400
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds as they're
hurting themselves.

03:47:24.400 --> 03:47:31.090
MATT: Okay. The blood clouds the water around you,
and then you watch as it is drawn like a magnet to

03:47:31.090 --> 03:47:38.447
the tabletop. As it begins to sit itself in, each
of the runes begins to pull in with each one

03:47:38.447 --> 03:47:46.282
glowing, another rune and the rune (low sounds).
It's almost full, the table isn't there yet. You

03:47:46.282 --> 03:47:54.528
have about two-thirds to three-quarters or so. The
room itself now is beginning to generally have a

03:47:54.528 --> 03:47:57.722
red hue to it as each of these runes is beginning
to fill the area.

03:47:57.722 --> 03:47:59.312
TALIESIN: (whispering) This is such a bad idea.

03:47:59.312 --> 03:48:00.755
LAURA: To you, Caleb, six points.

03:48:00.755 --> 03:48:01.550
LIAM: Thank you.

03:48:01.550 --> 03:48:03.961
LAURA: 12 points healed to you, Fjord.

03:48:03.961 --> 03:48:10.442
TRAVIS: Okay. Is there a chance that we're giving
this to her?

03:48:10.442 --> 03:48:25.260
LIAM: I'm following your lead here. This is your
quest. I have things that I need to do that are

03:48:25.260 --> 03:48:27.649
not here, and I am going to need help.

03:48:27.649 --> 03:48:42.267
TRAVIS: I understand. I think we're good. We can
go.

03:48:42.267 --> 03:48:48.348
SAM: Damn it.

03:48:48.348 --> 03:48:49.220
LIAM: Okay.

03:48:49.220 --> 03:48:52.014
TRAVIS: We understand each other. Cut palm to cut
palm.

03:48:52.014 --> 03:48:54.955
SAM: (whispering) Blood brothers, so cool.

03:48:54.955 --> 03:48:58.656
TRAVIS: I'll start to head out of the chamber.

03:48:58.656 --> 03:49:07.368
LIAM: I follow Fjord out.

03:49:07.368 --> 03:49:12.644
MARISHA: Nott and I meet the rest of them.

03:49:12.644 --> 03:49:17.579
LAURA: I'm going to try to get as much platinum
and stuff as I can before I walk out.

03:49:17.579 --> 03:49:19.122
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:49:19.122 --> 03:49:21.527
TALIESIN: I am just waiting for something to
move.

03:49:21.527 --> 03:49:22.178
MATT: Yeah.

03:49:22.178 --> 03:49:33.337
LAURA: Ten. Nine. But there were piles of shiny
things.

03:49:33.337 --> 03:49:42.588
MATT: I know. You gather in pocket, and counting
it later, you will find that you have found

03:49:42.588 --> 03:49:53.329
roughly three platinum, six gold, 12 silver, and
about 65 copper.

03:49:53.329 --> 03:49:54.423
SAM: Boo.

03:49:54.423 --> 03:49:56.895
TALIESIN: I don't like this place.

03:49:56.895 --> 03:50:04.615
LAURA: All right. I'll follow them out. I'll tap
Yasha: We should get out of here.

03:50:04.615 --> 03:50:12.060
MATT: She's got an uncomfortable look on her face
after watching all this transpire, goes, "Yeah. I

03:50:12.060 --> 03:50:13.650
"think we better should."

03:50:13.650 --> 03:50:16.386
LAURA: I didn't like it either, Yasha.

03:50:16.386 --> 03:50:22.138
MATT: Her brow tenses and she follows you out. As
you all converge towards the central chamber once more--

03:50:22.437 --> 03:50:24.542
LAURA: The guards are floating, following us.

03:50:24.542 --> 03:50:29.477
MATT: As you're walking, some of the seaweed
reaches out and the unicorns (fizzle). It lasts

03:50:29.477 --> 03:50:38.063
for ten minutes, right? As you approach they
eventually flitter out. You all gather there at

03:50:38.063 --> 03:50:39.553
the entrance.

03:50:39.553 --> 03:50:41.223
TALIESIN: Are we out of the cavern now?

03:50:41.223 --> 03:50:44.332
MATT: Are you all backing out of the cavern?

03:50:44.332 --> 03:50:48.091
LIAM: Looking out for this hag as we go, yeah.

03:50:48.091 --> 03:50:51.779
MATT: Okay. For those who haven't rolled
perception checks on this, which I think would be

03:50:51.779 --> 03:50:56.254
Jester, Caleb, and Fjord, go ahead and roll for
me. And Yasha.

03:50:56.254 --> 03:50:58.486
LAURA: 16.

03:50:58.486 --> 03:51:03.088
LIAM: Oh. Still terrible. Ten.

03:51:03.088 --> 03:51:06.319
TRAVIS: 18. Yasha rolled a seven.

03:51:06.319 --> 03:51:11.179
MATT: No sign of movement. No idea where she is.

03:51:11.179 --> 03:51:19.492
TALIESIN: We're going to back out slowly, get out
of this cavern. Does everyone want to meet me

03:51:19.492 --> 03:51:24.822
right-- once we can see the surface of the water?

03:51:24.822 --> 03:51:25.970
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:51:25.970 --> 03:51:27.889
TALIESIN: Are we there? We done?

03:51:27.889 --> 03:51:28.729
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:30.291
TALIESIN: (snapping) Water Walk.

03:51:30.291 --> 03:51:31.592
SAM: What's that?

03:51:31.592 --> 03:51:35.249
TALIESIN: We are going to jet to the surface of
the water. It's 60 feet around.

03:51:35.249 --> 03:51:41.693
MATT: Thanks to the glory of magic, we're not
going to deal with decompression in the bloodstream.

03:51:41.693 --> 03:51:43.094
TRAVIS: Plus, there's water.

03:51:43.094 --> 03:51:44.414
MATT: Instant TPK.

03:51:44.414 --> 03:51:45.924
TRAVIS: It's not air. It's water.

03:51:45.924 --> 03:51:52.287
MATT: Well, the magic is pulling-- Yeah, it's
fine! Magic handwave. It'd be the saddest-- Smash

03:51:52.287 --> 03:51:55.384
cut to the outside of the Squalleater.

03:51:55.384 --> 03:51:59.233
TRAVIS: (choking, bursting)

03:51:59.233 --> 03:52:02.264
MATT: It's all just the end of Total Recall, right
there in the middle of the ocean.

03:52:02.264 --> 03:52:04.159
TALIESIN: It wouldn't be a pressure thing because
we have water in us anyway.

03:52:04.159 --> 03:52:07.985
MATT: I know. I'm saying through the magic, it all
works out fine. As you guys all swim out of the

03:52:07.985 --> 03:52:14.249
cavern, the spell happens. With immense speed, you
all start firing towards the surface (splashing)

03:52:14.249 --> 03:52:20.769
with enough force that when you surface, you all
lift a few feet out and then land. Some of you

03:52:20.769 --> 03:52:24.476
stumble, but you hit the surface of the water, and
it feels like ground.

03:52:24.476 --> 03:52:28.198
TALIESIN: Let's walk to the ship.

03:52:28.198 --> 03:52:33.489
TRAVIS: We were hundreds of feet under water.

03:52:33.489 --> 03:52:38.817
TALIESIN: That's why I made sure to pack some
stuff, just in case. Let's get out of here. That

03:52:38.817 --> 03:52:39.809
place gives me the creeps.

03:52:39.809 --> 03:52:42.294
LAURA: And Dashilla lives to keep being a legend.

03:52:42.294 --> 03:52:45.240
TALIESIN: To keep pouring blood on, well...

03:52:45.240 --> 03:52:46.226
LAURA: That's true.

03:52:46.226 --> 03:52:49.854
MARISHA: I am deeply curious as to what the fuck
happened.

03:52:49.854 --> 03:52:54.464
MATT: You guys can see the Squalleater is a bit of
a hike from where you currently are from where

03:52:54.464 --> 03:52:58.722
you've traveled, but it is visible as there is no
other landmass on the horizon.

03:52:58.722 --> 03:53:01.937
TALIESIN: We'll be moving at twice speed since
it's normal speed and not our halved speed.

03:53:01.937 --> 03:53:02.997
MATT: Correct.

03:53:02.997 --> 03:53:04.797
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

03:53:04.797 --> 03:53:07.232
LAURA: I feel like I'm walking on jello, but I
like it.

03:53:07.232 --> 03:53:11.871
TALIESIN: You ever see those videos with the
(tapping) walking on the pudding. Like that.

03:53:11.871 --> 03:53:18.125
MATT: You guys make your way towards the
Squalleater, hail your team, and are brought back

03:53:18.216 --> 03:53:27.315
onto the ship. The sails are unfurled. As Orly
turns to you, he goes, "Where we going, Captain?"

03:53:27.315 --> 03:53:37.767
TRAVIS: Make for the... Gravid Archipelago?

03:53:37.767 --> 03:53:40.419
MATT: Gravid Archipelago, all righty.

03:53:40.419 --> 03:53:43.686
SAM: That's not where we were going before.

03:53:43.686 --> 03:53:45.048
MATT: "Aye, aye."

03:53:45.048 --> 03:53:46.791
TRAVIS: Sure it is.

03:53:46.791 --> 03:53:48.636
SAM: I thought we were going to the other place--

03:53:48.636 --> 03:53:49.503
MATT: You're not there.

03:53:49.503 --> 03:53:51.034
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:53:51.034 --> 03:53:58.037
MATT: The ship unfurls the functional sails on it
and slowly limps its way in the direction of the

03:53:58.037 --> 03:54:07.801
archipelago. You travel for a good hour or so
before you notice the sky that was somewhat

03:54:07.801 --> 03:54:22.859
cloudy, begin to go rapidly darker, roughly near
where you were. The clouds begin to swell and

03:54:22.859 --> 03:54:28.390
release rain. It begins to rain on your ship, but
you begin to push away from this mounting storm.

03:54:28.390 --> 03:54:33.378
LAURA: She can control the weather?

03:54:33.378 --> 03:54:41.309
MATT: You get the sense that whatever ritual you
began, once she felt safe, she had completed and a

03:54:41.309 --> 03:54:50.452
new storm is being summoned over the Diver's
Grave.

03:54:50.452 --> 03:54:56.158
TRAVIS: Oh shit. We could have sunk our ship.

03:54:57.049 --> 03:54:58.621
MARISHA: You would have sunk our ship.

03:54:58.621 --> 03:55:01.429
TRAVIS: We would have been walking for a long
time!

03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:08.497
MARISHA: All of that, as to why are there are
fucking ships at the bottom of the ocean.

03:55:08.497 --> 03:55:12.409
MATT: At least there would have been a hell of a
skill challenge to get the Squalleater out of the

03:55:12.409 --> 03:55:19.950
center of that storm. As you barely skirt the
outside of this growing storm with enough

03:55:19.950 --> 03:55:24.718
foresight and speed to not be caught in the brunt
of it, we'll end tonight's game.

03:55:24.718 --> 03:55:29.902
TRAVIS: As a point of order, you were right, we
were supposed to head here to fix the ship first.

03:55:29.902 --> 03:55:34.490
I want to do that because we've got a fucked up
ship.

03:55:34.490 --> 03:55:36.904
SAM: No, you do whatever you want to do. You're
the captain.

03:55:36.904 --> 03:55:38.315
TRAVIS: I'll say we'll go to the Bisaft Isle.

03:55:38.315 --> 03:55:40.195
MATT: Bisaft Isle to get repairs done?

03:55:40.195 --> 03:55:41.558
MARISHA: I thought you were just blind with
power.

03:55:41.558 --> 03:55:43.277
LAURA: Yeah, I thought you were doing it on
purpose.

03:55:43.277 --> 03:55:44.905
MARISHA: Like, (clapping) fuck that!

03:55:44.905 --> 03:55:46.842
TRAVIS: No, I want to repair the ship.

03:55:46.842 --> 03:55:51.810
LIAM: I would assume that next game, we're going
to start with a fresh day, so I want to toss in

03:55:51.810 --> 03:56:00.125
that Caleb goes to whatever chamber they're in and
he pulls out the other book from his holsters and

03:56:00.125 --> 03:56:02.680
he writes for hours.

03:56:02.680 --> 03:56:10.447
MATT: All right. We'll pick up there next week,
and we'll have a guest next week.

03:56:10.447 --> 03:56:11.407
SAM: Oh, what?

03:56:11.407 --> 03:56:15.292
MATT: Yeah, excited. We'll be having Deborah Ann
Woll joining us--

03:56:15.292 --> 03:56:18.608
(noises of excitement)

03:56:18.608 --> 03:56:20.483
MATT: Three years in the making, I think it is?

03:56:20.483 --> 03:56:21.319
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:56:21.319 --> 03:56:27.962
MATT: At least two. Excited she's going to be
joining us, and we'll pick up this next thread of

03:56:27.962 --> 03:56:33.603
the story. Well done, guys! That was fun and
Dashilla survived!

03:56:33.603 --> 03:56:35.107
LAURA: Dashilla survived!

03:56:35.107 --> 03:56:38.609
MARISHA: You monsters!

03:56:38.609 --> 03:56:43.712
TRAVIS: That would have been a thing if we had
gotten up and it was like all stormy, and we were

03:56:43.712 --> 03:56:45.560
like (high-pitched) "Where's the boat?"

03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:48.589
MATT: Yeah, if that had happened while you guys
got out of the cave, you would have looked up and

03:56:48.589 --> 03:56:52.736
that sunlight was much darker, and it would have
been you start seeing the shifting in the

03:56:52.736 --> 03:56:54.978
tumultuous surface and be like, "Oh, no."

03:56:54.978 --> 03:56:58.140
TRAVIS: Hey, man, I have been ordered to provoke
every once in a while.

03:56:58.140 --> 03:57:00.626
MATT: Sometimes you got to poke the badger, and I
respect that.

03:57:00.626 --> 03:57:02.232
LIAM: I came out of that with a favor.

03:57:02.232 --> 03:57:03.586
TRAVIS and MATT: You did.

03:57:03.586 --> 03:57:11.130
MATT: All right, we'll pick that up next week.
Once again, fantastic job on the intro and Kami

03:57:11.165 --> 03:57:15.035
and Kevin and everyone involved with the music. It
was such a great job. I'm so happy with how that

03:57:15.035 --> 03:57:20.977
turned out. Thank you for joining us tonight, we
love you, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

03:57:20.977 --> 03:57:22.783
(cheering)

03:57:22.783 --> 03:57:32.054
(no audio)

03:57:32.054 --> 03:57:36.616

03:57:39.139 --> 03:57:41.079
[explosion]

03:57:41.079 --> 03:57:49.106
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

03:57:49.106 --> 03:57:54.948
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

03:57:54.948 --> 03:58:02.367
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

03:58:02.367 --> 03:58:09.466
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

03:58:09.466 --> 03:58:13.929
Villains beware 'cause you're 'bout to be dead.

03:58:17.459 --> 03:58:23.726
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

03:58:23.963 --> 03:58:31.620
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

03:58:31.620 --> 03:58:34.566
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

03:58:34.566 --> 03:58:43.740
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

03:58:43.740 --> 03:58:48.859
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Dig in deep in your soul as the legend

03:58:48.859 --> 03:58:58.702
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

03:58:58.702 --> 03:59:07.860

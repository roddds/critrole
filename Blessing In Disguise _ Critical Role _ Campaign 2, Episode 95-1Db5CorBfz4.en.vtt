00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.210
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.470
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.690
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.360
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.050
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.977
MATT: That may be the most ridiculous one yet.

7
00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:13.379
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: It's on the possible range.

8
00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.630
TRAVIS: We try.
MATT: You do.

9
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.490
Anyway, welcome!

10
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.970
Before we jump into tonight's session,

11
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.500
we have some announcements to get through

12
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.692
beginning with the first of our two sponsors tonight,

13
00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:25.243
the beginning, the first one, NordVPN. Sam.

14
00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:27.980
(techno beat)
(frantic keyboard clicking)

15
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.800
SAM: We're almost in, Cryptonic.

16
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.270
Only one more firewall to the Ultra Codex.

17
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.000
LAURA: It's taken 18 straight hours

18
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.660
of side channel spoof dashing,

19
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.171
but with NordVPN's help, we're going to crash this code.

20
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:42.362
(exhaling)

21
00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:43.930
(laughter)

22
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.455
SAM: A-Teaming the small wonder.

23
00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.140
LAURA: Grinding the log stroker.

24
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.744
SAM: Gleaming the cube.

25
00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:51.990
SAM and LAURA: (gasping) Simul-sliced?

26
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.306
Again?!

27
00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:54.228
LAURA: But how?

28
00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:56.160
We're protected by NordVPN,

29
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.390
a personal virtual private network service provider

30
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.980
that shields your activity and blocks annoying ads.

31
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.590
SAM: And it's easy to download at NordVPN.com/criticalrole.

32
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.140
But if the two 1337est hackzors

33
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.060
on the web can't break the Ultra Codex--

34
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.147
Ah, maybe we should just de-res our logins.

35
00:01:14.147 --> 00:01:17.879
MATTHEW: Negatronic!
SAM and LAURA: What?!

36
00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:18.720
TRAVIS: <i>Nani</i>?

37
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.553
(yelling)

38
00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:21.650
MATTHEW: It is I, the Cereal Killer, broadcasting

39
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.570
coast to coast to help foil this heinous scheme.

40
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.723
SAM: But wait!

41
00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:30.780
I heard after da Vinci, you went dark, you de-booted.

42
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.330
MATTHEW: Sure, I control-alt-deleted from your existence.

43
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.300
But from my world, I've been

44
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.910
watching you in my virtual mainframe.

45
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.527
I haven't seen clu-- (stutters)

46
00:01:39.527 --> 00:01:40.397
(laughter)

47
00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:44.050
MATTHEW: -- cube gleamers like you since the '90s.

48
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.690
And I've got news: the Ultra Codex is hackable.

49
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.995
LAURA: Impossible.

50
00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:50.445
We've tried everything.
SAM: Yeah.

51
00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:51.560
MATTHEW: Oh, yeah.

52
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.150
You've been hacking heavy metal,

53
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.599
but have you tried the Mobius device?

54
00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.983
(grunting)
(gasping)

55
00:01:57.983 --> 00:01:59.491
(laughter)
MARISHA: Whoa.

56
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:02.730
LAURA: You mean the legend is real?

57
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.360
MATTHEW: Zero one one zero zero one one.

58
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.950
SAM: That's binary for yes.

59
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.320
LAURA: I know that's binary for yes.

60
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.870
MATTHEW: Cryptonic Override, BlackWillow73@aol.com,

61
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.320
I give you the secret key into the hacknet.

62
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.700
With it, you will feel like a god.

63
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.990
Now get ready to jack in for justice.

64
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.439
SAM: Okay.

65
00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.935
MATTHEW: I can't see, my--

66
00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.508
(laughter)

67
00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:28.246
SAM: There's no depth perception.
MATTHEW: No depth perception.

68
00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:32.870
On my mark, un-Gary the sys dot Gygax.

69
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.037
(yelling)

70
00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:38.643
SAM: Okay, the modem is buzzing.

71
00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:39.476
(frantic keyboard clicking)

72
00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:41.970
MATTHEW: Switch the phantom logic on triad protocol.

73
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.491
LAURA: Alpha channel?
MATTHEW: No, damn it, beta.

74
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.890
LAURA: Positronic, target online.

75
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.607
MATTHEW: Wait, they throw up a DOS
blue cipher on the long freak.

76
00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:57.260
SAM: Are they trying to skizzjam our Goof Troop?

77
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.950
MATTHEW: I'm blasting through the portal,

78
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.420
force them down the 4chan.

79
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.733
Now just enter the password.

80
00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:07.420
SAM, LAURA, and MATTHEW: It's swordfish!

81
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.587
(yelling)

82
00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:16.158
(digital bleeping)
(dial up tones)

83
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.380
MATTHEW: Excellent, they fell right
into my trap and got fried.

84
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.450
Now no one'll stop my Ultra Codex because

85
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.320
Black Willow and Cryptonic Override are in the internet.

86
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.170
And because I'm protected by NordVPN,

87
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.045
they will be in there forever.

88
00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:38.520
(evil laugh)

89
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.489
Speaking of NordVPN.

90
00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.245
(laughter)

91
00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:44.580
MATTHEW: It's their 8th birthday and everyone who gets

92
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.470
a three year plan will receive one additional month free.

93
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.542
That's incredible! That is a gift!

94
00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:53.607
Critters, you have got to log in

95
00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:57.680
to NordVPN.com/criticalrole

96
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.890
or use the coupon criticalrole at checkout.

97
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.369
Matt Mercer, hack to you.

98
00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.463
(laughter)

99
00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:07.633
ASHLEY: Wow.
MATT: Holy shit.

100
00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:08.986
ASHLEY: Yeah!

101
00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:09.977
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

102
00:04:09.977 --> 00:04:11.832
(laughter)

103
00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:13.198
MATT: Thank you.

104
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.757
Thank you, Matt Lillard.

105
00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:18.850
TRAVIS: Fucking Matthew Lillard.

106
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.800
MATT: My--

107
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.050
(cheering)

108
00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:25.365
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

109
00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.140
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

110
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.240
MATT: I think we've gone too far.

111
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.740
I think we've finally gone too far.

112
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.720
TALIESIN: Well, I've peaked.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

113
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.070
Shut it all down, guys.

114
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.080
(laughter)

115
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.538
MATT: Thank you, Sam, thank you, Laura,

116
00:04:39.538 --> 00:04:41.390
thank you, Matthew Lillard, and--

117
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.330
LAURA: What?
MATT: Thank you, NordVPN,

118
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.060
for sponsoring our show and whatever that was.

119
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.855
SAM: No, no.
LAURA: No no no no.

120
00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:52.530
SAM: We're Laura and Sam, Cryptonic Override--
LAURA: Don't know what you're talking about.

121
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.700
ASHLEY: You're not, I'm sorry--

122
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.380
TRAVIS: Do you know what happened just a second ago?

123
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.810
SAM: No, we were in the--
LAURA: We were both--

124
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.294
SAM: Backstage, we were--
LAURA: We had the shits.

125
00:04:59.294 --> 00:05:00.704
SAM: We had the shits.

126
00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:02.954
(laughter)

127
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.935
MATT: Thank you guys for finally showing up, then.

128
00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:09.266
(laughter)

129
00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:10.099
LAURA: Simul-shits?
SAM: We had the simul-shits.

130
00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:11.835
SAM: What? Again?
LAURA: Again?

131
00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:13.598
(laughter)
MATT: Oh my god.

132
00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:15.174
TRAVIS: Oh my god, my face hurts.

133
00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:17.980
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: A single Chekhov play.

134
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.430
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

135
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.632
That's what happens when you don't do theater too long.

136
00:05:22.632 --> 00:05:24.120
(laughter)

137
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.480
You start doing this shit.

138
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.310
Thank you, NordVPN.

139
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.892
Our second sponsor tonight,

140
00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:31.790
our friends at D&amp;D Beyond, who have been with us

141
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.319
since the beginning of the campaign.

142
00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.260
(cheering)

143
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.858
Thank you guys so much for supporting our amazing show.

144
00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:38.850
If you haven't had a chance to check out or use their tool,

145
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.600
their amazing online digital tool for keeping track of

146
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.660
your campaigns and your characters and all other facets

147
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.800
of your D&amp;D playtime, it's awesome.

148
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.270
They, today, updated the most recent revision

149
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.130
of the Blood Hunter class, which I created

150
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.310
and recently revised as part of a great

151
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.340
DMs Guild charity push, bundle push

152
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.930
to help for relief for the Australian bush fires.

153
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.410
It went really well, the amazing community contributors

154
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.270
at DMs Guild put together numerous great packages

155
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.120
and I think altogether, between DMs Guild and DriveThruRPG,

156
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.080
they raised over $300,000 for charity, which is amazing.

157
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.257
Super happy to be a part of that all.

158
00:06:16.257 --> 00:06:19.180
The Blood Hunter is now on D&amp;D Beyond for free

159
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.188
and you find it at DMs Guild as well for download

160
00:06:22.188 --> 00:06:24.960
for free as well.
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

161
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.220
MATT: Let's see, we got a few other announcements here.

162
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.170
Laura, you got something to talk about.

163
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.000
LAURA: Super excited to officially announce

164
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.255
that we have arrived at Hot Topic.

165
00:06:35.255 --> 00:06:37.900
(cheering)

166
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.050
MATT: My inner 16 year old is going,

167
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.390
"What?!"

168
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.483
LAURA: On so many levels, today, just so many levels.

169
00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:48.298
Yeah, so a lot of you have already noticed

170
00:06:48.298 --> 00:06:49.690
and may have already gone to the stores and seen

171
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.143
our four shirts and our hoodie, if you guys want to.

172
00:06:52.143 --> 00:06:55.072
Do-do da do-do da doo!

173
00:06:55.072 --> 00:06:57.180
Oh wait, there's a hoodie, too.

174
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.160
MARISHA: Oh, wait, wait, eh, eh, ooh.

175
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.290
LAURA: Oh my.
MARISHA: Oh.

176
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.120
LAURA: So yeah, they're online and they're at the stores.

177
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.120
You can find them online, hottopic.com/criticalrole.

178
00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:12.946
If you can't find them at your local store,

179
00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:15.680
just ask the store's associate for help, they can maybe,

180
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.540
they can order it, they can ship it to you.

181
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.350
I know that some of them are already

182
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.020
sold out online, but they're on

183
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.480
back order right now and they're getting more.

184
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.070
What?
TALIESIN: Or you could turn

185
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.780
your local Hot Topic sales associate on to Critical Role.

186
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.230
LAURA: I mean, just spread the gospel.

187
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.790
So yeah, you can only get these shirts through Hot Topic,

188
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.050
so you can go check it out now.

189
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.100
And I should definitely say that

190
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.090
the Mighty Nein illustration one.

191
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.430
TALIESIN: That one.

192
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.340
LAURA: Yes, that one is Selina Erika Esperitu.

193
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.740

Oh. Yeah.

Monsterhearts the game, it's incredible.

216
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.950
It's designed by Adria Alder, Avery Alder, there we go.

217
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.300
Make sure I get that wrong.

218
00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:57.910
It's a great game where we

219
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.055
get to be teenagers in high school.

220
00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:02.720
Also, secretly, monsters and all sorts of chaos and tension

221
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.482
and angst and stuff ensues.

222
00:09:05.482 --> 00:09:07.765
So check it out tomorrow night here at 7:00pm

223
00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:12.118
and it'll be VOD thereafter and will be on YouTube on Sunday

224
00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:15.783
for those who can't check it live, so look forward to that.

225
00:09:15.783 --> 00:09:16.624
MARISHA: And it's sexy.

226
00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:17.763

SAM: We clap now, it's a thing on our show. (laughs)

250
00:10:13.443 --> 00:10:15.439
MATT: Yeah, there you go.

Ever evolving.

252
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.030
I believe that is it.

MARISHA: -- ores.
MATT: And welcome back.

287
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.888
(laughter)

288
00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:10.508
TALIESIN: Hackzors.
TRAVIS: I don't claim to know her.

289
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.910
MATT: So last we left off, The Mighty Nein

290
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.381
had found their way to Kamordah and the mountains northward

291
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:24.012
to try and engage with the old crone,

292
00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:27.743
the Prism Sage Isharnai, to break the curse

293
00:12:27.743 --> 00:12:30.325
that still holds Nott within her physical form.

294
00:12:30.325 --> 00:12:32.512
A deal was struck through the use of

295
00:12:32.512 --> 00:12:34.790
memory altering magic via Jester

296
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.793
and you escaped without conflict,

297
00:12:36.793 --> 00:12:39.300
for the time being, with the creature.

298
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.787
You battled some undead in the swamp

299
00:12:40.787 --> 00:12:43.544
as you fled into the night and after survival

300
00:12:43.544 --> 00:12:46.490
and a safe rest, you made your way back to Rosohna,

301
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.776
where you collected yourselves, your intent,

302
00:12:48.776 --> 00:12:50.941
and asked Essek if he could help transport you

303
00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:54.291
to the Whitedawn Lagoon, where it seemed

304
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:59.291
visions of Caduceus' Wildmother-given journey,

305
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.248
and finishing what his family
had set out to accomplish, lie.

306
00:13:04.248 --> 00:13:06.844
After transporting yourselves to the exterior of the jungle

307
00:13:06.844 --> 00:13:08.639
where it seems the Circle of Beasts,

308
00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:12.744
the oasis that contains one of these collections,

309
00:13:12.744 --> 00:13:15.235
the Stone family in particular,

310
00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:18.552
that is the next step of this vision quest.

311
00:13:18.552 --> 00:13:21.615
You made a parasol for Essek and sent him on his way

312
00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:22.536
(laughter)

313
00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:25.335
and you began to traverse the dangerous jungle.

314
00:13:26.197 --> 00:13:28.382
A short time into your journey,

315
00:13:28.382 --> 00:13:31.425
rest was taken and night was set.

316
00:13:32.527 --> 00:13:35.382
In the middle of your evening's watch,

317
00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:39.498
Jester was called away from the camp spot by a familiar

318
00:13:39.498 --> 00:13:42.151
green cloaked figure.

319
00:13:42.151 --> 00:13:45.593
Called by the Traveler to the shadows of the jungle.

320
00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:51.292
The Traveler revealed a lot more

321
00:13:51.292 --> 00:13:55.835
about his past than you were previously aware,

322
00:13:56.847 --> 00:14:01.563
learning that the Traveler may not be entirely

323
00:14:01.563 --> 00:14:05.304
a god in the sense that you had anticipated or believed,

324
00:14:05.304 --> 00:14:08.782
but had discovered Jester many years ago,

325
00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:11.453
as this entity traversed the land,

326
00:14:11.453 --> 00:14:15.202
saw chaotic kinship within her,

327
00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:17.958
and this worship that Jester gave,

328
00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:22.958
this love and trust that was placed into this entity,

329
00:14:23.431 --> 00:14:26.434
gave it purpose in a way it wasn't expecting,

330
00:14:26.434 --> 00:14:31.194
which led to it seeking other people

331
00:14:31.194 --> 00:14:35.970
to join this family of belief and trust

332
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.944
and forthright interest in adding

333
00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:40.511
more chaos to the world around them.

334
00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:44.462
He also revealed himself to be

335
00:14:44.462 --> 00:14:47.587
a long, orange-haired

336
00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:50.370
fey entity

337
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.672
and revealed that he had no idea what he was doing

338
00:14:53.672 --> 00:14:55.950
and he desperately needed your help.

339
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.150
And that was where we left off.

340
00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.739
The Traveler, hood held back,

341
00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:06.517
standing above you, tall, lanky, graceful limbs,

342
00:15:06.517 --> 00:15:11.517
eyes filled with mysterious age and

343
00:15:11.925 --> 00:15:13.949
anxiety

344
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:16.340
looking towards you, continues on.

345
00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.769
"I am not any less than I have been,

346
00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:22.521
"for the pretense itself is a bit of trickery

347
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:26.050
"and I think that even you can appreciate that, Jester.

348
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.676
"I am Lord Artagan of the Morncrown

349
00:15:30.676 --> 00:15:34.322
"and I am the Traveler.

350
00:15:34.322 --> 00:15:38.338
"You, Jester Lavore, are my protege,

351
00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:41.609
"and most prized pupil.

352
00:15:41.609 --> 00:15:43.257

361
00:16:00.552 --> 00:16:05.045
I guess, Artagan?

MATT: "The Traveler is fine."

363
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:08.152
LAURA: Traveler.

364
00:16:11.817 --> 00:16:14.649
Do you want this?

365
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.748
MATT: "I think I--"
LAURA: Do you want to be a god?

366
00:16:20.082 --> 00:16:20.915
TALIESIN: (coughing)

378

LAURA: Well, I mean, do you get more power

379
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.300
from more people following you?

380
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.950
MATT: "It feels that way to an extent."

381
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.350
LAURA: If they follow you, do you have to answer them?

382
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.520
MATT: "Not always.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.350

386
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.962
LAURA: Well, I mean, whatever we decide,

387
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.640
I mean, are you still going to hang out with me?

388
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.898
MATT: "If you'll have me."

389
00:17:38.898 --> 00:17:40.431
LAURA: Okay, good.

390
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.311
I would be really sad if, you know,

391
00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:46.290
you didn't want to do that anymore.

392
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.723
MATT: "Oh, if I was to leave, I'd take you with me."

393
00:17:48.723 --> 00:17:51.206
LAURA: Oh, that's fun. Where would we go?

394
00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:53.672

MATT: "This is but one of many Prime Materials.

"I'd be curious to see what else lies out there, hmm?"

401
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.771
LAURA: Me too! I mean, we have to, you know,

402
00:18:10.771 --> 00:18:15.690
take care of some stuff here first, but.

403
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.000
Do you know what's going on with everyone that, you know,

404
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.841
I'm hanging out with?

405
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:26.013
MATT: "No, not entirely.

406
00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:27.490
"They seem rather boorish.

LAURA: Oh, well he would never judge, you know.

411
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.450
He's actually really polite and, I mean, yeah,

412
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.030
kind of a mama's boy, but not in that way.

413
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.540
I mean, he's really reliable,

414
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.740
is really what it comes down to.

415
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.530
MATT: "Your friends, your companions--"

416
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.880
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

417
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.120
MATT: "What are their thoughts on us?"

418
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.900
LAURA: They all seem pretty supportive of it.

419
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.630
You know, some of them are like,

420
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.940
"Oh, I don't know, I've not heard of him before,"

421
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.410
and I've told them all about you,

422
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.243
so they know.
MATT: "Well, I mean, it's still

423
00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:18.570
"kind of a new thing, we're working on."

424
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.403
LAURA: Right, right.
MATT: "The branding aspect

425
00:19:19.403 --> 00:19:21.069
"is its own challenge."
LAURA: But here's the question:

426
00:19:21.069 --> 00:19:23.730
I mean, should I be telling people about you?

427
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.080
MATT: "Well, of course, that was the whole idea."

428
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.350
LAURA: Well, I know, but the more people I tell,

429
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.850
the more people that are going to want to

430
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.588
rely on you--
MATT: "I know!"

431
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.030
LAURA: And you'll have to answer to them. What do we do?

432
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.503
MATT: "That's why I'm here. I don't know!

433
00:19:36.503 --> 00:19:39.194
"I like the attention--

434
00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:41.120
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay
MATT: "But--"

435
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.720
LAURA: I have, here's an option.

436
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.100
MATT: "Yes?"
LAURA: What if, you know,

437
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.780
at Traveler Con, we establish you as, like,

438
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.430
this god that can always hear, but you're more like

439
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.680
the other gods, you know, that are like,

440
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.710
oh, you know, like, okay.

441
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.710
So Caduceus, he worships, like, this Wildmother

442
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.696
MATT: "I'm familiar."
LAURA: Yeah.

443
00:20:02.696 --> 00:20:05.430
So like, when he asks her questions,

444
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.354
you know what she does?

445
00:20:07.354 --> 00:20:09.010
MATT: "Nothing?"
LAURA: She blows the wind.

446
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.700
Exactly, she does shit.

447
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.558
(laughter)

448
00:20:11.558 --> 00:20:13.650
So and he's like, "I sensed, you know,

449
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.840
"I understand what she's saying."

450
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.510
She's not doing anything, but he thinks she is.

451
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.890
MATT: "Interesting."
LAURA: Yeah.

452
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.887
MATT: "And he seems, ugh, content?"

453
00:20:23.887 --> 00:20:26.037
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. He's, like, totally into her.

454
00:20:26.037 --> 00:20:29.370
MATT: "(sighs) People are strange."
LAURA: I know.

455
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.300
So you could be like that, you know,

456
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.720
where people ask you things and you don't do anything

457
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.360
and they'll still think you're doing something.

458
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.810
MATT: "But I've already been so involved.

459
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.120
"Won't they be disappointed if suddenly

460
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.260
"I'm just not appearing?"
LAURA: Well,

461
00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.080
we just have to establish it as, like,

462
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.690
there's, like, a new way of doing things, you know?

463
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:47.880
MATT: "Interesting."

464
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.970
LAURA: Like, you've gotten so powerful

465
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.150
that you're always-always with us

466
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.460
and you hear our thoughts and,

467
00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.590
you control everything and--

468
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.740
MATT: "So the party is a goodbye,

469
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.780
"kind of, loosely."
LAURA: But not for me, not for me,

470
00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.210
just for all those other people

471
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.650
that are, like, less important.

472
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.279
MATT: "And now they have friends, they've met, they can--"

473
00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:15.020
LAURA: They can rely on each other.
MATT: "I love that.

474
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.530
"When anything goes good, it's because of me.

475
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.070
"If anything goes bad, it's because of them."

476
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.781
LAURA: Right! Or, you know, they'll find

477
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:23.214
greater purpose in the bad things, you know.

478
00:21:23.214 --> 00:21:26.020
They'll be like, "Oh, everything happens for a reason."

479
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.190
MATT: "It's ridiculous."
LAURA: I know.

480
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.132
MATT: "But I'm happy for them to be content with that."

481
00:21:29.132 --> 00:21:31.424
LAURA: I know, I know. So.

482
00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:35.614
MATT: "Nothing happens for a reason,
it's absolute <i>fucking</i> chaos."

483
00:21:35.614 --> 00:21:38.080
(laughter)

484
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.029
LIAM: This guy.

485
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.910
(laughter)

486
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.798
ASHLEY: Help him.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

487
00:21:42.798 --> 00:21:46.350
LAURA: So I mean, one of the things we could do, you know,

488
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.060
what if I just had everybody, like all my friends,

489
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.310
you know--
MATT: "Yes?"

490
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.500
LAURA: What if we got to Traveler Con and we were all, like,

491
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.270
your high priests and high priestesses and stuff?

492
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.780
And, like, we helped establish

493
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.600
how the religion was going to be, you know?

494
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.550
We could show people how to pray to you

495
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.196
if they haven't done that before, you know?

496
00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:09.751
MATT: "All right.

497
00:22:09.751 --> 00:22:13.520
"I'm going to warn you, it's a very eclectic mix."

498
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.460
LAURA: Are any of them as powerful as me?

499
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.000
MATT: "No, not at all."
LAURA: Okay,

500
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.110
so we can totally fool them.

501
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.118
MATT: "Yet."
LAURA: Okay.

502
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.620
MATT: "What?"
LAURA: Well,

503
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.780
you got to make sure I'm always ahead of them.

504
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.290
MATT: "Well, you're doing great.

505
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:31.197
"I'm not, look, just don't worry, just don't get lazy."

506
00:22:31.197 --> 00:22:33.030
LAURA: (exhale) I'm never going to be lazy.

507
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.230
MATT: "I know.

508
00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.730
"Well.

509
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.250
"So we gather your friends, convince them

510
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.790
"to help, you act as acolytes."

511
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.660
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "We have celebration--"

512
00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.910
LAURA: Yeah, what are we going to do there?

513
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.808
I mean, what do we just, like, give,
like, a concert or, like--

514
00:22:52.808 --> 00:22:54.491
MATT: "<i>No theater</i>.

515
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:55.907
"But.

516
00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:58.100
(laughter)

517
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.450
"Music, music perhaps.

518
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.160
"We can bring some performers in."

519
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.993
LAURA: Okay.

520
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.650
MATT: "Yes, yes.

521
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.112
"Refreshments."
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

522
00:23:10.112 --> 00:23:11.428
MATT: "Right, right."
LAURA: Yeah.

523
00:23:11.428 --> 00:23:14.668
MATT: "We could do some displays of power.

524
00:23:14.668 --> 00:23:17.370
"I mean, it is a volcano, maybe we can make it erupt."

525
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.090
LAURA: Well, just make sure, you know, that,

526
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.220
well, I mean it would solve your problems

527
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.960
if, like, they all got wiped out at the same time,

528
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.220
I suppose.
MATT: "True."

529
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.930
LAURA: Then they wouldn't be relying on you anymore

530
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.830
but your power might get less.

531
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.390
MATT: "It's not even about the power at this point,

532
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.140
"it's just about keeping it interesting."

533
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.790
LAURA: Oh. Well, then, you know, that could be something.

534
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.270
But, you know, I'll be there

535
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.070
and you love me so much, that would be

536
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.540
not so fun, right? Yeah.
MATT: "Yes, no, valid point.

537
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.750
"No volcano."
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

538
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.520
MATT: "Yet."
LAURA: Wait 'til we leave.

539
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.560
MATT: "Maybe."
LAURA: Oh.

540
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.320
MATT: "So should it be like a

541
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.450
"ta-ta and I leave into the sky?"

542
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.230
LAURA: I mean, maybe we can make you, can you--

543
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.670
MATT: "Turn to dust, like--"
LAURA: Can you make yourself

544
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.830
grow, like, super, super, super big

545
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.060
and, like, fill up the whole sky

546
00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.310
like, you know, like this great big presence?

547
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.950
And then you, like, lift up and you disappear

548
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.060
and we're like, "(gasps) He ascended."

549
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.410
MATT: "A visual ascension."
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.590
MATT: "And now I am with them at all times,

551
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.830
"not answering a damn thing."
LAURA: Right, but they'll think

552
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.200
you're even bigger than you ever have been.

553
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.440
You're answering to so many people,

554
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.190
you can't possibly be there with them personally.

555
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.700
MATT: "But they'll have each other.

556
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.750
"Delightfully foolish, I love it."

557
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.300
LAURA: We'll tell them you can
also communicate through the wind.

558
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.240
MATT: "I feel like that's a bit
hackneyed territory, to be honest."

559
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.073
LAURA: All right, all right, all right.

560
00:24:44.073 --> 00:24:47.460
MATT: "Melora kind of leans in that space

561
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.140
"a bit heavy for me."
LAURA: Okay.

562
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.440
Well, we're steer clear of that, I guess, but.

563
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.453
MATT: "All right.

564
00:24:53.453 --> 00:24:56.170
"Well, let's table the miracle for now.

565
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.110
"I'll put some thought to it.

566
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.980
"If anything comes inspiration-wise to you--"

567
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.280
LAURA: All right, but we should definitely come up with

568
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.110
some sort of ceremony to make you ascend.

569
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.260
MATT: "Right. All right, okay.

570
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.610
"I'll start assembling some flowers, pillars--"

571
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.108
LAURA: Ooh.
MATT: "An archway."

572
00:25:12.108 --> 00:25:13.975
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: "I've got some ideas."

573
00:25:13.975 --> 00:25:16.460
LAURA: Ooh, ooh, ooh.
MATT: "Ooh, what?"

574
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.440
LAURA: Can you open up your gateway

575
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.750
and, like, bring some stuff in from another plane

576
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.190
and that way, like, people are seeing things

577
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.920
that they've never seen before and it'll make it, like,

578
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.950
even more powerful and special then?

579
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.798
MATT: "I, mm, I can open a gateway.

580
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.124
"The gateway to my

581
00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:37.890
"'home' realm is a bit stationary,

582
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.570
"but I can still

583
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.160
"give the essence of it."

584
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.280
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "I can make it presentory.

585
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.740
"Grandiose."
LAURA: I like it.

586
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.860
MATT: "Illusory but effective, especially for

587
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.545
"the layman."
LAURA: Okay.

588
00:25:53.281 --> 00:25:57.175
And I will make programs,

589
00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.800
you know, to pass out to everyone

590
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.910
so they'll have, like, something to take home with them

591
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.743
and they could get--
MATT: "Keepsakes."

592
00:26:03.743 --> 00:26:04.850
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: "Interesting.

593
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.540
"Things to shadowbox."
LAURA: Yeah.

594
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.930
MATT: "Good, good."
LAURA: Yeah.

595
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.600
MATT: "No, it's important to have a physical memory

596
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.710
"of the occasion."
LAURA: Yeah.

597
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.010
MATT: "A reminder. Good.

598
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.880
"See, this is why I came to you.

599
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.210
"I'm so bad at planning."

600
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.510
LAURA: You know--
MATT: "I'm more of a

601
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.630
"in the moment and improvised

602
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.510
"kind of--"
LAURA: I understand.

603
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.280
I mean, obviously we'll leave room for craziness to happen.

604
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.756
MATT: "Oh, there will be craziness,
my Jester, don't you worry.

605
00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:32.806
"Hm, all right.

606
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.730
"This gives me much to think about."

607
00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.010
LAURA: Did you want to come say hi to everyone?

608
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.810
I mean, they're going to be your high priests and stuff.

609
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.065
MATT: "They appear to be sleeping."
LAURA: That's true.

610
00:26:46.065 --> 00:26:49.180
MATT: "Do they like being woken up
in the middle of the night?"

611
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.570
LAURA: I mean--
MATT: "How about I wait

612
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.540
"'til breakfast, after they have eaten?"

613
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.460
LAURA: We'll eat, then you will, like, come in,

614
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.990
see if we can fool them and make them think

615
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.820
that you're, like, even bigger than you are, right?

616
00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.280
So like, they will, like, see what we can do for them

617
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.220
to make other, it'll be like a test run.

618
00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.600
MATT: "Okay, so, mm, all right, so we're

619
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.770
"trying to trick your friends as well."

620
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.130
LAURA: Yeah, but then we'll let them know.

621
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.250
MATT: "I'll follow your lead."
LAURA: Okay.

622
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.630
MATT: "You'll know when I arrive."
LAURA: Yes, I will.

623
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.463
MATT: "Jester."

624
00:27:23.347 --> 00:27:24.180
LAURA: Well,

625
00:27:25.135 --> 00:27:26.460
I just,

626
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.630
but does this mean you're not always with me?

627
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.810
MATT: "It means I'll be with you
as much as I've always been."

628
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.000
LAURA: (sighing)

629
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.480
MATT: "And if they're not yelling into my ears as much,

630
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.890
"maybe I can be around more often."

631
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.140
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "You're still my favorite."

632
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.373
LAURA: And you're always mine.

633
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.460
MATT: "Go, rest."

634
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.810
He extends his hand and you watch as

635
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.086
all the local bush bends and pulls away.

636
00:27:53.086 --> 00:27:54.960
LAURA: Could you do this the rest of the time, though?

637
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.010
Because this would really help our trek through the jungles.

638
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.610
MATT: "Oh, I'm sure it, but I've got a lot to do with

639
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.220
"the planning and the individuals, you understand.

640
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.610
"But I'm, I've given you some tools.

641
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.160
"I'm sure you can find your way."

642
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.190
LAURA: I'll find my way.
MATT: "If you rely on me

643
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.470
"continuously, how are you going to prove yourself?"

644
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.820
LAURA: How will I be more powerful than

645
00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.310
everyone else?
MATT: "Exactly."

646
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.490
LAURA: I'm going to find my way back.

647
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.270
You don't even need to make this path for me.

648
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.650
I'll take it, but you don't need to.

649
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.590
And walk really fast away so that he doesn't take it away

650
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.572
as I make my way--
MATT: Okay.

651
00:28:25.572 --> 00:28:26.678
He does this with his hand and you watch

652
00:28:26.678 --> 00:28:28.569
the little flowers go poop, ploop, ploop, ploop,

653
00:28:28.569 --> 00:28:31.760
following your foot falls as you make your way through.

654
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.788
"It can just be beautiful, it doesn't have to be helpful,"

655
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.137
and you just run forward and look back and he's gone.

656
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.385
LAURA: My shoulders kind of slump.

657
00:28:50.556 --> 00:28:55.239
And I go back to my tent, the dome, and I sit down.

658
00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.613
Oh man.

659
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.743
Can you hear me now?

660
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.323
Oh man.

661
00:29:07.158 --> 00:29:10.890
And I go to sleep.
MATT: Oh.

662
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.723
All right.

663
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.760
The watch goes uneventful throughout the evening,

664
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.637
thanks to the protectiveness of the dome.

665
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.880
The morning comes to.

666
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.520
It is warm as the dome

667
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.880
vanishes at the ending of its duration.

668
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.290
The humidity and the heat immediately comes in sticky.

669
00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.140
You can hear the insects heavily

670
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.090
starting to buzz around you.

671
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.100
The air still has that strange earthy sweetness to it

672
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.320
like various flowers and heavy jungle plants

673
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.150
are giving off aromas to attract

674
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.410
insects or larger creatures towards them.

675
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.880
Oh my god, Sam.

676
00:29:54.653 --> 00:29:55.920
(laughter)

677
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.100
TRAVIS: Fuck--
LAURA: You stupid--

678
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.487
TRAVIS: Out of control.

679
00:29:58.487 --> 00:30:00.737
(laughter)

680
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.073
MATT: (throat clearing)

681
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:09.002
But you all come to consciousness.

682
00:30:09.002 --> 00:30:11.150
(birds calling in background)

683
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.590
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MARISHA: Ugh.

684
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.587
TALIESIN: (coughs)
MARISHA: (slap)

685
00:30:14.587 --> 00:30:15.647
Ugh, bugs.

686
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.470
LAURA: No, they're not in here, don't worry about it.

687
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.348
TALIESIN: Oh, they're definitely in here.
LIAM: Dome's down.

688
00:30:19.348 --> 00:30:21.324
MARISHA: The dome's done.
LAURA: No!

689
00:30:22.257 --> 00:30:24.220
(groans)
MARISHA: Ugh.

690
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.630
LAURA: It's so much warmer here than I--

691
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.400
MARISHA: Everyone, drink water.

692
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.260
TRAVIS: Why?

693
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.050
MARISHA: Because it's hot and we've been sweating.

694
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.200
I'm drenched in-- are you drenched in sweat?

695
00:30:35.217 --> 00:30:38.290
TRAVIS: I'm actually quite cool.
MARISHA: Drink water.

696
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.082
SAM: I go to reach for my flask and it's not there.

697
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.015
ASHLEY: Whatcha reaching for?

698
00:30:45.015 --> 00:30:46.810
SAM: She said to drink.

699
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:47.820
MARISHA: Water.
ASHLEY: Water.

700
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.150
MARISHA: Water.
SAM: It's the same thing.

701
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.740
There's water in it. They use water to make it.

702
00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.267
LIAM: Here, here is my skin.
MARISHA: I toss--

703
00:30:53.267 --> 00:30:55.883
yeah, Caleb beats me.

704
00:30:55.883 --> 00:30:57.310
(laughter)

705
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.880
LIAM: Great minds.
ASHLEY: I open up the flask

706
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.773
and I start drinking.
SAM: (scoffs)

707
00:31:03.718 --> 00:31:05.850
(laughter)

708
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.210
MARISHA: Yasha. (snaps)
ASHLEY: Oh, did you want

709
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.050
some of this, too?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.090
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Thank you.

711
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.965
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's the most supportive thing--

712
00:31:11.965 --> 00:31:13.256
TALIESIN: This feels a little harsh.

713
00:31:13.256 --> 00:31:16.480
LAURA: Yeah, that's kind of harsh.
ASHLEY: You throw a person

714
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.120
into the deep end. Isn't the way you do it

715
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.950
and that's how they--
TALIESIN: If you're trying to

716
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.380
drown them, sure, you throw them into the deep end.

717
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.860
ASHLEY: Then you got to figure out how to swim.

718
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.340
MARISHA: I wasn't trying to prove any point,

719
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.960
I was just being super selfish.

720
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.120
TRAVIS: I don't think that hydrates you at all, though.

721
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.150
MARISHA: I already drank a bunch of water.

722
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.790
TRAVIS: Okay.
MARISHA: More than one.

723
00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.650
LIAM: What are we doing this morning?

724
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.517
LAURA: Oh yeah, where are we going?

725
00:31:40.363 --> 00:31:41.688
Do you know where we're going?

726
00:31:41.688 --> 00:31:43.960
LIAM: I can get us out of here if we want to go now.

727
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.159
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right because that was

728
00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:48.107
the whole point of sleeping.
LAURA: Wait, go where?

729
00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:51.555
LIAM: Well, we could leave and head back to a city or--

730
00:31:51.555 --> 00:31:53.214
LAURA: No, we're going to--
LIAM: --we are traveling on--

731
00:31:53.214 --> 00:31:54.980
TALIESIN: We're on our way.
LIAM: Yeah.

732
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.146
You ready?

733
00:31:56.146 --> 00:31:59.021
TALIESIN: Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

734
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:00.634
LAURA: Wait, before we go,

735
00:32:00.634 --> 00:32:05.070
I have to pray to the Traveler...

736
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:06.100
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: ...to--

737
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.000
SAM: You do that, you pray daily now?

738
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.795
LAURA: Well yeah, I-- it's how I decide--

739
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.570
he helps me figure out what I'm going to do for the day.

740
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.060
TRAVIS: She draws a dick on a tree or something, I mean--

741
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.380
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to go carve a dick on a tree.

742
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.850
SAM: Oh okay, well you should have just said that.

743
00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.895
LAURA: And say: Hey, Traveler,

744
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.980
we're going to get going.

745
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.960
We had some breakfast and I'm going to carve this dick.

746
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.862
(laughter)

747
00:32:32.862 --> 00:32:33.730
MARISHA: All right, while you carve that,

748
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.430
50 push ups, let's go.

749
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.821
TRAVIS: Fucking ... all right.
MARISHA: Yeah, come on.

750
00:32:37.821 --> 00:32:39.790
MATT: You guys power through your push ups

751
00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.290
before you begin to hear this dull cracking sound.

752
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.910
Right as Jester finishes her carving of the dick

753
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:50.910
on the side of a jungle tree, you hear (cracking)

754
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.940
as the outside of the tree begins to splinter and split.

755
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.950
From the edges of this carved dick,

756
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.090
you see flowers begin to bloom and erupt from it,

757
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.120
vines begin to suddenly start shifting out of it

758
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.750
at a rapid pace and swirling around,

759
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.170
encapsulating a large majority of this clearing

760
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.070
you guys have been sleeping in,

761
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.170
the fallen rotted log that you had

762
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.870
set yourself to rest against

763
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.350
being swallowed by these vines

764
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.220
as flowers of all colors begin to permeate.

765
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.080
The scent of the air immediately begins to change

766
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:27.080
to a very welcoming, bakery-like aroma.

767
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.480
You can see glowing fireflies

768
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.230
beginning to tangle through and swirl.

769
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.330
The wind becomes cool

770
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.450
and sends a chill through your back.

771
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.523
It's alarming, but you feel comfortable.

772
00:33:40.523 --> 00:33:43.370
LAURA: Praise be!
SAM: What is happening?

773
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.030
What is this?
TALIESIN: Well, this is a bit weird.

774
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.640
SAM: Did you do this?
LAURA: The Traveler

775
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.124
has made his presence known!

776
00:33:49.124 --> 00:33:51.600
(laughter)

777
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.540
MATT: You watch as the dick suddenly begins to fold into--

778
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.990
LIAM: Oh dear.
MATT: That's the base of--

779
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.360
MARISHA: Oh god.
MATT: To fold into the tree

780
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.060
and become a doorway--
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

781
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.450
MATT: A small doorway that grows in size.

782
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.891
LAURA: He travels!
LIAM: The base grows?

783
00:34:04.891 --> 00:34:06.238
(yelling)
(laughter)

784
00:34:06.238 --> 00:34:07.520
TRAVIS: It certainly made a dick hole.

785
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.394
LAURA: He travels everywhere.

786
00:34:09.394 --> 00:34:12.694
To and fro, he travels great distances--

787
00:34:12.694 --> 00:34:14.202
SAM: Why are you talking like that?
LAURA: --because he is a god.

788
00:34:14.202 --> 00:34:16.798
MATT: A bright teal-ish light begins to emerge

789
00:34:16.798 --> 00:34:19.390
from this carved hole in the center

790
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:23.260
that opens up into an arched gateway.

791
00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.676
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: Now that is a urethra.

792
00:34:25.676 --> 00:34:27.290
(laughter, groans)

793
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.620
MATT: And stepping from it, you see, to you,

794
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.080
and a handful of you in glimpses,

795
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.654
a familiar green robed figure. (footsteps)

796
00:34:37.654 --> 00:34:39.682
(birds calling in background)

797
00:34:39.682 --> 00:34:43.080
TRAVIS: A few steps back.
LAURA: I get down and kneel and--

798
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.853
SAM: Is this...?

799
00:34:45.853 --> 00:34:47.094
LAURA: This is the Traveler, Nott!

800
00:34:47.094 --> 00:34:49.020
SAM: I know, but--
MATT: The hand reaches out

801
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.395
and touches the top of Jester's head.

802
00:34:52.268 --> 00:34:55.068
"Thank you, my acolyte."

803
00:34:55.068 --> 00:34:55.901
SAM: Oh.

804
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.290
MATT: "Hello."
LAURA: Everybody say hi

805
00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.100
to the Traveler.
LIAM: Hi, hello.

806
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.590
TALIESIN: How you doing?
LAURA: He's a god.

807
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.830
So he's really cool.
MARISHA: 'Sup?

808
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.100
MATT: "Friends of Jester, you've traveled

809
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.510
"and kept her safe and for that, I am thankful.

810
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.440
"We are on the cusp of a grand event, one that

811
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.340
"Jester may need your aid in."
SAM: Oh.

812
00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:25.830
LAURA: Should we just tell them?
TRAVIS: Understood.

813
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:27.010
MATT: "Should we just?"
LAURA: Should we just

814
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.510
tell them now?
MATT: "If you want--"

815
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.110
LAURA: I mean, you can tell them--
MATT: "Okay."

816
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.130
SAM: What's happening?

817
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.040
What is this?
MARISHA: Jes?

818
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.930
LAURA: So there's something really awesome

819
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.150
happening that I just found out about.

820
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:45.022
Um, the Traveler is

821
00:35:45.022 --> 00:35:47.670
not actually a god-god god.

822
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.810
SAM: I'm sorry?
LAURA: But he's, like,

823
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.332
a mostly-god god?
MARISHA: Right.

824
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.102
I go up and I touch him.

825
00:35:54.102 --> 00:35:55.881
(laughter)

826
00:35:55.881 --> 00:35:57.130
I start doing this.
MATT: "Whoa, whoa."

827
00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.200
He gets pushed back a bit and puts a hand up,

828
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.630
just as a reaction, and the vines around,

829
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.680
wrap around your arm and hold it in place.

830
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.850
MARISHA: Can I monk parry him?
LAURA: You're going to,

831
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.640
he's a god!
MARISHA: I just want to touch him.

832
00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.500
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

833
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.820
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

834
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.490
MARISHA: Where are all my D20s?

835
00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:18.035
LAURA: I'm jumping up and trying to get between them.

836
00:36:18.035 --> 00:36:19.171
MARISHA: Where are my d20s?

837
00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:21.967
(laughter)

838
00:36:21.967 --> 00:36:24.292
Okay, dexterity saving throw?
MATT: Correct.

839
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.983
MARISHA: Okay.

840
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.800
22.
MATT: 22.

841
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.810
The vines, shh, come out towards you

842
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.370
and in slow motion, as they're about to

843
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.790
wrap around your wrists, you ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch

844
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:38.794
pull your arm out and then, snaps shut and he goes, "Shit."

845
00:36:38.794 --> 00:36:40.769
MARISHA: I turn around. Yeah, not a god.

846
00:36:40.769 --> 00:36:44.204
LAURA: Hey, I said he's a a mostly-god, not a god-god.

847
00:36:44.204 --> 00:36:46.600
Okay, so here's the thing, I'm realizing now.

848
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.420
Maybe at Traveler Con, you don't appear in the flesh.

849
00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.728
Like, you just should not appear.

850
00:36:50.728 --> 00:36:52.220
SAM: What the fuck is going on?

851
00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.053
What are you talking about?

852
00:36:53.053 --> 00:36:55.150
LAURA: You should always be, like, bigger, right?

853
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.570
Because I think, like, if you're here as a person--

854
00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.620
MATT: You watch as the Traveler's form

855
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.459
suddenly swells to about 15 feet tall,

856
00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:05.111
the boughs cracking above him.

857
00:37:05.111 --> 00:37:06.610
(groans) "I didn't think this through."

858
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.090
TRAVIS: Yes, maybe not, maybe back to normal size

859
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.530
for the introduction, maybe.

860
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.190
TALIESIN: Maybe come back down here, friend.

861
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.910
MATT: "(deeper) Is this too much?"
TALIESIN: It's a little much.

862
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.026
TRAVIS: Oh, god, jeez.

863
00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:18.850
MATT: "I am the Tr-- ugh." He pulls the hood back

864
00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.910
and sits on his knees (laughs) and goes (sighs).

865
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.530
Yeah, like huge fucking knees,

866
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.270
he's consuming half of this open space now,

867
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.710
the vines still around, there's still glittering firebugs,

868
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.650
but now he's just this sitting giant

869
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.820
with the bright mane of orange hair,

870
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.510
the elongated fey ears, the fine pointed features.

871
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.780
LAURA: I go up and pat his calf, that's probably about as--

872
00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.200
MATT: He puts a hand down.

873
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.680
LAURA: I climb on his hand.

874
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.660
LIAM: Jester, to what do we owe this visitation

875
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.390
after so many months with you?

876
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.210
LAURA: Well, Traveler Con's coming up, right?

877
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.510
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>
TRAVIS: Sure.

878
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.480
LAURA: And we got to figure out a way to make, you know,

879
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.650
all the other people attending Traveler Con

880
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:03.320
not have to talk to him as much.

881
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.428
Because it's annoying.

882
00:38:04.428 --> 00:38:06.590
SAM: What does that mean? What do you mean?

883
00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.098
TRAVIS: Ah, this is a lot. Okay, so--

884
00:38:09.098 --> 00:38:12.010
SAM: Wait. First of all, who is this guy?

885
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:13.550
LAURA: Well, this is the Traveler.

886
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.880
SAM: But you said that the Traveler

887
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.880
was a god who's been with you forever

888
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.790
and whose faith you put, you follow--

889
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.430
LAURA: Yeah, okay, so here's the thing:

890
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.510
I was thinking about it a lot last night

891
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.320
and I don't remember you ever telling me

892
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.465
you actually were a god, so I can't--
MATT: "No."

893
00:38:29.465 --> 00:38:31.188
LAURA: -- totally blame you for this.

894
00:38:31.188 --> 00:38:35.890
MATT: "It was kind of an assumption
I wasn't quick to correct."

895
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.050
LAURA: I just--
MATT: "It felt nice."

896
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.100
SAM: No, but you--
ASHLEY: You just

897
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.410
told her all of this last night?

898
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.750
You thought this whole time--

899
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.200
LAURA: That he--
MATT: "Is this a bad idea?

900
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.000
"Should I go?"
LAURA: No, stay please.

901
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.030
LIAM: We have heard so much about you.

902
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.150
LAURA: See?

903
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.890
MATT: "I've heard a few things about you."

904
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.190
MARISHA: I saw you in Asarius.

905
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.450
Did you see me or was that a mistake?

906
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.420
Was I not supposed to see you?

907
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.880
MATT: "I was probably running--"
MARISHA: Were you drunk?

908
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.150
MATT: "Towards the end of my--"
MARISHA: You were drunk.

909
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.543
MATT: "-- end of my threads.

910
00:39:06.543 --> 00:39:07.834
"I was not drunk, I was tired."

911
00:39:07.834 --> 00:39:10.564
MARISHA: Okay, that checks out.
LIAM: If we may be so bold--

912
00:39:10.564 --> 00:39:11.397
MATT: "Yes?"

913
00:39:11.397 --> 00:39:14.020
LIAM: You're an almost-god, is this what you would

914
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.877
refer to yourself as, as an almost-god?

915
00:39:16.877 --> 00:39:19.998
MATT: "Um." He sets Jester down a bit.

916
00:39:19.998 --> 00:39:21.186
LAURA: (giggling)

917
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.980
MATT: "I am an unaffiliated

918
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.637
"what you would call an archfey."

919
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.180
SAM: What does that mean?

920
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.430
MARISHA: Arch--
SAM: Arch means evil, doesn't it?

921
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.160
MARISHA: Unaffiliated--
SAM: Like an arch-nemesis?

922
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.980
TALIESIN: Sort of half a circle.
LAURA: No, no.

923
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.180
SAM: Arch-rival? It's only used in bad things.

924
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.170
MATT: "It means greater--"
ASHLEY: Like the arch you just made.

925
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.960
LIAM: Great or grand.
SAM: Oh, okay.

926
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.150
LIAM: More than.

927
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:51.310
MATT: "I can do many things,

928
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.217
"but I am not a god,

929
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.840
"and I've been enjoying helping people.

930
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.420
"I've helped Jester for the better part of two decades now,

931
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.780
"I think it is, and in doing so, I think I've helped

932
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.672
"all of you quite a bit."

933
00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:09.497
SAM: But, just to be clear,

934
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.700
you're not a god.

935
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.625
I thought you were a-- I thought you were a,

936
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.220
a holy magician, a holy mage.

937
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.330
LIAM: I think he is more like this. (snaps)

938
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.070
Frumpkin appears on the ground.

939
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.880
MATT: "Ah. (chuckles)"
SAM: But not him, her.

940
00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.540
MARISHA: Yeah, where do you get your powers from, then?

941
00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.610
LAURA: From him.
MATT: "Oh, that's also from me."

942
00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.176
MARISHA: But you're not a--

943
00:40:37.176 --> 00:40:38.084
MATT: "Oh, do you think

944
00:40:38.084 --> 00:40:39.980
"gods are the only entities that can

945
00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.370
"grant their essence and powers to lesser beings?

946
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.910
"What do you think demonic entities make choices with?

947
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:49.080
"I can already sense some dark deals in your

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.340
"half-orc friend here."
TRAVIS: Thank you.

949
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.430
MARISHA: No, I just think it gives a

950
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.650
little bit more credit to her, that's all.

951
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.490
MATT: "Oh, all credit goes to her, she's amazing.

952
00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.830
"But just know just because I'm not a god

953
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.920
"doesn't mean that I'm not trustworthy

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.367
"or important or capable or a friend."

955
00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:09.070
LAURA: He could kill all of us right now if he wanted to.

956
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.320
MATT: "I actually really could, it'd be very easy.

957
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.586
"But I'm not going to do that

958
00:41:12.586 --> 00:41:15.177
"because that's not interesting, that's not fun."

959
00:41:15.177 --> 00:41:17.040
LIAM: What are you here to do?

960
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.015
MATT: "Find things that are interesting and have fun."

961
00:41:19.015 --> 00:41:20.231
TALIESIN: Huh.
LAURA: What if,

962
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:21.764
oh my god, ultimate trick?

963
00:41:21.764 --> 00:41:22.937
MATT: "Mm-hmm?"

964
00:41:22.937 --> 00:41:25.960
LAURA: You don't show up to Traveler Con?

965
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.855
What if everybody gets there and you don't come?

966
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.976
MATT: "I mean--"

967
00:41:34.002 --> 00:41:35.350
LAURA: That'd be pretty great.

968
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.240
MATT: "It's a pretty good trick.

969
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.320
"Oh, so many angry people."
LAURA: I know, I know, I know.

970
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.778
MATT: "Are you okay with dealing
with that kind of customer support?"

971
00:41:44.778 --> 00:41:45.611
LAURA: Well--

972
00:41:45.611 --> 00:41:47.940
MATT: "Because if so, I'm all about it."

973
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.773
LAURA: (cackles)

974
00:41:48.773 --> 00:41:51.260
TRAVIS: You seem very forthright.

975
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.170
To follow up on my friend's question,

976
00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:56.140
what is it that you do want?

977
00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.230
Besides to have fun.

978
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.771
Any particular goal?

979
00:41:59.771 --> 00:42:00.604
MATT: "Not really.

980
00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:02.890
"When you've lived as long as I have, you just,

981
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.930
"good, bad, it all blends together.

982
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:07.763
"It's about

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:13.740
"keeping things interesting, fluid, weird."

984
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.620
LAURA: If the gods think of it, your, you know,

985
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:23.300
acting like a god, can they get mad at you?

986
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.510
MATT: "Do I care?"
LAURA: I don't know.

987
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:32.710
MATT: "(hums) I think it depends on the god in particular.

988
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.300
"I'm not doing anything to bother any of them directly.

989
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.980
"It's not like they can do much, they're all locked away

990
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.810
"in their little ethereal closets on the

991
00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:41.910
"other side of the Gate."

992
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.780
LIAM: Are they aware of you?

993
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.840
MATT: "I'm sure they're aware of me."

994
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.240
LIAM: Frumpkin the little capuchin monkey starts climbing up

995
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.390
his ropes and up into his hair and swinging about.

996
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:52.730
MATT: He doesn't even, he acknowledges

997
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.430
with his eyes, but just lets it go.

998
00:42:55.277 --> 00:42:58.130
ASHLEY: Do you have a lot of followers?

999
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.950
LAURA: Oh yeah, how many people are going to meet up?

1000
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.920
MATT: "Maybe about

1001
00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.653
"two, a little over 200."

1002
00:43:06.653 --> 00:43:08.561
LAURA: 200!

1003
00:43:08.561 --> 00:43:10.050
That's so many more than I thought.

1004
00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.820
I was thinking, like, not that many.

1005
00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.250
TRAVIS: Jester, that seems like a
rather small number, actually.

1006
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.175
I thought--

1007
00:43:17.175 --> 00:43:20.758
MATT: "It's a very curated
circle of individuals, thank you."

1008
00:43:20.758 --> 00:43:25.190
TALIESIN: I've seen this face before on other people.

1009
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:26.730
LAURA: What are you talking about?

1010
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.280
TALIESIN: Oh man, you don't know what you're doing, do you?

1011
00:43:31.582 --> 00:43:32.865
MATT: "I like him."

1012
00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:35.631
LAURA: He's the one that listens to the wind.

1013
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:37.514
TALIESIN: Yeah. What?

1014
00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:39.547
MATT: "I can smell her on you."

1015
00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.538
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

1016
00:43:43.538 --> 00:43:45.513
MATT: "She's boorish, but I like her color scheme and style,

1017
00:43:45.513 --> 00:43:46.579
"it's fine."

1018
00:43:46.579 --> 00:43:48.137
TALIESIN: Caught half of that.

1019
00:43:48.137 --> 00:43:50.027
MARISHA: I thought that was mushrooms.

1020
00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:54.267
MATT: "(sniffs) It is mushrooms, very acute."

1021
00:43:54.267 --> 00:43:55.642
MARISHA: Thanks?

1022
00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.370
MATT: "Anyway."
ASHLEY: Feels like

1023
00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:02.897
if you have this con or whatever,

1024
00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.830
that a volcano is too large of a venue.

1025
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.940
TRAVIS: For 200 people.
ASHLEY: Fits a lot of people.

1026
00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.870
SAM: It doesn't have to take up the whole volcano,

1027
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:13.886
right?
LAURA: Well, what is the--

1028
00:44:13.886 --> 00:44:14.925
TALIESIN: Depends on the size of the volcano.

1029
00:44:14.925 --> 00:44:16.955
LAURA: I mean, it's not like we're going to be, like,

1030
00:44:16.955 --> 00:44:18.710
in the middle of the volcano, are we?

1031
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.510
That seems dangerous.

1032
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:21.618
MARISHA: Beach party.

1033
00:44:21.618 --> 00:44:22.960
LIAM: And I think they are preaching

1034
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.390
exclusivity here, is what it sounds like.

1035
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.390
Yeah?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:29.010
We're the elite.

1037
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.230
Everyone at the Traveler Con, we can make everybody

1038
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.100
think that, you know, only they were invited.

1039
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.810
There's a lot more Traveler followers out there.

1040
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.040
MATT: "That is viable."
LAURA: Yeah.

1041
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.620
MATT: "The chosen few."
LAURA: Exactly.

1042
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.830
LIAM: The goal of Traveler Con,

1043
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.790
besides being new and exciting,

1044
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:47.720
is to perhaps launch your faith to a greater reach?

1045
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.720
LAURA: That is a good point.
MATT: "The opposite.

1046
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.460
"It's to disengage a bit.

1047
00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.210
"Let them find each other and

1048
00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.416
"not bother me as much."

1049
00:45:00.416 --> 00:45:01.516
LAURA: Yeah, so the goal

1050
00:45:01.516 --> 00:45:04.650
is to make everybody believe that, you know,

1051
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.810
he's too powerful to be, like, as present in their lives.

1052
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:12.600
So we have to show them that he's, you know,

1053
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.290
that's not how you're supposed to pray to him,

1054
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:17.790
that he answers miracles in different ways.

1055
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.950
MARISHA: How are you going to do that with exclusivity?

1056
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.380
LAURA: The--
MARISHA: That feels like a clash.

1057
00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.180
LAURA: Well then, they can go out and spread the word

1058
00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:30.180
and let everyone know that this is how the Traveler works.

1059
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.340
TRAVIS: You're hosting a dinner party or a mixer,

1060
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.900
but with no guest of honor.

1061
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.410
MARISHA: With very high profile guests.

1062
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:39.880
MATT: "There's a particular word, I think,

1063
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.660
"that deals specifically with this

1064
00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.490
"that's been very prevalent through much of mortal history.

1065
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.480
"The word is faith

1066
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.680
"and it means giving everything

1067
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.700
"and expecting, and receiving, honestly,

1068
00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.660
"in the realms of religion, very little in return."

1069
00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.360
MARISHA: Well, it's a cult.

1070
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.360
LAURA: Well--
MARISHA: That's a cult.

1071
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.101
LAURA: No, no no, that's faith.

1072
00:46:04.101 --> 00:46:06.280
LIAM: It's a thin line.
MARISHA: Mm.

1073
00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.700
Wait, wait, okay, hang on, wait.

1074
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.240
We're doing way too much planning

1075
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.400
and there are other questions--

1076
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.590
SAM: Yeah, there's other questions first.

1077
00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.890
MARISHA: Hang on.
SAM: You said that

1078
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:19.300
you're in this for the lulz a little bit.

1079
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.010
You just,

1080
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.670
you just want to make fun and trickery and stuff.

1081
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:26.830
What happens if my friend Jessie

1082
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.690
says no or you grow bored of her?

1083
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.460
You told us that you could kill us.

1084
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.830
Is she in danger?

1085
00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:36.163
Does she have to follow you?

1086
00:46:36.163 --> 00:46:39.270
MATT: "She doesn't have to."

1087
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.410
LIAM: You want to abandon these--
LAURA: I wouldn't abandon you,

1088
00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:42.920
I love you.
MATT: "I know you wouldn't."

1089
00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.470
SAM: Oh, okay. What about us, though?

1090
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.770
If we don't say yes, are you going to kill us?

1091
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.050
MATT: "I'm not going to kill you
unless you give me a reason to."

1092
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.430
SAM: Well, if we say no to this Traveler--

1093
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.290
LAURA: That's not a good reason and he knows I love you all.

1094
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.330
LIAM: Well, I think in this instance,

1095
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.610
we are just concerned for our friend, Jester.

1096
00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.400
The other 199 or what have you, we do not know them.

1097
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.290
But are you with her for the long haul?

1098
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.860
Because she has great faith in you, we have heard.

1099
00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.860
MATT: "And I would never let that faith down."

1100
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:10.688
MARISHA: Insight check.

1101
00:47:10.688 --> 00:47:12.294
MATT: Make an insight check.

1102
00:47:12.294 --> 00:47:15.755
LIAM and LAURA: Check-ah.

1103
00:47:15.755 --> 00:47:17.880
MARISHA: Oh god, it's terrible.

1104
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.820
Eight, no, nine.
MATT: Nine?

1105
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.260
TRAVIS: Big mortal balls.
MARISHA: Horrible, horrible.

1106
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.980
MATT: There is such a presence of personality

1107
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.800
and slick, in spite of your prickly nature--

1108
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.670
MARISHA: Fuck, he's good.
MATT: -- a likable quality to him

1109
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:37.509
that you have no idea.

1110
00:47:37.509 --> 00:47:39.878
MARISHA: Okay, keep going, keep going.

1111
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.430
SAM: All right, I guess I feel slightly more relieved

1112
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.900
that you're not intending to harm any of us.

1113
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.470
But backing up to the Traveler Con a bit,

1114
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:55.460
your plan is to get 200 people together

1115
00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.160
and just trick them with--
LAURA: Well, we, okay,

1116
00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.440
here is the thing: we have to figure it out, okay?

1117
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.930
It's a lot of pressure.
SAM: Okay,

1118
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.600
I am not the best one to speak to this.

1119
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.720
Caduceus, I feel, is.

1120
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.690
But I feel like if you're going to

1121
00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:09.110
establish a group that's supposed to

1122
00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.050
support each other or be there for each other,

1123
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.580
you need to give them something,

1124
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.190
and I'm not talking about an object or money or anything,

1125
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.680
like, something to be faithful in,

1126
00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.638
a set of guidelines, presets.

1127
00:48:20.638 --> 00:48:22.396
LAURA: Yeah, that's what we got to figure out, right?

1128
00:48:22.396 --> 00:48:26.090
SAM: Something to follow, a code, right?

1129
00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.820
LIAM: Credo or a manifesto--
LAURA: But that's what the whole

1130
00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.300
point of Traveler is to not have that, we just--

1131
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.040
TALIESIN: You need a story.
SAM: Thank you, Caduceus.

1132
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.265
MATT: "A story."

1133
00:48:37.265 --> 00:48:39.458
MARISHA: Yeah, like what do you believe in, man?

1134
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:40.291
MATT: "Heh."

1135
00:48:40.291 --> 00:48:41.630
SAM: What do you want the world to be?

1136
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:44.700
TALIESIN: When people talk about you,
what do you want them to say?

1137
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.510
MARISHA: Yeah, what are your adjectives?

1138
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.860
LAURA: This would actually help me a lot

1139
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.100
because I am very bad at this.

1140
00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.160
SAM: She has been describing you to people in pamphlets,

1141
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.980
I'm sure you've seen them, as a really cool guy--

1142
00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.560
LAURA: Have you seen the pamphlets?

1143
00:48:57.499 --> 00:48:59.400
MATT: "I have not seen any of these pamphlets,

1144
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.984
"show me."
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I have to get my bag.

1145
00:49:00.984 --> 00:49:03.370
Here.
SAM: They say that you're--

1146
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.110
MATT: This gargantuan body holding this tiny pamphlet.

1147
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.600
SAM: -- a really cool guy who does really cool things.

1148
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.790
MARISHA: And you're super powerful.

1149
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:11.402
MATT: "This is ridiculous, I'm sorry."

1150
00:49:11.402 --> 00:49:14.700
(blows) With that, there's a swirl of greenish-blue

1151
00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.540
and he's back to a regular, though still

1152
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.630
taller than most of you, form.

1153
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.830
He's looking at the pamphlet.

1154
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:21.955
LIAM: Frumpkin's sitting on his shoulder.

1155
00:49:21.955 --> 00:49:24.290
MATT: "Hm, this is quite good.

1156
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:25.630
"The artistic--"
LAURA: I know.

1157
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.480
MATT: "-- details on this.

1158
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.690
"In the margins as well?"
LAURA: Thank you.

1159
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:30.623
SAM: Yeah, but, I mean,

1160
00:49:30.623 --> 00:49:33.420
this pamphlet, while amazingly designed

1161
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.050
and beautiful--
LAURA: Thank you.

1162
00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:38.800
SAM: I don't feel it's a, it's not something that

1163
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.350
your followers would carry around

1164
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:42.440
and be like, "Have you read this book?"

1165
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.240
You know, it's not, it doesn't have that heft to it,

1166
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.720
right?
MATT: "Here's the thing.

1167
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.550
"You asked me what I want.

1168
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.790
"That's a hard question to ask me, I've wanted many things.

1169
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.510
"I've gained many and grown bored

1170
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.290
"and I've forgotten some and not cared.

1171
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.500
"What matters is what I want right now.

1172
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.465
"And I think what I want right now

1173
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.608
"is to successfully

1174
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.340
"continue

1175
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:11.663
"to build a religious cult--"

1176
00:50:11.663 --> 00:50:13.116
LAURA: (groaning)

1177
00:50:13.116 --> 00:50:17.974
(laughter)

1178
00:50:19.403 --> 00:50:21.007
MATT: "-- where only--

1179
00:50:21.007 --> 00:50:23.810
(laughter)

1180
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:27.490
"-- where only you and I

1181
00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:30.915
"and the rest of us know the truth

1182
00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.319
"because my, what a trick that would be."

1183
00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:38.304
LAURA: It's pretty great.
MATT: "It's pretty great."

1184
00:50:38.304 --> 00:50:40.350
MARISHA: Oh no.
LIAM: They're inventing Sea Org.

1185
00:50:41.191 --> 00:50:42.024
TALIESIN: I am so conflicted.

1186
00:50:42.024 --> 00:50:44.549
SAM: Okay. I mean, first off,

1187
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:50.480
maybe use club instead, club or organization.

1188
00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:52.680
LAURA: Religion.

1189
00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.800
MATT: "Well, outwardly, yes.

1190
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.410
"I just thought it was a fun term already thrown out."

1191
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.360
MARISHA: Super fun.
LIAM: I am also sensing

1192
00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.640
a theme of more of a rejection of norms and

1193
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.100
structure--
MATT: "Yes."

1194
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:13.100
LIAM: So perhaps the message is
throwing off the shackles of--

1195
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.420
SAM: Conformity.
LIAM: Of conformity, tradition.

1196
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.610
MATT: "Responsibility."
LIAM: Yeah, hedonistic.

1197
00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.720
MARISHA: Chaos Crew.

1198
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.653
TRAVIS: Well.
SAM: Chaos Crew.

1199
00:51:20.653 --> 00:51:22.280
LAURA: Chaos Crew.

1200
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.914
SAM: No one can see this over here.

1201
00:51:24.914 --> 00:51:26.520
MARISHA, SAM, and LAURA: Chaos Crew.

1202
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.750
TRAVIS: So your objective is to have fun and not to

1203
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.640
achieve some sort of tax-exempt status, correct?

1204
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:37.250
SAM: The third one's silent? (laughs)

1205
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:41.297
MATT: "I have no interest in monetary gain,

1206
00:51:43.116 --> 00:51:44.900
"if that's what you're inquiring about."

1207
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:51.585
TRAVIS: I mean, if no one's getting (sighs) hurt.

1208
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.550
LAURA: I bought enough fabric so all of us

1209
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.490
can be high priests at Traveler Con.

1210
00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.650
MARISHA: Should we sidebar for a minute?

1211
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.930
MATT: "People being tricked is fun.

1212
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:09.710
"Extremely shitty people being tricked

1213
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.330
"is so much more fun

1214
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.810
"and there are so many shitty people

1215
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:19.540
"just waiting to be tricked."

1216
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.485
MARISHA: Yeah, you know--
LAURA: That's true--

1217
00:52:21.485 --> 00:52:23.753
ASHLEY: I--
LAURA: What?

1218
00:52:23.753 --> 00:52:24.802
TRAVIS: Yeah?

1219
00:52:24.802 --> 00:52:25.818
MARISHA: Go, Yasha.

1220
00:52:25.818 --> 00:52:29.980
ASHLEY: I think I'm just confused about

1221
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.938
how

1222
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.280
I feel like you've been tricking Jester.

1223
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.040
I'm just, if that's part of your thing,

1224
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.623
I don't know how I feel about that, you know?

1225
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.970
MATT: "Not intentionally.

1226
00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.100
"I understand where your concern lies,

1227
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.370
"but have you found yourself trusting

1228
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.820
"and caring for other people and yet

1229
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:58.655
"keeping things secret to yourself to keep them safe?

1230
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:01.890
"To make them feel comfortable?"

1231
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:03.131
TRAVIS: He's good.

1232
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:05.180
ASHLEY: Yes.

1233
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:09.260
I feel like that's different, but yes.

1234
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.990
MATT: "I didn't intend for this to be what it was,

1235
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:15.380
"but it was this young girl's

1236
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:19.890
"joy and faith in me that brought me on this path.

1237
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.378
"If anything, she tricked me."

1238
00:53:21.378 --> 00:53:23.569
LAURA: (laughs)

1239
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:26.622
I mean, you gave me a lot of powers, you know?

1240
00:53:26.622 --> 00:53:28.687
MATT: "I like being helpful."
LAURA: He didn't lie about that.

1241
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.160
MARISHA: So you want to--
MATT: "They're still

1242
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.570
"scrubbing the paint from that temple, by the way."

1243
00:53:36.229 --> 00:53:38.725
TRAVIS: Oh yes.
LAURA: They were so mad.

1244
00:53:38.725 --> 00:53:41.050
MATT: "Oh, I can tell."

1245
00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:43.140
MARISHA: You don't want to deal with the

1246
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.387
day-to-day struggles of being a god,

1247
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.443
you want to retire--

1248
00:53:50.443 --> 00:53:53.052
MATT: "Why do you think the gods
went behind the Divine Gate?

1249
00:53:53.052 --> 00:53:56.650
"Because it was to preserve the things they created?

1250
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:59.520
"Because of the damage of the Calamity? No!

1251
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.170
"They got bored of having to do

1252
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:02.800
"the bidding of every mortal at their feet

1253
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.490
"and they left to take vacation forever

1254
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:07.388
"and occasionally send a bit of power their way."

1255
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:09.600
LIAM: Well, you know,

1256
00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.030
the lot of us certainly trust Jester completely

1257
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:17.630
and

1258
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:21.500
we also know a great many shitty people.

1259
00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.520
I wonder if we help create the best

1260
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.150
Traveler Con that ever was, if maybe we could

1261
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:32.600
make it a full circle and you could help us with

1262
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.600
some of those shitty people.
MATT: "Oh, I already have been."

1263
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.180
LIAM: We know, we have seen it.

1264
00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.380
MATT: "As long as you have her around,
you'll have me around."

1265
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.270
LIAM: Well, we would have to put on a very good show, then.

1266
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:49.010
MARISHA: Here's the thing, though.
LAURA: No theater.

1267
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:51.080
MARISHA: I'm kind of, I'm kind of--
MATT: "No, absolutely not."

1268
00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.221
MARISHA: -- with Yasha.

1269
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.360
Those things have repercussions on a grander scale.

1270
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.130
LIAM: Which bits?
MARISHA: Sometimes, if you trick

1271
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:05.100
dumb, stupid, idiotic people,

1272
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.150
it informs the rest of their lives.

1273
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.220
LIAM: But I am not talking about dumb, idiotic people.

1274
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.211
I am talking about the most intelligent,

1275
00:55:12.211 --> 00:55:16.110
ruthless people in this world.

1276
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:18.110
TALIESIN: I mean, Beau's right.

1277
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:24.230
I was a big fan of practical jokes and, I mean--

1278
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.590
TRAVIS: You were?
MATT: "<i>You</i> were?"

1279
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:30.230
TALIESIN: Things could get out of
hand on occasion. It's been a while.

1280
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.950
MATT: "I knew I liked him."
TALIESIN: I mean,

1281
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.890
if things do get out of hand, it can be a problem.

1282
00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:39.920
I'm not going to speak more on the subject right now, but.

1283
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.950
MATT: "Well, you just don't know how to escape."

1284
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.430
LAURA: No, you just, you just have to bamf away.

1285
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:49.230
MATT: "It's only a problem if you
remain to be there for it."

1286
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:52.610
LAURA: You turn invisible, you run away, you Dimension Door.

1287
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.276
There's so many options.

1288
00:55:54.276 --> 00:55:56.190
TALIESIN: I'm not really a runner.

1289
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.380
LIAM: All I am saying--
MATT: "You don't have to run.

1290
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.988
"It could be just an easy step.

1291
00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:01.510
"I could show you a few tricks."
LIAM: All I am saying is this.

1292
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:05.210
And I cast Seeming and everyone is wearing green robes.

1293
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:07.973
LAURA: I didn't even have to buy the stupid fabric!

1294
00:56:07.973 --> 00:56:09.610
TALIESIN: (snorting)

1295
00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:11.650
MATT: You see a big smile curl across his face.

1296
00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:14.230
LIAM: We have done a great many great things together.

1297
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.870
LAURA: Make mine have more embroidery.

1298
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:18.167
LIAM: It has more embroidery.
LAURA: Yes!

1299
00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:20.417
(laughter)

1300
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.820
LIAM: I have no desire to harm innocent people,

1301
00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:30.200
but we could create something unique

1302
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:34.410
in a bit of life, you know, in a hard life.

1303
00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:37.760
We are in control of ourselves,

1304
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.260
we do not have to harm anyone

1305
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.160
unless they are people who deserve to be harmed.

1306
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.928
MARISHA: That is a super

1307
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:53.120
intense responsibility

1308
00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:59.070
and kind of requires a certain amount of ego to say that.

1309
00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:00.872
LIAM: Hello, my name is Caleb Widogast.

1310
00:57:00.872 --> 00:57:02.674
MARISHA: Nice to meet you, Caleb.

1311
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:08.410
TALIESIN: I don't know if I can subscribe to that, but

1312
00:57:09.656 --> 00:57:11.623
I owe Jester a great deal

1313
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:13.603
and

1314
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.075
it would be

1315
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.240
unconscionable not to help you

1316
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.920
with whatever path you're moving towards, either

1317
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.220
for the delight of crowds or

1318
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:31.665
to keep anything from getting out of hand.

1319
00:57:34.232 --> 00:57:37.455
SAM: I agree that,

1320
00:57:37.455 --> 00:57:41.720
I mean, I'm just here for Jester as well

1321
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.470
and if these people are going to

1322
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.952
come to the volcano and expect something,

1323
00:57:47.952 --> 00:57:49.940
I suppose it would be more fulfilling for them

1324
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.750
to get some sort of a show than to leave

1325
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:54.700
disappointed and empty.

1326
00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.640
LAURA: Yeah.

1327
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.640
SAM: But I still would like to, I'd prefer it if

1328
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.340
they were set up with some sort of

1329
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:06.910
path to success or happiness rather than just being

1330
00:58:08.308 --> 00:58:10.591
tricked for trickery's sake.

1331
00:58:10.591 --> 00:58:13.507
LAURA: Right. We want them to be happy, it--

1332
00:58:13.507 --> 00:58:15.630
it feels good to believe.

1333
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:18.600
SAM: Your belief in the Traveler
has helped you a great deal,

1334
00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.220
not just because he's bestowed upon you powers,

1335
00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:26.780
but also, he's given you friendship.

1336
00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:28.550
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: And it would be nice

1337
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:33.550
to give the other people at your con that same potential.

1338
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:37.790
MATT: He walks forward towards you, Jester, seeing the hints

1339
00:58:39.214 --> 00:58:41.050
of

1340
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:41.940
doubt and

1341
00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:47.020
small, cold trickle of sorrow

1342
00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:48.390
of the reality that you've been

1343
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:50.460
wrestling with since the evening.

1344
00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.710
He just reaches out and touches your chin and goes,

1345
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.190
"Words are just words.

1346
00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:00.470
"I'm what I've always been and what you've made me.

1347
00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:04.110
"This has not changed."
LAURA: Yeah.

1348
00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:07.240
MATT: "If anything, I trusted you with this

1349
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.880
"because of what we have.

1350
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.217
"I'm sorry if you're disappointed."

1351
00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:15.619
LAURA: No, I'm not.

1352
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.370
I guess I was just, you know,

1353
00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:29.650
I really did think you were always around

1354
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:32.270
and now, I feel like

1355
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.980
maybe that's asking a lot of you.

1356
00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.450
MATT: "(sighs) I think, if we pull this off,

1357
00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.410
"and if we do it right, we could leave

1358
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:55.120
"199 or so individuals

1359
00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.400
"still content, with new friends,

1360
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.420
"some defined direction, perhaps,

1361
01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:06.100
"in the way they go through their day-to-day

1362
01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.350
"as they slowly walk towards the days of dust,

1363
01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.200
"and I'll have more time to be around you."

1364
01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:18.676
LAURA: I like it.

1365
01:00:19.668 --> 01:00:21.051
MATT: "All right, then."

1366
01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:26.160
TRAVIS: If Jester has faith the Traveler,

1367
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.385
that's good enough for me, I suppose.

1368
01:00:30.909 --> 01:00:32.150
MARISHA: I agree.

1369
01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.928
I think, to Caduceus' point,

1370
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.911
<i>you're</i> the story.

1371
01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:42.894
LAURA: Huh?

1372
01:00:44.833 --> 01:00:46.959
TALIESIN: You're not wrong.
MARISHA: The Traveler needs a story.

1373
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:49.657
You're the story.
LIAM: Yeah,

1374
01:00:49.657 --> 01:00:51.840
you are the poster child.

1375
01:00:52.756 --> 01:00:55.958
MARISHA: He helped <i>you</i> first.

1376
01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:58.916
He changed <i>your</i> life.

1377
01:00:58.916 --> 01:00:59.970
LAURA: Yeah.

1378
01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:01.805
MARISHA: You're his story.

1379
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:06.659
Or, more like--
LAURA: I'll be the keynote speaker.

1380
01:01:06.659 --> 01:01:07.922
TALIESIN: (snorting)

1381
01:01:08.955 --> 01:01:11.190
MARISHA: I think it's more than that, but yeah.

1382
01:01:12.275 --> 01:01:13.616
Keynote speaker.

1383
01:01:13.616 --> 01:01:18.511
SAM: What is the story that you'll tell as the,

1384
01:01:18.511 --> 01:01:21.325
I mean, are you going to do a demonstration of

1385
01:01:21.325 --> 01:01:23.333
the gifts he's given you?

1386
01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:24.790
LAURA: Ooh!

1387
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:26.544
That could be pretty cool.

1388
01:01:26.544 --> 01:01:28.290
MATT: Not bad.
SAM: We could--

1389
01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:30.080
LAURA: You could make me seem even more powerful than I am.

1390
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.540
Like, Caleb, you could do some really cool stuff, right?

1391
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:37.540
SAM: Or what if you walked into there
just in tattered clothing

1392
01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:41.732
because you're just a peasant girl with nothing,

1393
01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:46.150
you're even feeble, your hands don't work

1394
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:47.890
or something like that?
LAURA: Yeah.

1395
01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:50.040
Ooh, I could have no hands!
SAM: No hands.

1396
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.470
Then, because of the Traveler, you can paint amazingly

1397
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:55.770
or something.
MATT: "Are you saying

1398
01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:58.270
"an organized religious event would fake

1399
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:00.750
"an individual's rise from a low place

1400
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.260
"to a high one for the purpose of

1401
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.520
"convincing the masses that there is a miracle?

1402
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.667
"Such a thing's never been done."

1403
01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:09.600
SAM: Did I just invent that?

1404
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.651
MARISHA and LIAM: Canon.

1405
01:02:10.651 --> 01:02:12.130
(laughter)

1406
01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:13.910
TALIESIN: I don't think that's what you want.

1407
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:16.120
MARISHA: I agree.
LAURA: Why?

1408
01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.480
TALIESIN: You want--
MARISHA: Your story's

1409
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.450
awesome already, don't,

1410
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.577
you can be a cleric of a trickery god,

1411
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.600
but don't fool them in faith.

1412
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.040
Tell them the truth.

1413
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.110
TALIESIN: You don't want liars.
LAURA: Then you fuck them a little bit

1414
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:39.764
because, I mean, that's just, you got to.
MARISHA: Yeah, you can after,

1415
01:02:39.764 --> 01:02:41.460
yeah--
TALIESIN: No, you want,

1416
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.190
you want storytellers, you want,

1417
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:47.700
you want showmanship,

1418
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.400
you want people who will

1419
01:02:52.391 --> 01:02:53.300
(sighs)

1420
01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.800
create,

1421
01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.630
create events, create art,

1422
01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:02.750
create things that people will see that will confound them.

1423
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:06.170
MATT: "To take this story
and then begin to share their own."

1424
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.920
TALIESIN: And you want to show them the truth.

1425
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.578
MATT: "Well."

1426
01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:11.420
TALIESIN: A certain truth.

1427
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.030
LAURA: They go back to their hometown

1428
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:18.230
and they set up a temple and they get followers there

1429
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.320
and then those followers get followers

1430
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.380
and then those followers get followers.

1431
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.900
That's how you build a religion.

1432
01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.400
TALIESIN: They have a word for people who do that already.

1433
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.710
They're called jesters.

1434
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:32.903
LAURA: What?

1435
01:03:33.763 --> 01:03:36.405
TALIESIN: The trickster who shows the truth.

1436
01:03:37.723 --> 01:03:38.657
I mean, how did you end up with

1437
01:03:38.657 --> 01:03:40.357
that name in the first place?

1438
01:03:43.307 --> 01:03:44.140
LAURA: Well,

1439
01:03:45.876 --> 01:03:48.080
I thought it sounded cool.

1440
01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.148
I thought jesters were people that made people laugh.

1441
01:03:51.148 --> 01:03:52.262
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: You thought that,

1442
01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:54.487
you chose your name?

1443
01:03:54.487 --> 01:03:56.040
LAURA: Well, yeah.

1444
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.150
TRAVIS: Your mother did not name you?

1445
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:59.800
LAURA: Well, she did, but she told me

1446
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.560
I get to choose my own name.

1447
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.550
SAM: What was your name used to be?

1448
01:04:05.224 --> 01:04:06.590
TALIESIN: I don't think tieflings--

1449
01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:08.580
do tieflings, there's a thing for--

1450
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.330
SAM: Did you have a name before this?

1451
01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:12.250
LIAM: What did your mother call you before Jester?

1452
01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.375
SAM: What was your mother's name?

1453
01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:16.033
(laughter)

1454
01:04:16.033 --> 01:04:17.947
LIAM and TALIESIN: For you.

1455
01:04:17.947 --> 01:04:18.780
SAM: For you.

1456
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.030
(laughter)

1457
01:04:23.675 --> 01:04:25.149
LAURA: Genevieve.

1458
01:04:25.149 --> 01:04:29.875
SAM: Genevieve?
MARISHA: (laughs) Genevieve? (laughs)

1459
01:04:30.862 --> 01:04:32.860
SAM: I mean.
TALIESIN: Perfectly reasonable.

1460
01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.240
SAM: Genny?
MARISHA: Sorry.

1461
01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.260
TRAVIS: I think that's lovely.
TALIESIN: I do too.

1462
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:40.750
LAURA: I like Jester, okay? Jester, jeez.

1463
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.857
MATT: "It's a much better name."
MARISHA: Can I call you Genny?

1464
01:04:42.857 --> 01:04:45.973
LAURA: No, you can call me Jester.

1465
01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:47.657
SAM: Genevieve Lavore?

1466
01:04:47.657 --> 01:04:49.220
TALIESIN: I think the point is that

1467
01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.620
you should be what people aspire to.

1468
01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.227
We shouldn't have to trick people about you, you should be

1469
01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:59.430
elevated, you should be the success.

1470
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:05.540
You are everything a disciple of the Traveler should be.

1471
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:09.288
No sense to lie about that.

1472
01:05:10.635 --> 01:05:13.530
LIAM: I think you just show who you are on a grand scale,

1473
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:17.146
which is pretty grand already.

1474
01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:19.260
LAURA: Sheesh, you guys.

1475
01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.910
I feel pretty great right now. (sighs)

1476
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.430
TRAVIS: You could still add to your story, though.

1477
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:25.320
Maybe an evil wizard tried to kill you

1478
01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.500
when you were a baby and the curse rebounded

1479
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.252
and left a scar on your forehead and--

1480
01:05:30.252 --> 01:05:31.219
no? Okay.

1481
01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:32.850
Scratch this.
MATT: "No one will buy into that."

1482
01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.791
TALIESIN: That's ridiculous.

1483
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:36.370
SAM: Maybe we tell

1484
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:39.150
Jester's true story, but it sounds like

1485
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:43.130
you'll still need something fabricated

1486
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:47.930
to make you disappear or fly away or whatever.

1487
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:50.480
MATT: "We have an idea already.

1488
01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.330
"We've got a few weeks to workshop it, don't worry."

1489
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:54.856
LAURA: Yeah. We've to figure this out, man.

1490
01:05:54.856 --> 01:05:56.035
SAM: Okay.

1491
01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.610
TRAVIS: But while you're here

1492
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:01.200
and you seem to have quite the range of vision,

1493
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.500
is there anything we should ask about

1494
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.264
the Stones and your particular journey, Caduceus?

1495
01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:13.264
LAURA: (giggles) They think you're
going to answer things for them.

1496
01:06:13.353 --> 01:06:16.040
TALIESIN: Well, I wouldn't mind

1497
01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.370
a finger pointed in the right direction

1498
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:21.300
as we are about to begin our hike.

1499
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.080
But as for information, I--
MATT: "I will tell you--"

1500
01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.340
TALIESIN: Wouldn't be so foolish as to ask you.

1501
01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.054
MATT: "Tall pink furry man,

1502
01:06:29.054 --> 01:06:30.750
(chuckling)

1503
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.772
"he who bows to the winds,

1504
01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.752
"your answer lies

1505
01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:38.895
"there."

1506
01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:39.895
He points in the direction of

1507
01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.622
the jungle you were traveling already.

1508
01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:42.782
(laughter)

1509
01:06:42.782 --> 01:06:44.173
LIAM: Oh, behind me.

1510
01:06:46.899 --> 01:06:50.369
TALIESIN: For all that you have done before, I thank you.

1511
01:06:50.369 --> 01:06:52.680
MATT: "(chuckles)

1512
01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.400
"Nevertheless, sorry to intrude upon your breakfast."

1513
01:06:57.558 --> 01:07:00.462
TRAVIS: We get visited by non-gods all the time.

1514
01:07:00.462 --> 01:07:02.100
(chuckling)

1515
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.110
LIAM: Where do you go when you are not here?

1516
01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:05.518
MATT: "All over."

1517
01:07:05.518 --> 01:07:06.976
LIAM: Where are you going next?

1518
01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.594
MATT: "I think I'm going to visit an old friend."

1519
01:07:11.672 --> 01:07:14.460
LAURA: Who? Who?

1520
01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.342
MATT: "That's a story for another time.

1521
01:07:17.342 --> 01:07:21.964
"But wherever I'm going, it's definitely ashy.

1522
01:07:21.964 --> 01:07:24.420
"I'll only stay for a bit, it's bad on the skin.

1523
01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.958
"Anyway, travel safe, friends."

1524
01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:29.642
He steps back into the doorway where he

1525
01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:31.650
originally emerged as the tree begins to--

1526
01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:33.720
SAM: Who's on the Tal'Dorei Council?

1527
01:07:34.678 --> 01:07:37.087
MATT: You hear a distant scream as another falls dead.

1528
01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:38.261
(laughter)

1529
01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:39.094
LAURA: Oh no!

1530
01:07:40.016 --> 01:07:43.446
He said every time we ask, somebody on the Council dies.

1531
01:07:43.446 --> 01:07:45.700
SAM: Oh no.
LAURA: Don't do that!

1532
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.130
LIAM: Think we can go backwards so--

1533
01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:49.342
MATT: There goes Vex'ahlia's epilogue.

1534
01:07:49.342 --> 01:07:50.739
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: No.

1535
01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:52.772
SAM: Vex'ahlia is dead.

1536
01:07:52.772 --> 01:07:54.820
TALIESIN: With proper training, you can learn to do that.

1537
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.190
MATT: All the vines pull back a bit,

1538
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:59.420
but they don't entirely vanish.

1539
01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:02.880
Instead, they form this beautiful vision of the doorway

1540
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.680
with all these beautiful flowers around it,

1541
01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.400
this intricately carved-looking art piece

1542
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.070
where the door once was on the outside of this tree.

1543
01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:14.640
It seems so out of place amongst the chaotic jungle.

1544
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.450
And there in the center is a beautiful glass relief

1545
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:22.180
in the shape of a carved dick.
LAURA: Yes. (claps)

1546
01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.904
(laughter)

1547
01:08:23.904 --> 01:08:26.393
LAURA: I run up and I grab one
of the flowers and I give it to Yasha.

1548
01:08:26.393 --> 01:08:29.320
LIAM: Did it spit out my monkey before it solidified?

1549
01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.036
MATT: Yes, it did. (laughs)

1550
01:08:31.036 --> 01:08:32.836
TRAVIS: "Spit out my monkey."

1551
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.240
SAM: Jester!
TALIESIN: Well, that was nice.

1552
01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.470
SAM: Are you okay?

1553
01:08:39.502 --> 01:08:40.740
LAURA: Yes?

1554
01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.487
SAM: <i>Are</i> you okay?

1555
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.610
LAURA: It's going to take a little bit of time,

1556
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:49.283
I am not going to lie about that.

1557
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.900
I feel a little

1558
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:55.348
confused.

1559
01:08:55.348 --> 01:08:57.170
SAM: Of course. He was lying to you your whole life.

1560
01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.970
LAURA: Well, he didn't, though.

1561
01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:01.290
He never was like, "Jester, I'm a god."

1562
01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:03.320
I was like, "Oh my god, you're so powerful,

1563
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.027
"you must be a god."

1564
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.666
I said it to him.

1565
01:09:07.666 --> 01:09:10.449
SAM: He didn't correct you. That's the same as lying.

1566
01:09:10.449 --> 01:09:12.300
LAURA: Well, no.

1567
01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.960
That's not the same as lying, that's just not saying--

1568
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.410
MARISHA: Well, we call it lying by omission.

1569
01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:18.520
LIAM: At the same time, he has helped you

1570
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.790
complete many miracles, we have seen it.

1571
01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.403
LAURA: Yeah, I mean--
TALIESIN: I will admit,

1572
01:09:22.403 --> 01:09:24.510
I don't get the appeal.
LAURA: I mean,

1573
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:29.050
I've never seen anyone that wasn't in the service to a god

1574
01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:32.730
be able to do things that I've done.

1575
01:09:32.730 --> 01:09:35.780
MARISHA: Which is why I hope you have

1576
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.303
a sense of validation right now.

1577
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.420
There has been this part of me, for a long time,

1578
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.630
that I was 100% convinced, I talked about it

1579
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.900
with Fjord at one point. I think I did,

1580
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.780
or maybe I imagined it--
LIAM: You're losing the thread.

1581
01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.210
MARISHA: That

1582
01:09:55.210 --> 01:09:56.800
you created

1583
01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.280
the Traveler.

1584
01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.560
He was a figment of your imagination

1585
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.710
that you just birthed and then went off

1586
01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.980
and then it's all just you.

1587
01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.560
LAURA: Whoa, you think I could do that?

1588
01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.680
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: You kind of did.

1589
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.840
MARISHA: Because you kind of did.
TALIESIN: That's true.

1590
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.573
MARISHA: I feel kind of validated as well,

1591
01:10:14.573 --> 01:10:16.974
so I hope you feel even more validated.

1592
01:10:16.974 --> 01:10:19.155
LAURA: He was super powerful the first time I saw him.

1593
01:10:19.155 --> 01:10:20.490
I mean, like--
LIAM: I don't know how we would

1594
01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:24.870
verify that, either, that--
LAURA: Well, I mean--

1595
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:26.311
MARISHA: <i>You're</i> super powerful.

1596
01:10:26.311 --> 01:10:28.220
LAURA: He was a little kid

1597
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.700
when I first saw him and then he wasn't.

1598
01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.710
And then he was and then he wasn't.

1599
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:34.600
That was pretty powerful stuff.

1600
01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.000
TALIESIN: I've done that once.

1601
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.470
So I consider that to be very impressive.

1602
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:39.550
TRAVIS: You've done what once?

1603
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:41.509
TALIESIN: I was a little kid and then I wasn't.

1604
01:10:41.509 --> 01:10:44.225
(laughter)

1605
01:10:44.225 --> 01:10:46.690
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: Anyone can do that.

1606
01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:49.750
ASHLEY: So he, but he wasn't a real little kid

1607
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:53.029
when he met you, that's how he befriended you.

1608
01:10:53.029 --> 01:10:54.704
TRAVIS: He made himself appear that way.

1609
01:10:54.704 --> 01:10:56.487
LAURA: Yeah. Well, yeah.

1610
01:10:56.487 --> 01:10:58.695
MARISHA: He told you what <i>you</i> needed to hear.

1611
01:10:59.812 --> 01:11:01.250
LAURA: Don't most gods?

1612
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:04.223
SAM: It sounds like you also told him
what he needed to hear.

1613
01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:05.056
TRAVIS: No.

1614
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:06.833
LAURA: Well.

1615
01:11:06.833 --> 01:11:09.860
SAM: I mean, he clearly needs you, too.

1616
01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.565
He's asking for your help at Traveler Con--

1617
01:11:11.565 --> 01:11:12.398
LAURA: Sure.

1618
01:11:12.398 --> 01:11:16.590
SAM: But more than that, over the past-- how old are you?

1619
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:18.338
14, 15?

1620
01:11:18.338 --> 01:11:20.183
I have no concept of--
LAURA: 14 or 15?

1621
01:11:20.183 --> 01:11:22.660
SAM: Well, I mean, that's how you act, I don't know.

1622
01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.001
LAURA: Oh, do I really?

1623
01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:26.126
SAM: No, you're just so cute.

1624
01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:31.270
But for all that time, he's been

1625
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:32.590
coming back to you for a reason.

1626
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:35.240
He needs you, he needs your validation,

1627
01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.450
he needs your support--
LAURA: It's not that he

1628
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:38.780
just needs my validation and he needs my support.

1629
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.300
He likes me, we're friends.

1630
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.690
SAM: I know, but that's pretty impressive.

1631
01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:44.620
TRAVIS: Jester can I you an important question?

1632
01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:47.590
He's never asked you to harm anyone, right?

1633
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:49.140
All these tricks, they're not at

1634
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:51.850
the physical expense of anyone, everyone's going to be

1635
01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:53.780
safe and have a laugh afterwards, right?

1636
01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.427
It's not ever going to end in

1637
01:11:56.427 --> 01:11:58.000
someone being hurt?
LAURA: Well, I mean,

1638
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.180
he definitely gives me the ability to hurt people.

1639
01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:02.460
I mean, you guys have seen that.

1640
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.940
LIAM: Yeah, but only in defense of yourself and us,

1641
01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:08.630
not for giggles and shits.
MARISHA: Fjord's got a point.

1642
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:12.170
LAURA: I mean, that's not what he's after, you know?

1643
01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:14.070
You heard him say,

1644
01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.420
it's boring to him.

1645
01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:19.000
Just going out and killing someone, what's the point, right?

1646
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.760
LIAM: He's looking for fun, he's not looking
to strangle anyone or something like that.

1647
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.776
LAURA: Exactly.

1648
01:12:22.776 --> 01:12:25.893
MATT: Been there, done that.

1649
01:12:25.893 --> 01:12:29.315
TALIESIN: I can't tell if you walked up
to that or not, I really can't.

1650
01:12:29.315 --> 01:12:31.288
TRAVIS: I mean, a cult is all well and good.

1651
01:12:31.288 --> 01:12:34.190
I admit, I don't know a ton about them, but I do feel like,

1652
01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:38.340
you know, the story on cults is that, I don't know,

1653
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.650
people normally die or worse.
LAURA: I mean, the only, the only,

1654
01:12:43.147 --> 01:12:45.810
(sighs) the only experience I have with cults outside of,

1655
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:49.720
apparently, my own is, is--
MARISHA: The Angel of Irons.

1656
01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.890
LAURA: Yeah, and they were real bad.

1657
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:53.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're not great.

1658
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:57.620
LAURA: But I don't think that means that we have to be.

1659
01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:00.350
Are we a cult?

1660
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.241
Oh man.

1661
01:13:02.241 --> 01:13:06.240
TRAVIS: He literally said you were a cult.
LAURA: I know what he said, Fjord!

1662
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.760
MARISHA: But I think this,

1663
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.760
I think Traveler Con

1664
01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.680
could be the deciding factor, it could be the turning point.

1665
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.663
TRAVIS: Of what?

1666
01:13:17.663 --> 01:13:20.988
MARISHA: Of making it a cult versus a religion.

1667
01:13:20.988 --> 01:13:22.050
TRAVIS: No, it's a cult.

1668
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:24.729
MARISHA: It's a cult.
TALIESIN: It's--

1669
01:13:24.729 --> 01:13:27.000
SAM: But we could make it a positive cult.

1670
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.683
We could make it--
LIAM: Yes, this is the thing--

1671
01:13:29.683 --> 01:13:32.050
SAM: We could look at this as a,

1672
01:13:32.050 --> 01:13:34.833
not a problem, but a,

1673
01:13:36.074 --> 01:13:40.840
a cult-otunity, like an opportunity, to make a--

1674
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.420
LAURA: Cult-ortunity.
TALIESIN: Cult-ortunity?

1675
01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:45.890
SAM: To be good, to make these people have good lives

1676
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:50.610
and, or at least, I don't know, it's a cult.

1677
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:53.270
LIAM: I agree, well, the semantics, cult, religion,

1678
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:56.430
what is very obvious is that he trusts in you, as do we,

1679
01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.070
and if he is looking to you for guidance,

1680
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:03.030
if you are his number one, perhaps you have

1681
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:06.540
the ability to decide what this is

1682
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.373
in the world.
LAURA: I mean, yeah,

1683
01:14:07.373 --> 01:14:09.210
that's the thing, I think I do.

1684
01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:10.430
MARISHA: You do.
LAURA: I mean,

1685
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:13.370
we got to figure this out, I mean, like (sighs)--

1686
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:16.550
TRAVIS: Jester, how do you feel about all this?

1687
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:18.130
You thought he was a god before.

1688
01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:21.640
He's not, it doesn't sound like he's even close.

1689
01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:23.750
How do you feel about being able to

1690
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.950
decide what he will become?

1691
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.013
LAURA: Well,

1692
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.890
I don't think he wants to be a god-god.

1693
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:37.684
I think,

1694
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:45.060
I don't know, I feel like it's a lot of pressure.

1695
01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.150
I feel a little overwhelmed, I'm not going to lie.

1696
01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.980
ASHLEY: But what does he really want, then?

1697
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.939
If he doesn't want to be a god?

1698
01:14:53.939 --> 01:14:55.872
LAURA: I think he wants the power,

1699
01:14:55.872 --> 01:14:59.046
he enjoys the people, you know, worshiping him.

1700
01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.745
He likes the compliments.

1701
01:15:02.745 --> 01:15:04.860
TALIESIN: I did get a sense of ego.

1702
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.010
LAURA: I mean, it's understandable.

1703
01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:08.260
He's really powerful, he's super cool,

1704
01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:11.100
and he's very handsome now that I've actually seen his face,

1705
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.300
it is as handsome as I

1706
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.357
thought it was going to be--
TRAVIS: The hair's a bit much, but sure.

1707
01:15:14.357 --> 01:15:16.910
LAURA: I've never seen eyebrows quite that large.

1708
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.670
I wonder how he gets them like that.

1709
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:21.150
MARISHA: He should obviously tweeze a little.

1710
01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.910
LAURA: No! No, no.
MARISHA: I mean, I'm just saying.

1711
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:25.060
TALIESIN: Tweeze?
LIAM: End of the day,

1712
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.090
it is an awful lot to process for you and for us.

1713
01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.270
Perhaps maybe we, I mean, I feel like

1714
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:32.580
we're all picking at you quite a bit.

1715
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.710
Maybe you need just some time to mull it over.

1716
01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:37.980
SAM: I'm going to be doing some meditation soon.

1717
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:40.950
Maybe you could join me.
LAURA: We can both meditate.

1718
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:42.370
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: I'll lead you

1719
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:43.840
in another guided meditation.

1720
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.680
Everyone fell asleep in the last one.

1721
01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.853
LAURA: I didn't fall asleep.
TALEISIN: Wow, I fell asleep.

1722
01:15:47.853 --> 01:15:48.686
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1723
01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.360
Okay.

1724
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.170
Regardless, we're here for you and we trust you.

1725
01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:56.750
SAM: Yeah, if you want to put on a great show

1726
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:59.060
for these people, we'll help you do it.

1727
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:04.760
LAURA: Because it would be helping them, right?

1728
01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.000
I mean, how much of a bummer would it be

1729
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.590
if they all got out to Traveler Con

1730
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:10.940
and then it was like, "Just kidding"?

1731
01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.705
MARISHA: Cheese sandwiches--

1732
01:16:12.705 --> 01:16:15.970
LAURA: With, like, a mattress on the ground or something.

1733
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:17.490
MARISHA: That would be fucked up.
LAURA: That would suck.

1734
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.520
LIAM: But you are more creative than that.

1735
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.900
You just need some time to let this sink in.

1736
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:23.733
LAURA: Yeah.

1737
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.863
MARISHA: Hey.

1738
01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:30.685
Just give Jester a hug.
LAURA: Oh, Beau.

1739
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:33.140
Thanks, Beau.

1740
01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.077
SAM: I'll join the hug.

1741
01:16:34.077 --> 01:16:36.279
LAURA: Oh, thanks Nott.
SAM: Chaos hug.

1742
01:16:36.279 --> 01:16:38.035
LAURA: Chaos hug.
MARISHA: Yasha.

1743
01:16:40.547 --> 01:16:42.797
(laughter)

1744
01:16:43.871 --> 01:16:45.233
TRAVIS: All right, well.

1745
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:48.170
We were here for a reason.

1746
01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.090
Should we?
SAM: Oh, yeah.

1747
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:51.850
TRAVIS: Should we continue on?
LAURA: Sorry, Caduceus.

1748
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:52.860
I didn't mean to--
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

1749
01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:54.250
This is--
LAURA: -- hijack.

1750
01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:55.325
TALIESIN: There's no hijacking,

1751
01:16:55.325 --> 01:16:59.553
this is all part of the journey.

1752
01:16:59.553 --> 01:17:00.886
This is good.

1753
01:17:00.886 --> 01:17:01.719
LAURA: This

1754
01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.040
doorway is really beautiful, though, isn't it?

1755
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.090
TALIESIN: It's very impressive.

1756
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.560
ASHLEY: It is very beautiful
TRAVIS: It's a big dick.

1757
01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.450
LAURA: It's a little dick in glass.

1758
01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:15.782
ASHLEY: Does that look like a big dick to you?

1759
01:17:15.782 --> 01:17:17.280
(laughter)

1760
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.470
MARISHA: Wait, what do you see?

1761
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:21.453
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.
TRAVIS: Comparably, yes.

1762
01:17:21.453 --> 01:17:23.066
(laughter)

1763
01:17:23.066 --> 01:17:24.476
Huge dick.

1764
01:17:24.476 --> 01:17:26.030
(laughter)

1765
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:27.560
Someone can walk through that dick.

1766
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.470
Yes, it's--
LAURA: Well,

1767
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:30.760
it's just a little dick on the door.

1768
01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.360
The whole door isn't shaped like a dick.

1769
01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.598
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought it was the whole door.

1770
01:17:34.598 --> 01:17:35.431
TALEISIN: I thought it grew, I thought it was a--

1771
01:17:35.431 --> 01:17:38.252
LAURA: No, it's a door and there's a little glass relief--

1772
01:17:38.252 --> 01:17:41.233
TRAVIS: It's a big glass schlong.

1773
01:17:41.233 --> 01:17:42.690
(laughter)

1774
01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:46.085
LAURA: I've just going to leave one of my Traveler shrines.

1775
01:17:46.085 --> 01:17:47.210
MATT: Okay.

1776
01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:48.500
You go ahead and set that at the base

1777
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.108
of the beautiful wooden door frame.

1778
01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.213
You gather your things.

1779
01:17:53.213 --> 01:17:54.600
Are you guys heading deeper into the jungle

1780
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.490
in the direction that you were previously traveling?

1781
01:17:57.490 --> 01:17:58.620
TALIESIN: Just imagine the grove from

1782
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.853
Nightmare Before Christmas going down.

1783
01:18:00.853 --> 01:18:01.686
"What?"

1784
01:18:01.686 --> 01:18:03.419
(laughter)

1785
01:18:03.419 --> 01:18:04.302
MATT: "Where did?"--

1786
01:18:04.302 --> 01:18:06.401
TRAVIS: Pumpkins, clover,

1787
01:18:06.401 --> 01:18:07.812
mushroom tip.

1788
01:18:07.812 --> 01:18:09.692
(laughter)

1789
01:18:09.692 --> 01:18:11.482
TALIESIN: ♪ What's this? ♪
MATT, TRAVIS, LIAM, and TALIESIN: ♪ What's this? ♪

1790
01:18:11.482 --> 01:18:14.990
(laughter)

1791
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.554
LIAM: ♪ There's penis everywhere. ♪

1792
01:18:16.554 --> 01:18:18.804
(laughter)

1793
01:18:20.403 --> 01:18:21.664
MATT: (imitated slapping)

1794
01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:24.760
LIAM: I'm going right in, bing, oh.

1795
01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.593
MATT: Oh.

1796
01:18:25.593 --> 01:18:27.020
Anyway.

1797
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.530
First off, who is, what's the marching order here

1798
01:18:29.530 --> 01:18:30.780
as you continue into the jungle?

1799
01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.850
TALIESIN: I'll take the front.
LIAM: In green robes, still.

1800
01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:35.890
You've got seven and a half more hours of it.

1801
01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:37.090
LAURA: Sweet.

1802
01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:39.170
LIAM: Camouflage.
MATT: Fjord behind Caduceus.

1803
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:41.110
TALIESIN: I might get some customization if you're

1804
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:42.900
going on that.
MATT: And behind Fjord?

1805
01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:47.270
TALIESIN: I would like a big mossy green like

1806
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:50.467
whatever would be the swamp Keyleth special.

1807
01:18:50.467 --> 01:18:52.575
LIAM: Okay so the shoulders topped with grizzle.

1808
01:18:52.575 --> 01:18:53.780
MATT: There's enough space

1809
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.650
through a lot of this jungle to travel in pairs of two,

1810
01:18:56.650 --> 01:19:00.090
so it doesn't have to be single file right now, so.

1811
01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.210
Does that mean you want to put Fjord up front with Caduceus?

1812
01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:04.241
TALIESIN: Sure.

1813
01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:05.660
MATT: And then Beauregard's in the back.

1814
01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:08.180
Who's with Beau?
LIAM: I will go with Beau.

1815
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.950
MATT: All right and then it would probably be--

1816
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:12.030
MARISHA: Empire kids.
LAURA: Where's Nott?

1817
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:14.180
MATT: Nott, where do you want to be?
SAM: I'll be next to Yasha.

1818
01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.553
LAURA: Okay, I'll go in the back.
SAM: Just looking at my flask.

1819
01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:18.736
MATT: (laughs) Fair enough.

1820
01:19:18.736 --> 01:19:20.390
Okay.
LIAM: Right at eye level.

1821
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:22.140
SAM: Yeah, jangling in front of me.

1822
01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:24.490
MATT: Continuing on,

1823
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.800
the gentle, occasionally fading in and out, scents of

1824
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:35.130
distant sea ocean air

1825
01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:39.860
meets with the earthy smell of ferns and plants and the

1826
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.120
general jungle scents that fill the space,

1827
01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.260
occasionally catching scents of rotting citrus

1828
01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:48.260
as well as other elements of decay

1829
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.990
that normally come across carcasses

1830
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:52.520
and other creatures that have been hunted

1831
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.627
or died, seemingly naturally, within the jungle.

1832
01:19:56.627 --> 01:20:00.050
(birds calling)

1833
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:01.650
Caduceus, make a perception check.

1834
01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:04.908
Actually, you and Fjord both make perception checks, please.

1835
01:20:07.305 --> 01:20:10.036
TALIESIN: Natural 20.
TRAVIS: Seven.

1836
01:20:10.036 --> 01:20:12.225
TALIESIN: 29.
MATT: All righty.

1837
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:16.030
TALIESIN: I'm just letting Decompose
go everywhere, by the way.

1838
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:18.614
I'm just leaving a trail.
MATT: Okay.

1839
01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:20.764
TALIESIN: I'm in a mood.
MATT: Interesting note, okay.

1840
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.347
LIAM: Insult my god, will ya?
TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm fine.

1841
01:20:26.262 --> 01:20:28.790
MATT: (chuckles) Continuing forward, you catch,

1842
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:33.450
pretty early into the first hour or so of your travel,

1843
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.990
small patches of dark blue and purple fungus

1844
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:38.600
that's set in some of the trees

1845
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:42.158
where an oddly-colored mushroom grows out of

1846
01:20:42.158 --> 01:20:45.620
a strange material that appears strung to or attached to

1847
01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.640
elements of tree trunks and nearby rocks,

1848
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:51.250
just little patches of strange fungus.

1849
01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:56.236
TALIESIN: You seem odd. Are you odd?

1850
01:20:56.236 --> 01:20:57.616
LAURA: Hmm?

1851
01:20:57.616 --> 01:21:00.910
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm talking to this guy over here.

1852
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:03.000
LIAM: Fjord?
TRAVIS: Yes?

1853
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.486
LIAM: Oh.
SAM: (wheezing laughter)

1854
01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:06.319
TALIESIN: Huh.

1855
01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:09.310
MATT: Make a nature check, if you'd like.

1856
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:12.021
TALIESIN: That's not useful, but here we go.

1857
01:21:12.021 --> 01:21:15.222
If I'm going to nature check, I'm going to give myself a d4.

1858
01:21:15.222 --> 01:21:17.208
I suck at nature checks.

1859
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.070
Ooh, that's better.

1860
01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:25.240
I rolled a 14, so 13.
MATT: 13.

1861
01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.080
No idea what this fungus is, unfortunately.

1862
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.170
It's different and you're uncertain if

1863
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:34.180
it's naturalness-based because its coloration

1864
01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:36.180
and its placement is very splotchy

1865
01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:40.140
and definitely contrasts with the general themes

1866
01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:42.007
and coloration of the jungle around you.

1867
01:21:42.007 --> 01:21:43.970
TALIESIN: Going to tap it with
the tip of my-- I'm going to back up a bit

1868
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:47.210
and just tap a bit with the tip of my crystal staff.

1869
01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:49.970
MATT: Okay. (tapping)

1870
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:52.490
It shifts slightly, doesn't seem to react from the impact.

1871
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:54.980
LIAM: Does it resemble any kind of component or ingredient

1872
01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:56.930
that I ever worked with at the Academy?

1873
01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:00.486
MATT: Make an arcana check.

1874
01:22:00.486 --> 01:22:01.677
LIAM: Oh jeez.

1875
01:22:01.677 --> 01:22:03.820
<i>Trenta,</i> 14, 24.
MATT: 24.

1876
01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.720
No, actually.

1877
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.290
But not only that you don't recognize it,

1878
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:10.990
you're fairly certain in all of your research,

1879
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:12.290
this is something that has not--

1880
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:15.790
you've not come across in your time at school,

1881
01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:18.500
which lets you know that this isn't

1882
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.710
something that you've used previously

1883
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:21.480
or learned about as a material component.

1884
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.846
LIAM: I pull out a small knife and just give it a little--

1885
01:22:24.846 --> 01:22:25.679
LAURA: (screeching)

1886
01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:27.759
LIAM: Anything happen?

1887
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:30.920
MATT: Kind of cuts off a little bit.

1888
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.580
What you do catch as you're cutting through

1889
01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.900
is the fungus is pretty thick,

1890
01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.290
but as you cut it away, behind it is

1891
01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:42.060
a waxy-like substance, a beeswax-type material

1892
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:44.210
that is coated over the section of the tree

1893
01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:45.860
where the fungus is growing from.

1894
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.570
LIAM: I will take that fungus and I will wrap it in some cloth

1895
01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:50.820
and put it away.
MATT: Okay.

1896
01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:55.300
LIAM: I will pull up some flame in my hand

1897
01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:59.020
with a cantrip and just hold it close to

1898
01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.402
the wax.
MATT: Okay.

1899
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:03.580
It slowly begins to melt.

1900
01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.740
You watch it just drip down in these little beads.

1901
01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.020
As it begins to rapidly burn away,

1902
01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.760
due to your pressure and the heat,

1903
01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.170
it begins to give way to bones.

1904
01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.870
SAM: Ooh.
TALIESIN: We're on the right track.

1905
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:23.437
TRAVIS: We're on the right track?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1906
01:23:23.437 --> 01:23:25.507
TRAVIS: Because the trees are made of bones?

1907
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:29.930
I feel like you're not sharing enough information.

1908
01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.145
LIAM: Do you mean the tree has bones

1909
01:23:34.145 --> 01:23:36.450
or there are little bones shoved in there?

1910
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:38.030
MATT: No, the tree isn't bones

1911
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:40.320
but the wax substance that is there

1912
01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.740
that the fungus is growing out of,

1913
01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:45.340
it looks like it's trapping in something that had bones.

1914
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:47.412
LIAM: Oh.
LAURA: Little bones or big bones?

1915
01:23:47.412 --> 01:23:49.020
LIAM: Yeah, little tiny ones?
MATT: From the one,

1916
01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.303
from what you're looking at right now, small bones.

1917
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:53.370
Make a nature check.

1918
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.440
ASHLEY: Wait, so the fungus is growing--

1919
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.500
MATT: Sorry, medicine, medicine check for you.

1920
01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.331
LIAM: Medicine?
MATT: Yes.

1921
01:23:59.331 --> 01:24:00.455
LIAM: 18.

1922
01:24:00.455 --> 01:24:02.603
MATT: 18, okay.
SAM: Dem bones.

1923
01:24:02.603 --> 01:24:05.910
MATT: There is damage to the bones, they are scarred,

1924
01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.960
pockmarked across the surface,

1925
01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.620
and you gather the damage to be acidic in nature.

1926
01:24:14.232 --> 01:24:17.290
SAM: Acidic damage killed a thing and then they--

1927
01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:19.090
LAURA: Something's going to do acid damage around here,

1928
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:20.800
something's going to do acid damage around here.

1929
01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.550
MARISHA: Anyone got stuff?
LAURA: I start looking around

1930
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:24.596
at plants that look like they could shoot out acid.

1931
01:24:24.596 --> 01:24:26.458
LIAM: So some sort of living thing

1932
01:24:26.458 --> 01:24:29.110
is either collecting creatures and sealing them in

1933
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:32.170
after they have disposed of them or--

1934
01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.170
SAM: Like a spider or--
TALIESIN: We're going to be

1935
01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:37.430
coming into contact with some very unusual creatures.

1936
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:39.160
MARISHA: Like man-eating plants?

1937
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.760
TALIESIN: Things that you've never seen before.

1938
01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.520
TRAVIS: Things that <i>you've</i> never seen before.

1939
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.170
TALIESIN: Things that nobody's ever seen before.

1940
01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:46.200
TRAVIS: Fair enough, that's worse.

1941
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.150
SAM: ROUSs?
TALIESIN: Any stories in your family?

1942
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:51.443
TALIESIN: Just the one.
LIAM: Hm.

1943
01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:53.854
TALIESIN: (sighs)

1944
01:24:53.854 --> 01:24:56.400
"From my altar, you will feed these limbs to the beasts

1945
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.940
"that wander there so that they may hold my mark.

1946
01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.600
"Upon this site, you shall build a menagerie

1947
01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.868
"whose beasts shall be my gift to the Changebringer

1948
01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:08.083
"to remind her that nature is infinite."

1949
01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:12.170
We're going to see some interesting things,

1950
01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.880
many of them possibly dangerous.

1951
01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.330
LAURA: Do we need to write stuff like that

1952
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:17.530
down for the Traveler, too?

1953
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.960
I mean, some really cool--
MARISHA: It's honestly a good idea.

1954
01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.840
It's really good propaganda.
SAM: That's good material.

1955
01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.690
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not bad.
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was great.

1956
01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:27.015
LAURA: Will you help me? Did you write that stuff?

1957
01:25:27.015 --> 01:25:28.700
TALIESIN: Of course not. These are
the same stories that have

1958
01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:30.420
been told in my family for generations.

1959
01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.983
LAURA: See? We really need.

1960
01:25:32.983 --> 01:25:34.202
MARISHA: The more highfalutin you are--

1961
01:25:34.202 --> 01:25:36.400
LAURA: Should we just say that
we've had those for generations

1962
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.950
and share them with the rest of the people?

1963
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:40.780
SAM: But we need to get them first.
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

1964
01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:42.230
God, why do we keep doing--

1965
01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:44.690
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out
for whatever it is we attracted--

1966
01:25:44.690 --> 01:25:47.755
MATT: Okay, no worries.
LIAM: As the group gets louder.

1967
01:25:47.755 --> 01:25:49.640
(laughter)

1968
01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:52.273
MATT: Continuing on from this point,

1969
01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:54.120
you don't see them often.

1970
01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.982
Like every five or so minutes,

1971
01:25:55.982 --> 01:25:58.610
you'll see a few patches in an area.

1972
01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:00.752
You do come, they look to be relatively small

1973
01:26:00.752 --> 01:26:02.910
and even the bones that you pulled from that,

1974
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:04.940
they look to be probably of a larger rodent,

1975
01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:08.670
a vole or some sort of a burrowing-type rodent creature.

1976
01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:14.100
You do, about another hour or so into travel,

1977
01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.190
once again, you're beginning to sweat beneath your armor,

1978
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:19.819
it's uncomfortable, but you're still keeping vigilant,

1979
01:26:19.819 --> 01:26:22.320
just even in your passive perception, you pick out,

1980
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.250
now that you know what to look for, one larger patch.

1981
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:28.330
It looks like a four foot by three foot patch

1982
01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:29.640
that is actually bulbous

1983
01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.300
on the side of a tree that sits where some rocks

1984
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.770
are pressed into its base roots off to the side.

1985
01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:36.570
The fungus is larger.

1986
01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:38.480
It's the same type of fungus, but it's growing,

1987
01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:41.040
and whereas previously it was small, little stalks,

1988
01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.050
some of them are three inches in diameter

1989
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:48.700
and the actual ends, the caps, are about that big.

1990
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:51.860
TALIESIN: I'm keeping a Resistance buff up as I walk.

1991
01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.061
ASHLEY: I recognize these things.

1992
01:26:55.061 --> 01:26:56.783
I'm just kidding.
SAM: Wait, what?

1993
01:26:56.783 --> 01:26:58.494
(laughter)

1994
01:26:58.494 --> 01:26:59.544
TALIESIN: Did we meet at Coachella?

1995
01:26:59.544 --> 01:27:00.960
No--
MATT: Actually, make a nature check.

1996
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.793
ASHLEY: Okay.

1997
01:27:04.444 --> 01:27:06.160
MARISHA: Do I know you from Instagram?

1998
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:08.860
TALIESIN: Great feed.
ASHLEY: 10.

1999
01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:09.880
MATT: 10.

2000
01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.713
Sadly, you do not recognize these.

2001
01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:18.020
TRAVIS: Press on?
SAM: Off we go, I guess.

2002
01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.853
TALIESIN: Press on quietly, keep an eye out.

2003
01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:26.470
MATT: Caduceus, Fjord, both make

2004
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.387
perception checks once more for me.

2005
01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.070
TRAVIS: Fuck you.
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck you.

2006
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:35.580
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Six.

2007
01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.980
TALIESIN: 16.

2008
01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:39.420
MATT: 16?
TALIESIN: For me, that's terrible.

2009
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:43.990
MATT: Okay, what you do see, as you continue onward

2010
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.243
about two more hours, one, there are

2011
01:27:50.243 --> 01:27:52.797
a number of living creatures in this jungle

2012
01:27:52.797 --> 01:27:54.640
that you see the shifting through the boughs

2013
01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.190
that you see fleeing as you approach,

2014
01:27:57.190 --> 01:28:00.390
this heavy footfalls as you crunch through

2015
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:02.730
the undergrowth sending them scattering a bit.

2016
01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:04.188
You're not being quiet.

2017
01:28:05.516 --> 01:28:07.559
You're not clomping through to make noise,

2018
01:28:07.559 --> 01:28:10.220
but you're not carefully, steadily going through,

2019
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.770
unless you want to begin to do so.

2020
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:14.110
But you can see the woodland creatures

2021
01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:16.310
and the various denizens scatter as they go.

2022
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:22.150
You begin to notice, beyond just these occasional patches,

2023
01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:24.290
you begin to see

2024
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:30.250
strange piles of freshly turned earth,

2025
01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:34.020
bright red, vibrant earth, impressive in size.

2026
01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.780
Maybe four or five feet from end to end and about

2027
01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.700
two and a half feet tall.
MARISHA: Like an ant hill?

2028
01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.450
MATT: Like an ant hill type of a thing.

2029
01:28:46.150 --> 01:28:48.240
You just come upon one, just over cresting an area,

2030
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.510
you see it about 30, 35 feet ahead of you.

2031
01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:53.630
TALIESIN: Going to keep an eye on the ground.

2032
01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:56.800
Is it shifting?

2033
01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.080
MATT: It is not shifting.

2034
01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.740
TRAVIS: What about the canopy of branches above us?

2035
01:29:04.279 --> 01:29:05.900
MATT: You look up there, you see another patch of

2036
01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:07.680
that waxy element that's stopped

2037
01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.640
and there you can see part of it is melted away over time

2038
01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.090
and you can see elements of a long,

2039
01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.610
baboon-like skeletal arm that is

2040
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:17.310
mostly dissolved and decayed that's hanging out of it.

2041
01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.550
But the same the fungus growing beyond it

2042
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:23.540
and it's slowly eroding.
TRAVIS: Just in case,

2043
01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:25.690
I'll activate Divine Sense.

2044
01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:28.020
Within 60 feet, any celestial, fiend,

2045
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.000
or undead presence.
MATT: Okay.

2046
01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:33.748
You don't sense anything.

2047
01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.591
LIAM: I ask, in my mind,

2048
01:29:39.591 --> 01:29:42.132
Frumpkin to go scurrying up a tree

2049
01:29:42.132 --> 01:29:45.930
and plant a hand on her shoulder

2050
01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:50.090
and bamf into Frumpkin and we'll go along for the ride

2051
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:53.530
to try to get close to this hill, this pile of dirt.

2052
01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:56.490
If there is any vines or anything hanging down close to it,

2053
01:29:56.490 --> 01:29:58.700
I will let him scurry down that.

2054
01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.060
If not, I'll let him chance his way on the ground

2055
01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.850
to get a closer look.
MATT: Okay.

2056
01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:05.560
There's no vines directly above it.

2057
01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.200
Well, there are a handful that are fallen

2058
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.720
but none that would lead directly to it.

2059
01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.770
Frumpkin would have to leap down

2060
01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:13.353
or probably step up towards it.

2061
01:30:15.052 --> 01:30:16.937
LIAM: Okay, well, that's what we will do.

2062
01:30:16.937 --> 01:30:20.830
Frumpkin, at a tree closest to it, goes down to it

2063
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:23.620
and begins to slowly creep up

2064
01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.870
and I tell him to look over and inside.

2065
01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.857
MATT: Perception check on Frumpkin.

2066
01:30:36.367 --> 01:30:37.672
MARISHA: Hm.
LIAM: Never good.

2067
01:30:38.947 --> 01:30:40.565
It is 12.
MATT: Okay.

2068
01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.230
Looking at the pile, it does not appear to be moving,

2069
01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:46.230
there does not appear to be any sort of,

2070
01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:52.130
you know, cavernous anthill-like entrances or tunnels.

2071
01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.400
It looks very clean.
LIAM: I tell him to pick up

2072
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.430
just a random stone, if he can find one,

2073
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:02.110
and toss it in.
MATT: (monkey ooh) (blows) Throws it.

2074
01:31:03.226 --> 01:31:07.830
(stone bouncing) No reaction.

2075
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:09.820
LIAM: I tell him to run into it and go around

2076
01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.300
in a little circle and then scurry out.

2077
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.330
MATT: Mmkay. (speedy running)

2078
01:31:13.330 --> 01:31:15.530
Runs back, nothing.

2079
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:17.160
LIAM: I summon him back.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

2080
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.160
LIAM: I just had a look.

2081
01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.620
I thought that it maybe would swallow him up, but

2082
01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:23.628
nothing like that happened.

2083
01:31:23.628 --> 01:31:25.690
SAM: Good, right?

2084
01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:28.320
TALIESIN: I don't think that's their purpose.

2085
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.120
LAURA: What do you think that purpose is?

2086
01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:35.590
TALIESIN: I think their purpose is to (sighs)

2087
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:40.568
either eat or digest what's already dead.

2088
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.090
TRAVIS: Those mounds in front of us, they're earth, right?

2089
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:45.980
They're not like huge piles of shit?

2090
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:49.740
MATT: It looks like freshly tilled earth,

2091
01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:53.130
though it's like bits of bright red soil,

2092
01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:56.500
which is very much contrasting against the jungle floor.

2093
01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.820
But the jungle floor is mostly

2094
01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.210
under brush and decaying vegetation.

2095
01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:03.160
You haven't probably seen

2096
01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:08.220
raw, exposed dirt and if you had, it may have had

2097
01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:10.190
a reddish tint, but it's been a dirty red.

2098
01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:13.440
This is very fresh, bright, vibrant, clean red.

2099
01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.540
MARISHA: Can I just crouch down and just

2100
01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.900
dig a little pit next to me and see if

2101
01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:19.510
it's red underneath?
MATT: Sure.

2102
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:21.593
Make a nature check.
MARISHA: Eh.

2103
01:32:25.137 --> 01:32:28.513
(chuckles) Natural one.
MATT: Okay.

2104
01:32:28.513 --> 01:32:30.780
TALIESIN: Forget how to dig.

2105
01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.452
MARISHA: (groaning)

2106
01:32:32.452 --> 01:32:34.190
(laughter)
LAURA: Shove your face in it.

2107
01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:37.970
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)
SAM: Why are you eating dirt?

2108
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:40.995
MATT: You scoop through and it's loose,

2109
01:32:40.995 --> 01:32:42.770
it isn't packed tightly,

2110
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:44.640
and it just crumbles in your hands.

2111
01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.360
It's fresh earth.
MARISHA: Whoa.

2112
01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.140
LAURA: How big are the piles?
MATT: It was about

2113
01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.210
five feet from end to end, about two and a half feet tall

2114
01:32:54.210 --> 01:32:58.300
total, so it's pretty--
LAURA: Can I, can I?

2115
01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.900
Use your staff, I don't want to stick my finger in it.

2116
01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.910
Put your staff in the middle and see if it--

2117
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:03.830
TALIESIN: Why would I do that?

2118
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:05.240
LAURA: What if there's something in there?

2119
01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.360
TALIESIN: No, I don't want to poke it.

2120
01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.760
I would just leave it alone.

2121
01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.410
LAURA: Yasha, use your sword.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

2122
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.850
TRAVIS: I have one responsibility on this team.

2123
01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:17.740
I'll summon my sword and I'll poke the hill.

2124
01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:21.190
MATT: Okay. (poking)

2125
01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:23.530
TRAVIS: No fucking fire ants come pouring out of that shit?

2126
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:25.180
MATT: Nope, not at all.
SAM: Baby spiders.

2127
01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:28.770
ASHLEY: Can I pick some of it up and kind of

2128
01:33:29.690 --> 01:33:30.704
mush-el it?
MATT: Yeah.

2129
01:33:30.704 --> 01:33:33.020
ASHLEY: What if it's like a, add some water

2130
01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.350
and it's clay or something?

2131
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:36.380
Don't you have something to do with clay?

2132
01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.710
TALIESIN: Not here.
LAURA: Oh yeah.

2133
01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:41.850
MATT: It crumbles, it's very clean earth.

2134
01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:43.950
SAM: Don't you pour my booze onto that.

2135
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:45.860
TRAVIS: It's like four or five feet high, like a--

2136
01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.980
MATT: Just about two and a half feet high.

2137
01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:50.780
LAURA: Have we looked up to see what,

2138
01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.240
has it dropped from anywhere?

2139
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.140
No?
TRAVIS: There's a

2140
01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:58.305
baboon-like carcass covered in wax up there--

2141
01:33:58.305 --> 01:33:59.590
ASHLEY: How many of them are there again?

2142
01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:01.460
MATT: You only see one right now.

2143
01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.422
MARISHA: Just one?
MATT: Yeah.

2144
01:34:03.422 --> 01:34:04.948
SAM: I wonder if it's old poop from

2145
01:34:04.948 --> 01:34:06.678
a big elephant or something--

2146
01:34:06.678 --> 01:34:07.511
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.

2147
01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:09.850
TRAVIS: Let's keep going.
LAURA: I'm going to dig around the,

2148
01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:12.320
I'm going to go look at the dirt not in the pile,

2149
01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.200
I'm going to get rid of some of the leaves and foliage

2150
01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.850
on the ground and see what color the ground is.

2151
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:18.610
MATT: Okay, you dig through.

2152
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:22.800
The earth beneath is a similar reddish color,

2153
01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:26.230
but it's all very suffused with

2154
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:31.000
dead vegetation and grayish decaying matter and

2155
01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:35.530
roots that are thick and thin,

2156
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:38.840
a network of plant capillaries that

2157
01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.200
are just heavily sifted through.

2158
01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.310
It looks like the same earth, but

2159
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:45.103
the earth you see in this pile is clean.

2160
01:34:45.103 --> 01:34:48.240
LAURA: What?
SAM: Clean dirt?

2161
01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.075
That's crazy.
LAURA: Why would there be

2162
01:34:49.075 --> 01:34:51.147
clean dirt here?
MARISHA: It's got to be be ants

2163
01:34:51.147 --> 01:34:53.350
or something, right?
SAM: Yeah.

2164
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:56.269
LAURA: Oh, giant ants.
TRAVIS: I'll also cast

2165
01:34:56.269 --> 01:34:59.180
See Invisibility with the sword out.

2166
01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.160
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Just for the next hour.

2167
01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.280
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: Just in case

2168
01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.770
because jungles are creepy as fuck.

2169
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:07.039
MATT: Mmkay.
MARISHA: Let's just go around it.

2170
01:35:07.039 --> 01:35:08.350
SAM: Yeah, of course.

2171
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:09.520
MARISHA: And I'll be on the lookout

2172
01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.870
for others.
MATT: Okay.

2173
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:13.720
All right, so you guys continue to move forward--

2174
01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.090
LAURA: I swish my tail and try to bat

2175
01:35:16.090 --> 01:35:18.339
some of it away as we walk past it.

2176
01:35:18.339 --> 01:35:22.710
MATT: (tail swish) Scatters easily, as--

2177
01:35:22.710 --> 01:35:26.140
LAURA: That's weird.
MATT: Loose dirt is wont to do.

2178
01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.273
Continuing on,

2179
01:35:30.564 --> 01:35:33.740
about another 15 or 20 or so minutes,

2180
01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:38.680
you immediately see another mound,

2181
01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:41.710
similar coloration, of clean dirt situated

2182
01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.630
and about 30 feet beyond that,

2183
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:52.200
you see a very large mass of this same waxy substance.

2184
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:57.645
Probably about 12 foot high

2185
01:35:57.645 --> 01:36:00.153
and maybe 13 foot end to end

2186
01:36:00.153 --> 01:36:03.300
that is held between two trees,

2187
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.850
it's blocking one pathway.

2188
01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:08.700
It is covered in fungus, heavy, large fungus.

2189
01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:11.080
Elements of it have spread onto the side

2190
01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.380
to the tree.
SAM: Like a web?

2191
01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:15.328
MARISHA: Or like a hive?
MATT: Like a giant cocoon.

2192
01:36:15.328 --> 01:36:19.240
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: It's, oh, oh.

2193
01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.281
I look around and then, like--

2194
01:36:20.281 --> 01:36:23.350
TRAVIS: Anything with See Invisibility or Divine Sense?

2195
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:26.750
MATT: Nothing with See Invisibility,
nothing with Divine Sense.

2196
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:30.610
MARISHA: Wasps, flying creatures, flying things, flying--

2197
01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:32.323
MATT: Make a perception check.

2198
01:36:32.323 --> 01:36:34.896
(groaning)

2199
01:36:34.896 --> 01:36:36.346
TRAVIS: Dirt pile is the new chair.

2200
01:36:36.346 --> 01:36:40.353
MARISHA: Why am I rolling like ball sacks tonight?

2201
01:36:40.353 --> 01:36:41.797
Nine.

2202
01:36:41.797 --> 01:36:43.647
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: How do ball sacks roll?

2203
01:36:43.647 --> 01:36:45.540
SAM: Not very well.
MARISHA: Garbage, clearly.

2204
01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:46.989
They have no grip.

2205
01:36:46.989 --> 01:36:49.298
(laughter)

2206
01:36:49.298 --> 01:36:51.830
TRAVIS: I mean, they actually do have--

2207
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:52.810
MARISHA: I don't know.
TALIESIN: It's true.

2208
01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:54.740
MARISHA: I don't have one. (laughs)

2209
01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.200
MATT: Depends on how well it's kept.

2210
01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.316
MARISHA: I can do kegels.

2211
01:36:57.316 --> 01:36:58.757
(laughter)

2212
01:36:58.757 --> 01:37:01.182
It's not bad, it's not bad grip.

2213
01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:02.714
(laughter)

2214
01:37:02.714 --> 01:37:05.596
Just saying.
TRAVIS: Shit's devolving.

2215
01:37:05.596 --> 01:37:07.065
MATT: Anyway.
MARISHA: What is it?

2216
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:10.630
MATT: You don't see anything wasp-like,

2217
01:37:10.630 --> 01:37:13.010
you don't see any nests or hives or anything

2218
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:18.010
in the vicinity, just the standard continuing of,

2219
01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.540
but the fungus, the fungus is

2220
01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:22.320
growing more dense in some places.

2221
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.260
You can see smaller patches of this wax

2222
01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:28.480
and that one large cocoon-type wax structure

2223
01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.230
that you can see between the two trees.

2224
01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:32.970
TRAVIS: Somebody light that thing up.

2225
01:37:32.970 --> 01:37:35.960
LAURA: Ooh, maybe just like a little bit of fire

2226
01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.690
to see how the wax is when it melts?

2227
01:37:38.690 --> 01:37:41.410
TALIESIN: That seems--
LIAM: Well,

2228
01:37:41.410 --> 01:37:42.940
I could go more precise, but I would have to

2229
01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.470
get right up to it or I could throw a little bit

2230
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:48.040
from a distance.
TRAVIS: ♪ From a distance. ♪

2231
01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.390
LAURA: Well, maybe don't do the middle of it or anything.

2232
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:51.540
Just, like, look for a little

2233
01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:54.560
open patch of wax and see what it does.

2234
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.393
You know.

2235
01:37:55.393 --> 01:37:58.910
SAM: We're just going to burn a bees nest?

2236
01:37:58.910 --> 01:38:00.370
A cocoon of some sort?

2237
01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:02.120
TALIESIN: Seems like a foolish thing to do.

2238
01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.710
Is Decompose touch or is there some distance to it?

2239
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:09.450
LAURA: It's touch.
MATT: If you want to

2240
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.500
look it up real fast, yeah.

2241
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.658
TALIESIN: That's actually a fair point.

2242
01:38:12.658 --> 01:38:15.741
I'm going to look it up--
SAM: Roll, testicle.

2243
01:38:15.741 --> 01:38:17.452
LAURA: Roll.
TALIESIN: Stop it.

2244
01:38:17.452 --> 01:38:18.818
(singing)

2245
01:38:18.818 --> 01:38:21.600
MATT: Goddammit, you guys.
TALIESIN: It is touch, never mind.

2246
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.370
LIAM: Scrote, scrote--
TALIESIN: Um.

2247
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:25.440
(laughter)

2248
01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.273
Yeah.

2249
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:30.030
There's no movement coming from any of this,

2250
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:32.769
there's no shifting?
MATT: Not that you can tell, no.

2251
01:38:32.769 --> 01:38:34.480
MATT: (lip popping)

2252
01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.197
LAURA: The dirt pile,

2253
01:38:38.650 --> 01:38:41.500
what if there's, like, are there any holes in the ground

2254
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.620
that we can see where, like, the dirt would've come from,

2255
01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.703
like it's been displaced?

2256
01:38:46.703 --> 01:38:49.686
MATT: Around it? Not necessarily.

2257
01:38:49.686 --> 01:38:52.536
LAURA: What if I go over and I move the dirt out of the way?

2258
01:38:52.536 --> 01:38:54.000
Is there a hole in the ground?

2259
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.670
MATT: Jester walks up to the mound and starts shifting

2260
01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:58.530
large amounts of the dirt out of the way.

2261
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:03.259
It does continue below.

2262
01:39:03.259 --> 01:39:06.113
The soft, clean earth

2263
01:39:06.113 --> 01:39:10.663
goes a bit deeper beneath just the surface of the jungle.

2264
01:39:11.775 --> 01:39:13.670
SAM: Like you.
MATT: Aww.

2265
01:39:15.092 --> 01:39:18.810
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over and help her just--

2266
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:19.810
MATT: You push back quite a bit.

2267
01:39:19.810 --> 01:39:21.410
It takes you a little while to do so,

2268
01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:23.360
probably about 20 or so minutes to

2269
01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.545
fully remove it from the top because it's--
TALIESIN: Is it all just red

2270
01:39:25.545 --> 01:39:27.150
or is there any other color?

2271
01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:29.710
MATT: It's all red and it's all clean.

2272
01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:33.390
It is lacking in any sort of the other bits of

2273
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:35.500
vegetation and organic matter that you see

2274
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.250
suffuse the dirt around it in the ground.

2275
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:38.630
LAURA: What does it smell like?

2276
01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:40.390
Does it smell like regular old dirt?

2277
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:43.860
MATT: It does, it does.
TALIESIN: When I touch it

2278
01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.850
and if I put my hand into it and I cast Decompose,

2279
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:48.700
does anything, do I feel any--

2280
01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:50.080
MATT: Nothing.

2281
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.155
It is pure, clean, red earth.

2282
01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:56.430
LIAM: I wonder if we're dealing with some sort of oversized

2283
01:39:56.430 --> 01:40:00.780
earthworm or the like, chewing its way through and cleaning

2284
01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:04.450
what it leaves behind.
TALIESIN: I don't, hm.

2285
01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:06.050
Maybe not.
LIAM: Did you see if it goes down a bit?

2286
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:08.616
Have you dug in a ways?

2287
01:40:08.616 --> 01:40:11.331
ASHLEY: Yeah, I got pretty far.

2288
01:40:11.331 --> 01:40:13.443
I wonder would happen if you got in it.

2289
01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:17.120
LAURA: That far down?
MATT: Far down?

2290
01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:21.886
You get down about three feet and it's still going.

2291
01:40:21.886 --> 01:40:23.739
LAURA: Whoa.

2292
01:40:23.739 --> 01:40:27.075
LIAM: We cannot make out what is in this giant gob

2293
01:40:27.075 --> 01:40:28.920
of wax you have described here?

2294
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.310
MATT: Not at this instance, no.
LIAM: No.

2295
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:32.360
TRAVIS: If only we had, like, a capuchin monkey

2296
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.920
that would dig down into this hole and--

2297
01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.020
SAM: Want me to go look at this thing?

2298
01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.620
LIAM: Or we could completely go around it.

2299
01:40:43.363 --> 01:40:44.660
TRAVIS: Look at the big waxy cocoon.

2300
01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:45.730
No one's going to poke the thing?

2301
01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:47.957
LAURA: What if it has to do with you, Caduceus?

2302
01:40:47.957 --> 01:40:49.466
What if the cocoon has to do with you?

2303
01:40:49.466 --> 01:40:51.249
TRAVIS: Shoot one of your ol' fucking arrows at it.

2304
01:40:51.249 --> 01:40:53.457
SAM: Sure, I'll shoot an arrow--
LAURA: What? At the cocoon?

2305
01:40:53.457 --> 01:40:54.841
TALIESIN: I don't know if that's a good idea.
SAM: Why?

2306
01:40:54.841 --> 01:40:57.310
It's just going to, I mean, there's either

2307
01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:59.790
something in there or not.
TRAVIS: I totally agree.

2308
01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:01.360
MATT: You're shooting a bolt into it?

2309
01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.800
SAM: Well, I'll wait 'til I have quorum.

2310
01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.110
TALIESIN: This is a holy site.
MARISHA: What?

2311
01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:07.351
TALIESIN: This is a place of death.

2312
01:41:07.351 --> 01:41:08.768
MARISHA: Oh okay, well then I'm not going to do it.

2313
01:41:08.768 --> 01:41:12.140
MARISHA: How do you know that?
TALIESIN: This is where I'm going.

2314
01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.920
LAURA: So--
MARISHA: All of this is a holy place?

2315
01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.340
SAM: This is your place?
TALIESIN: We're not there yet, but--

2316
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.622
MARISHA: Well, then it's not a holy place.

2317
01:41:20.622 --> 01:41:22.940
(laughter)

2318
01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:24.800
TALIESIN: This may be part of it.

2319
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.460
LAURA: Well, what are we supposed to do with it?

2320
01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:28.917
What does your old story say?

2321
01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.560
TALIESIN: They don't talk about it.

2322
01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:35.335
MARISHA: Should we shoot it or not, Caduceus?

2323
01:41:35.335 --> 01:41:39.200
LIAM: While everyone is debating,
Frumpkin, on two legs, just slowly stumbled up

2324
01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.210
while they debated and it's already there

2325
01:41:41.210 --> 01:41:44.640
and I'm going to have him just crawl up a bit and go--

2326
01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.040
TRAVIS: To the waxy cocoon?
LIAM: Yeah.

2327
01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:48.633
TRAVIS: I love it.
MATT: It taps.

2328
01:41:48.633 --> 01:41:50.910
It's a hard waxy shell.

2329
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:52.987
There's a lot of fungus around.

2330
01:41:54.010 --> 01:41:55.910
LAURA: Is it all that same kind of fungus

2331
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:57.950
or is it all different kinds?

2332
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:59.320
MATT: It's the same kind of purplish-blue

2333
01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.870
fungus, just much larger.

2334
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:03.020
It's in patches, it's not completely covering it,

2335
01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.885
but a lot of it, probably about 60% or 70% of it,

2336
01:42:05.885 --> 01:42:08.150
is covered by pieces of it.
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to

2337
01:42:08.150 --> 01:42:11.330
a little bit of it and put out my staff and:

2338
01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.830
Do you play well with others?

2339
01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:20.140
I'm going to invite it into my staff

2340
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:24.081
to see if they get along.

2341
01:42:24.081 --> 01:42:26.381
MATT: It doesn't seem to respond.

2342
01:42:28.130 --> 01:42:30.270
TALIESIN: Interesting.
SAM: Oh well.

2343
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:32.020
LIAM: It doesn't respond to Frumpkin's skittering

2344
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:34.810
all over it, knocking on it with his little monkey paws?

2345
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.668
MATT: Frumpkin isn't skittering through.

2346
01:42:37.668 --> 01:42:39.917
Do you want Frumpkin to physically jostle the fungus?

2347
01:42:39.917 --> 01:42:42.210
LIAM: He could cover it up and yeah, just give a little.

2348
01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.440
MATT: Mmkay.
LIAM: See if it does anything.

2349
01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.880
MATT: Frumpkin gives a heavy jostle

2350
01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.870
to one of the larger mushrooms, the caps there,

2351
01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.610
and it pulls back in a little bit,

2352
01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:55.640
it recoils slightly.
LIAM: Yeah?

2353
01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.840
MTT: Then (wheezes) this cloud of spores

2354
01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.170
(dispersing)--
MARISHA: Caduceus.

2355
01:43:01.170 --> 01:43:03.490
MATT: Comes out in about a three or four foot range

2356
01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:04.840
from that cap.
MARISHA: Caduceus!

2357
01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:07.860
MATT: Go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw

2358
01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.370
for Frumpkin.
LIAM: I'm sure that'll go well.

2359
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:12.030
LAURA: We're not by these spores, right?

2360
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:13.370
We're not close to the spores?

2361
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:17.290
TALIESIN: Don't irritate the fungus.
LAURA: Please don't turn us into--

2362
01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:18.630
LIAM: Constitution, you say?
MATT: Yeah.

2363
01:43:18.630 --> 01:43:19.860
LIAM: 10.
MATT: 10.

2364
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.680
Frumpkin is poisoned.
SAM: Poisoned?

2365
01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:22.822
LAURA: Aww.

2366
01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:24.962
LIAM: Does he take any instant damage or is he--
MATT: No damage.

2367
01:43:24.962 --> 01:43:26.137
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: He's just poisoned.

2368
01:43:26.137 --> 01:43:27.637
LIAM: (hacks)

2369
01:43:27.637 --> 01:43:30.025
MARISHA: Oh, is he going to poof in six seconds?

2370
01:43:30.025 --> 01:43:31.620
LIAM: No, if there's no damage, he's not.

2371
01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:33.209
MATT: None yet.
LAURA: Some poison does make you

2372
01:43:33.209 --> 01:43:35.760
poop in, like, six seconds.

2373
01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:39.040
TALIESIN: There is talk of a, of an oasis

2374
01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:43.480
in a red and gold veined cave.
LAURA: Red and gold.

2375
01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:46.150
TALIESIN: Maybe this is what that's from.

2376
01:43:46.150 --> 01:43:47.790
They're just stories, is the trouble.

2377
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:49.500
I've never seen it personally.

2378
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.480
LAURA: Don't oasises usually have water?

2379
01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.313
TALIESIN: They do.

2380
01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.070
LAURA: Hmm.

2381
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:58.370
MARISHA: But red and gold?
TALIESIN: Red and gold.

2382
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:59.920
LAURA: I don't see any gold, though.

2383
01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:03.220
MARISHA: But red like the soil?
TALIESIN: Red like the soil.

2384
01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.622
LAURA: What if we melt the wax and it turns, like, yellow?

2385
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.740
TALIESIN: I don't think that's--

2386
01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:10.990
MARISHA: I don't know, she's got a point.

2387
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:13.890
TRAVIS: Isn't it a problem if Frumpkin is poisoned and--

2388
01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:17.050
LIAM: Well, he has never been poisoned, I don't know.

2389
01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:17.883
Are you okay?

2390
01:44:18.721 --> 01:44:20.481
MATT: (monkey cooing)

2391
01:44:20.481 --> 01:44:21.718
(vomiting)

2392
01:44:21.718 --> 01:44:22.789
(groaning)

2393
01:44:22.789 --> 01:44:24.710
TRAVIS: I'll call Frumpkin over and I'll

2394
01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:27.210
Lay on Hands for Frumpkin and--

2395
01:44:27.210 --> 01:44:30.210
LIAM: He leaps onto Caduceus' staff and fireman down

2396
01:44:30.210 --> 01:44:31.650
and then scurries over to Fjord.

2397
01:44:31.650 --> 01:44:35.060
TRAVIS: I will use Lay on Hands
for the first time and neutralize a poison.

2398
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.780
MATT: All right.
SAM: You can do that?

2399
01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:38.463
LAURA: What?
MATT: So you use

2400
01:44:38.463 --> 01:44:39.870
five points of your-- I think it's five, right?

2401
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:41.640
Five hit points of your--
LAURA: Use that many?

2402
01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:43.820
How many times can you do that a day?

2403
01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.086
MATT: Twice, technically, I think because

2404
01:44:45.086 --> 01:44:46.760
it's five per level.
LAURA: You wasted it on Frumpkin.

2405
01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:48.350
What if one of us gets poisoned?

2406
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:49.590
SAM: He's an animal lover.

2407
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:51.872
TRAVIS: Frumpkin takes chances, I like that.

2408
01:44:51.872 --> 01:44:54.090
(laughter)

2409
01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:58.445
LAURA: Sprinkle, go check out that pile of waxy stuff.

2410
01:44:58.445 --> 01:45:00.004
(laughter)

2411
01:45:00.004 --> 01:45:02.840
MATT: (weasel chittering)

2412
01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.970
Sprinkle, who's still poofed up like this

2413
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:07.600
furred collar around the back of Jester's head,

2414
01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.900
just recoils deeper into her coat

2415
01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:12.561
like (weasel hissing).

2416
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:14.039
LAURA: He's not going to do it.

2417
01:45:14.039 --> 01:45:15.285
(laughter)

2418
01:45:15.285 --> 01:45:17.777
MATT: Do you guys want to keep moving?
What do you want to do?

2419
01:45:17.777 --> 01:45:20.200
LIAM: Did that cure Frumpkin's poison?

2420
01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.320
MATT: Yeah, Frumpkin is no longer poisoned.

2421
01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.660
LIAM: Oh hey, you are with Fjord today.

2422
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:26.290
He skitters up the leg all the way up to the top

2423
01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:28.490
and sits on his shoulder.
LAURA: Caduceus, you tell us.

2424
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:29.500
What do you want us to do here?

2425
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.490
Do you us to leave it alone, do you want us to keep going?

2426
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:33.590
Do you want us fuck with this cocoon thing or what?

2427
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:35.240
TALIESIN: My instinct is to leave it alone,

2428
01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.073
but--
SAM: All right, then.

2429
01:45:36.073 --> 01:45:37.840
Let's keep going.
LAURA: Let's keep going.

2430
01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:40.301
MATT: Okay.

2431
01:45:40.301 --> 01:45:42.320
SAM: But it's good imagery

2432
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.920
for your religion.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

2433
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:48.240
I'm writing down all of these things.

2434
01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.630
SAM: Where the wax drips large.

2435
01:45:50.630 --> 01:45:52.240
TRAVIS: You don't want to melt the waxy cocoon

2436
01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.150
to see what's underneath it?
LAURA: I mean, I do.

2437
01:45:54.150 --> 01:45:56.420
LIAM: Get some distance from it--
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

2438
01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:58.710
back up.
LIAM: Let's get like,

2439
01:45:58.710 --> 01:46:01.290
yeah, you know, 50 or 60 feet back.

2440
01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:02.400
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: But what if

2441
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.060
it has to do with Caduceus' stuff

2442
01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.270
and then we ruin his whole family religion?

2443
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:09.160
LIAM: Well, you are leading this expedition, so really.

2444
01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.383
What do you want to do here?

2445
01:46:10.383 --> 01:46:13.380
TALIESIN: If you want to take a look inside from a distance,

2446
01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.640
I will trust your judgment.

2447
01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:17.056
I've, honestly,

2448
01:46:17.056 --> 01:46:19.198
I'm not an expert--
TRAVIS: That's very generous of you, we do.

2449
01:46:19.198 --> 01:46:22.213
TALIESIN: I'm not an expert here, I just know what I know.

2450
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:25.740
LIAM: Okay, well I will start by just taking 30 seconds

2451
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.410
to throw three or four Fire Bolts.

2452
01:46:28.410 --> 01:46:30.360
<i>Bolts.</i>
MATT: Okay.

2453
01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.450
It's a large enough target where you

2454
01:46:31.450 --> 01:46:33.440
don't need to worry about rolling for it necessarily.

2455
01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.650
You just launch it and (flying Fire Bolts)

2456
01:46:35.650 --> 01:46:37.897
and they slam into it like this

2457
01:46:37.897 --> 01:46:39.690
tiny fiery missiles, these (impacts).

2458
01:46:39.690 --> 01:46:42.870
As it impacts, the first one hits further up

2459
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:44.810
and exposes some of the wax, immediately

2460
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:46.410
breaks off and melts at the same time

2461
01:46:46.410 --> 01:46:48.695
and you can see a bit of darker

2462
01:46:48.695 --> 01:46:52.130
reddish-brown fur exposed, though matted.

2463
01:46:53.967 --> 01:46:57.290
One of the following ones hits the midsection

2464
01:46:57.290 --> 01:47:01.300
and as it hits, the wax melts away,

2465
01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.451
leaving a hole, and immediately, (glugging liquid)

2466
01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:07.005
some liquid begins to just pour out of it.

2467
01:47:07.005 --> 01:47:08.973
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: Some kind of

2468
01:47:08.973 --> 01:47:13.400
mildly greenish, blackish, thick,

2469
01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.440
sludge-like liquid that's spilling out of the hole

2470
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.338
down the side of the wax, over the mushrooms and go down.

2471
01:47:20.338 --> 01:47:22.447
SAM: A pupa of some kind?

2472
01:47:22.447 --> 01:47:25.021
MARISHA: Slurpee suicide!

2473
01:47:25.021 --> 01:47:26.887
LAURA: Did we kill it? Are we killing something?

2474
01:47:26.887 --> 01:47:29.150
SAM: It could be a baby that's growing in there.

2475
01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:30.570
TRAVIS: I think it's decomposing.

2476
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:32.490
TALIESIN: I think it's just decomposing.

2477
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:34.840
MATT: Now the smell hits you.
ALL: Ugh.

2478
01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.315
MATT: An extremely grotesque,

2479
01:47:38.315 --> 01:47:41.830
strong, putrid decay.

2480
01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.820
As you can see, as the wax melts

2481
01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:48.960
and the liquid comes to spill out of it,

2482
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.490
you get the sense that whatever was captured in there,

2483
01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.560
based on the acid damage you saw on the bones earlier,

2484
01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:59.260
has been slowly dissolving inside this cocoon

2485
01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.140
and what has been dissolving has now been

2486
01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:03.320
pouring out of the hole that you left in its side.

2487
01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.500
LIAM: So there was a little bit of fur left at the top

2488
01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:07.240
but further down, ♪ further down ♪--

2489
01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:08.720
MATT: You still don't know quite what this creature is,

2490
01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.290
you've only exposed little elements of it,

2491
01:48:10.290 --> 01:48:12.430
but the smell is awful.
LAURA: But the creature is

2492
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:13.480
really big.
MATT: Most of you guys begin

2493
01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.330
to start just heaving.
TALIESIN: We should head out.

2494
01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:17.630
MATT: The creature is big.
LAURA: And whatever it was

2495
01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:20.164
that did this is even bigger. (gags)

2496
01:48:20.164 --> 01:48:22.090
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: We're going to keep marching.

2497
01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:25.098
TRAVIS: Let's go!
LIAM: How was that for a prank?

2498
01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:26.330
MATT: You continue on your path and--

2499
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:30.910
MARISHA: While we walk, I keep an eye towards the canopy,

2500
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:32.510
just to make sure.
MATT: Okay.

2501
01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:38.673
I would say Caduceus and Jester,

2502
01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.600
you would begin to hear, as you guys move on

2503
01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.960
about 30, 40, 50 feet from this,

2504
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.990
trying to get away from the smell,

2505
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:48.930
and the smell seems to be chasing you,

2506
01:48:48.930 --> 01:48:52.250
it's just filling this area of the jungle,

2507
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:57.180
you begin to hear like a (clicking).

2508
01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.176
LAURA: Oh no.

2509
01:49:00.176 --> 01:49:02.626
MATT: A little ways off in the distance.
TRAVIS: Ah, wildlife.

2510
01:49:02.626 --> 01:49:04.045
MARISHA: We're going to get cocooned.
MATT: (chittering and clicking)

2511
01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:07.858
And you start hearing bushes shifting.

2512
01:49:07.858 --> 01:49:11.210
TALIESIN: -- to hide behind trees in the opposite direction

2513
01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:13.970
to prepare.
LAURA: We should hide?

2514
01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:15.820
We should hide.
AM: Okay, I'll hide.

2515
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:19.030
MARISHA: We're hiding?
LAURA: In the trees?

2516
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:20.140
Not on the ground.

2517
01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:22.140
It's probably going to come--

2518
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:26.380
MATT: You hear distant ferns and bushes and leaves

2519
01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:28.940
and other elements of the forest floor being jostled

2520
01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:31.470
and moved just outside of your perimeter.

2521
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:33.483
MARISHA: Is it--
MATT: (rustling)

2522
01:49:33.483 --> 01:49:35.379
TRAVIS: I'm going to light up the sword.

2523
01:49:35.379 --> 01:49:37.580
MATT: The sword lights up.

2524
01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:40.260
You hear (skittering) a heavy wood sound

2525
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.890
and you see, just out of the right side

2526
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:45.980
of where you are, Caduceus, you see these

2527
01:49:47.130 --> 01:49:49.280
bladed legs (skittering)

2528
01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:51.600
climb up the side of a tree and just curve around to look.

2529
01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.410
You see roughly the size of

2530
01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:59.047
a wolverine or a large badger,

2531
01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.485
but its body is this

2532
01:50:02.485 --> 01:50:05.630
chitinous insect-like plates,

2533
01:50:05.630 --> 01:50:07.475
pale white,

2534
01:50:09.424 --> 01:50:13.480
almost translucent, its legs

2535
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.880
coming to these arched, dagger-like points

2536
01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:18.080
as it climbs up the side of the tree.

2537
01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.530
Its tail goes behind it in this long,

2538
01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:22.180
lobster-like fashion that

2539
01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:24.340
comes into two pincer-like blades.

2540
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:26.160
You cannot see where a face would be,

2541
01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.870
it's just a bald, armored front,

2542
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:31.210
and it (insect chitter)--

2543
01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:32.660
SAM and LIAM: Ugh.
MATT: (skittering),

2544
01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:35.266
and then disappears up into the tree.

2545
01:50:35.266 --> 01:50:37.950
You just hear more and more

2546
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:39.711
of the jungle moving around you.

2547
01:50:39.711 --> 01:50:40.944
(groaning)
TALIESIN: Everyone back to back.

2548
01:50:40.944 --> 01:50:43.822
MATT: Drawn, probably, by the exposed smell--

2549
01:50:43.822 --> 01:50:47.250
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: Of a long-simmering meal

2550
01:50:47.250 --> 01:50:48.620
that's now been left to spill

2551
01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:50.980
on the jungle floor.
MARISHA: Back to back!

2552
01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:52.099
MATT: And that's where we're going to go take a break.

2553
01:50:52.099 --> 01:50:54.099
(groaning)

2554
01:50:55.165 --> 01:50:58.333
SAM: Wow.
ASHLEY: Oh, they are so ugly.

2555
01:50:58.333 --> 01:51:00.210
LIAM: It's making me think of those fuzzy millipedes

2556
01:51:00.210 --> 01:51:02.258
that you used to find in the bathroom sometimes.

2557
01:51:02.258 --> 01:51:03.467
You know what I'm talking about?

2558
01:51:03.467 --> 01:51:04.915
MARISHA: Oh god.
LIAM: Ah, gross.

2559
01:51:04.915 --> 01:51:05.977
MARISHA: You mean the--
TRAVIS: Silverfish?

2560
01:51:05.977 --> 01:51:07.347
LAURA: They were just the silverfish?

2561
01:51:07.347 --> 01:51:09.705
MATT: Silverfish. Very much the inspiration here.

2562
01:51:09.705 --> 01:51:11.032
LAURA: You were really, really, really

2563
01:51:11.032 --> 01:51:13.323
hoping we would mess with it, weren't you?

2564
01:51:13.323 --> 01:51:14.156
MATT: Yeah, I was!

2565
01:51:14.156 --> 01:51:16.380
LAURA: It was just sitting there going, "Poke me."

2566
01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:17.320
TALIESIN: You're welcome.
MATT: Yeah.

2567
01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:19.312
Well, that's what I do. I put stuff there
and say, "You can poke me."

2568
01:51:19.312 --> 01:51:20.654
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad.

2569
01:51:20.654 --> 01:51:21.562
(groaning)

2570
01:51:21.562 --> 01:51:23.395
You guys almost left it. I was like, "All right, cool.

2571
01:51:23.395 --> 01:51:24.870
"We're going to skip this encounter."

2572
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:26.000
TALIESIN: I'm not going to pretend I didn't know

2573
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.730
how this was going to end.
MATT: Of course, of course.

2574
01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:29.210
TRAVIS: See what's in the corner of that video game--

2575
01:51:29.210 --> 01:51:32.420
LIAM: You just need to poke that chair
just a little bit longer.

2576
01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:34.340
MATT: Sometimes you get information, sometimes you get loot,

2577
01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:35.880
sometimes you get cool encounters,

2578
01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:38.240
sometimes you draw a bunch of creatures your way.

2579
01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:39.350
LAURA: Oh god.

2580
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:40.580
MATT: We have our Wyrmwood giveaway tonight.

2581
01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.040
MATT: The fantastic purpleheart dice vault.

2582
01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:47.030
Outstanding wood, special, goes to one lucky winner tonight.

2583
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:50.760
The keyword tonight is gateway, one word, gateway.

2584
01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.370
Enter it once and once only.

2585
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:53.760
More than once will be disqualified.

2586
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:55.590
Once again, for people in the US

2587
01:51:55.590 --> 01:51:58.370
and Canada only, excluding Quebec.

2588
01:51:58.370 --> 01:52:01.120
We'll come back here shortly with the winner

2589
01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.480
and the rest of tonight's session.

2590
01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.990
See you soon.
TRAVIS: Chicka-chick-ah.

LIAM: We're talking about ghosts
today, ladies and gentlemen.

2626
01:54:13.487 --> 01:54:14.430
SAM: We are talking about ghosts.

2627
01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:15.263
SAM: Ghosts.

2628
01:54:15.263 --> 01:54:16.096
BRIDGET: Ghosts.

2629
01:54:16.096 --> 01:54:17.120
LIAM: Otherworldly. Ghost.

2630
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:17.990
SAM: Ghost.

2631
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.980
Ghosts.
LIAM: Ghost.

2632
01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:20.050
SAM: Ghost.
LIAM: Forget ghosts

2633
01:54:20.050 --> 01:54:21.480
because this is the real--
LAURA: Ghosts.

2634
01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:22.440
BRIDGET: There is--
LIAM: Ghosts,

2635
01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.440
like that's my ghosts.
SAM: Oh my god.

2636
01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.760
Ghosts. Ghost. Ghosts.
BRIDGET: Ghost.

2637
01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:25.840
SAM: Ghost, Ghost.

2638
01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:26.800
Ghost.
LIAM: Ghost.

2639
01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.490
DAVID: Ghost.
SAM: Lionel Richie's pre-ghost.

2640
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:29.330
Ghosts?
BRIDGET: Yes.

2641
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:30.200
LIAM: Ghosts?
DAVID: Yes.

2642
01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.260
LAURA: Ghosts.

2643
01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:32.093
SAM: Ghosts.
LAURA: Ghosts.

2644
01:54:32.093 --> 01:54:35.294
DAVID: That's a ghost, that's a ghost, that's another ghost.

2645
01:54:35.294 --> 01:54:36.710
There's a ghost, there's a ghost, there's a ghost.

2646
01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:37.800
BRIDGET: Should I should move or should I stay?

2647
01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:38.830
LIAM: Ghosts.
SAM: Ghosts.

2648
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:40.830
Ghosts don't make complete sentences.

2649
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:43.010
Ghost.
LIAM: Ghost. Ghosts. Ghost.

2650
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:45.080
Yum yum. (speaks in a ghostly language)

2651
01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.543
SAM: Ghost cigarette?

2652
01:54:46.543 --> 01:54:49.380
(yelling)

2653
01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:50.990
Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts.

2654
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:52.015
What do I do?
BRIDGET: A ghost.

2655
01:54:52.015 --> 01:54:52.848
Ghost.
LAURA: Ghost.

2656
01:54:52.848 --> 01:54:53.980
SAM: (yelling)

2657
01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:55.500
LAURA: Sam!
BRIDGET: You ran right through it!

2658
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.070
SAM: I killed a ghost?

2659
01:54:57.070 --> 01:54:58.680
BRIDGET: You killed a ghost.
OFF-CAMERA: Is he still there?

2660
01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.576
SAM: I killed a ghost.

2661
01:54:59.576 --> 01:55:02.826
(tubular upbeat music)

2662
01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.180
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

2663
01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:14.377
BRIAN: Who got--
LAURA: Stupefy.

2664
01:55:15.546 --> 01:55:17.164
(laughter)

2665
01:55:17.164 --> 01:55:18.114
BRIAN: It didn't work--
LAURA: Dude--

2666
01:55:18.114 --> 01:55:20.130
BRIAN: I'm already stupid.
LAURA: We're teaching Ronin

2667
01:55:20.130 --> 01:55:21.685
how to use The Force.
SAM: Oh!

2668
01:55:21.685 --> 01:55:22.610
BRIAN: The Force?
LAURA: Yeah.

2669
01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:23.976
BRIAN: Oh yeah, he did it on me the other day.

2670
01:55:23.976 --> 01:55:25.150
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
BRIAN: Yeah, yeah, he did it on me.

2671
01:55:25.150 --> 01:55:27.360
SAM: Does he Force push?
BRIAN: Yeah, yeah, he pushes.

2672
01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.350
LAURA: He goes (grunts)--

2673
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:30.620
BRIAN: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Right now.

2674
01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:31.860
Yeah.
BRIAN: And I will literally

2675
01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:34.230
fly across the house to make him laugh

2676
01:55:34.230 --> 01:55:35.180
because--
LAURA: Yeah.

2677
01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:36.690
BRIAN: That's what uncles are for.

2678
01:55:36.690 --> 01:55:38.740
You would know if you didn't have the restraining order.

2679
01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:41.790
SAM: Well, I'm spending too much time with

2680
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:45.362
pets that I love.
BRIAN: Mm-hmm, sure, yeah.

2681
01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:49.470
Oh boy.
SAM: Back and forth, right?

2682
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:51.362
BRIAN: Oh yeah, mm-hmm.
SAM: That's how you pet.

2683
01:55:51.362 --> 01:55:52.869
LAURA: Your hand up, other side.

2684
01:55:52.869 --> 01:55:54.860
SAM: Ah.
BRIAN: No, no no, no no.

2685
01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:56.918
LAURA: No, no, no.
BRIAN: Oh.

2686
01:55:56.918 --> 01:56:00.080
LAURA: That was creepy, nothing else was.

2687
01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:01.610
BRIAN: Okay, stand by.

2688
01:56:01.610 --> 01:56:03.510
ArseQueef, you up?

2689
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:05.370
Okay, there we go.

2690
01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:09.720
Seedy88 wants to know: "How much of Jester's plan

2691
01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.470
"had you worked out prior to speaking to Isharnai?

2692
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:16.561
"What parts did you have to change on the fly?"

2693
01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:18.890
LAURA: I think it during Beau's talk.

2694
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:22.700
SAM: I saw you pull it out
and I knew something was happening.

2695
01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:23.730
LAURA: Yeah?
SAM: Yeah.

2696
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:26.660
Yeah, there was even a moment when fucking Taliesin

2697
01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:28.340
and I think also Marisha were like,

2698
01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:29.964
"Well, I'm going to go up and--"

2699
01:56:29.964 --> 01:56:32.975
and I was like, "Ah, (shushing noises).

2700
01:56:32.975 --> 01:56:35.107
"She's doing her thing. Fuck off.

2701
01:56:35.107 --> 01:56:36.165
"She's got something."
LAURA: Which is crazy

2702
01:56:36.165 --> 01:56:37.542
because I feel like Taliesin should've

2703
01:56:37.542 --> 01:56:38.944
had an idea what I was going to do

2704
01:56:38.944 --> 01:56:40.740
because I had been leaning over to Tal,

2705
01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:44.490
whispering, going, "Do you have Bane prepared?"

2706
01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:45.980
Because if he had Bane prepared,

2707
01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:47.740
because I forgot I had the dust until

2708
01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:50.060
and I was trying to figure out a way to get her wisdom down

2709
01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:51.710
so that I could do the Modify Memory.

2710
01:56:51.710 --> 01:56:55.810
BRIAN: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: But I didn't have a back up.

2711
01:56:55.810 --> 01:56:57.860
Basically, if it had failed,

2712
01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:59.650
I probably would have died.
BRIAN: Okay.

2713
01:56:59.650 --> 01:57:01.560
"Did you plan for the Traveler

2714
01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:04.790
"to be Artagan or was it Matt's idea?

2715
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:07.560
"Did you have a guess as to his true identity before this?"

2716
01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.393
I know the answer to this because

2717
01:57:08.393 --> 01:57:09.770
I asked you.
LAURA: I know.

2718
01:57:10.665 --> 01:57:14.093
Yeah, I did know. But here's the thing: so--

2719
01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:15.683
SAM: Was it your idea?
LAURA: It was.

2720
01:57:15.683 --> 01:57:18.272
SAM: (gasps) You're so brilliant!

2721
01:57:18.272 --> 01:57:20.140
BRIAN: That's what we've been trying to tell you, Sam.

2722
01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.894
LAURA: But, so-- I'm wearing my Traveler Con hoodie.

2723
01:57:22.894 --> 01:57:25.005
DANI: Ooh.
BRIAN: Available now.

2724
01:57:25.005 --> 01:57:27.122
LAURA: Hey.
BRIAN: Shop.critrole.com.

2725
01:57:27.122 --> 01:57:29.300
LAURA: No, because I have mentioned on this show before

2726
01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:32.891
that my original plan was to make a warlock

2727
01:57:32.891 --> 01:57:35.591
and I was going to make a warlock

2728
01:57:35.591 --> 01:57:38.982
with the fey pact to Artagan

2729
01:57:38.982 --> 01:57:40.705
and then I was going to have the book--

2730
01:57:40.705 --> 01:57:42.110
BRIAN: Artágan's how you pronounce it?

2731
01:57:42.110 --> 01:57:45.037
LAURA: I know! I thought it was Árt-uh-gan.

2732
01:57:45.037 --> 01:57:46.655
But no, I heard Matt saying its Artágan.

2733
01:57:46.655 --> 01:57:48.100
SAM: Artágan.
LAURA: I know!

2734
01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:49.910
BRIAN: I can't believe I've been pronouncing that wrong

2735
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:50.743
this whole time--
LAURA: There's a thing called the

2736
01:57:50.743 --> 01:57:53.460
book pact or something like that

2737
01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:56.230
and I was like, "What a way to worship him is, like,

2738
01:57:56.230 --> 01:57:58.360
"a spell book with lewd drawings in it,

2739
01:57:58.360 --> 01:57:59.640
"that's so perfect."
BRIAN: Yeah.

2740
01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.650
TRAVIS: Then Travis was like, "What, warlock? Okay."

2741
01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:04.190
Then I was like, "Oh shit, I have to be a cleric."

2742
01:58:04.190 --> 01:58:08.640
So I asked Matt, "Can I still have him as my god?"

2743
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:11.460
He's like, "Yeah, we can make it work."

2744
01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:14.870
However, we started the game and then

2745
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:19.250
he just kept being really mysterious about it

2746
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:20.631
and then every time I would have

2747
01:58:20.631 --> 01:58:22.480
an interaction with the Traveler,

2748
01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:24.630
I kept looking at Matt like, "I know who it is."

2749
01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:26.990
He would be, like, looking at me like I was an idiot.

2750
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:28.610
Like, "No, you don't know."

2751
01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:30.240
So I thought he'd changed it

2752
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.230
and he was going to surprise me.

2753
01:58:31.230 --> 01:58:32.810
So the whole time, I've been like,

2754
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:34.280
"It's not him, it's not Artagan.

2755
01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:36.680
"I guess Matt went a different direction,

2756
01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:37.700
"that's totally cool."

2757
01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:40.530
So that was totally genuine when he revealed

2758
01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:43.080
and I saw the hair and I realized it was still him.

2759
01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:45.480
I was like, "Aah!" (laughs)

2760
01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:49.572
BRIAN: "What made you spontaneously
decide to hire a housekeeper?"

2761
01:58:49.572 --> 01:58:51.455
SAM: Well, in-game,

2762
01:58:51.455 --> 01:58:55.188
Nott was concerned with our home

2763
01:58:55.188 --> 01:58:57.129
when we are not there.

2764
01:58:57.129 --> 01:59:01.480
Then Sam Riegel was also remembering

2765
01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:04.100
when we had the Greyskull Keep in the first campaign

2766
01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:06.060
we had fucking staff.

2767
01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:08.960
LAURA: Yeah, I feel like Vox Machina's
the type to have staff.

2768
01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:11.040
Mighty Nein--
DANI: Not so much.

2769
01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.702
LAURA: Less so.
SAM: But it

2770
01:59:12.702 --> 01:59:13.554
makes sense--
BRIAN: Well, a lot of you aren't

2771
01:59:13.554 --> 01:59:15.240
as trusting.
SAM: If we have a house,

2772
01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.220
we should have someone to check in on it.

2773
01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:19.490
That's just basic home ownership.

2774
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:21.710
LAURA: But isn't that, like, they're constantly scrying

2775
01:59:21.710 --> 01:59:23.380
on the house, I bet, so I'm sure

2776
01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:24.840
people are looking at the house.

2777
01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:27.370
SAM: Every homeowner hires someone to watch

2778
01:59:27.370 --> 01:59:28.760
after their house--
BRIAN: No.

2779
01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:29.890
SAM: In the world.
BRIAN: No.

2780
01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:31.070
SAM: Right?
BRIAN: No.

2781
01:59:31.070 --> 01:59:33.090
See? He likes it.
SAM: He likes it.

2782
01:59:33.090 --> 01:59:35.659
BRIAN: Wow, good job.
DANI: That's a good boy.

2783
01:59:35.659 --> 01:59:38.210
LAURA: Dogs know if the person's creepy.
BRIAN: Pretty normal.

2784
01:59:38.210 --> 01:59:39.980
LAURA: So that's important that--
BRIAN: That's pretty,

2785
01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:43.265
he is facing away--
SAM: He won't look me in the eye.

2786
01:59:43.265 --> 01:59:45.940
BRIAN: I think with that many teeth,

2787
01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:47.647
he's a little worried about--

2788
01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:50.335
LAURA: Look at Henry, he's just looking at the camera like.

2789
01:59:50.335 --> 01:59:52.017
Like The Office.
SAM: I don't normally

2790
01:59:52.017 --> 01:59:55.440
trust landsharks, but I guess I'll trust this one.

2791
01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:57.900
BRIAN: Yeah, okay.
DANI: What a good boy.

2792
01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.010
BRIAN: Sam, Quinn-Quinn wants to know: "What are Nott's

2793
02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:03.870
"favorite memories with Travis and Ashley?"

2794
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:07.240
These are the names he chose for Nott's parents.

2795
02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.565
Oh no.
SAM: What are Nott's favorite memories

2796
02:00:08.565 --> 02:00:10.174
with Travis and Ashley?

2797
02:00:10.174 --> 02:00:11.660
(laughter)

2798
02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:15.250
Oh, well, you know.
DANI: Enjoy your hubris. (laughs)

2799
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:18.665
SAM: That time that Travis and Ashley

2800
02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.818
took Veth--
BRIAN: Took him to the, took her to the old--

2801
02:00:21.818 --> 02:00:23.977
SAM: -- to-- Man, my hand hurts.

2802
02:00:23.977 --> 02:00:26.720
BRIAN: From petting a dog for 13 seconds?

2803
02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.903
LAURA: Oh my god,

2804
02:00:27.903 --> 02:00:31.129
you've got so many more callouses now, Sam.

2805
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:33.580
All that hard work.
BRIAN: Those lily white hands.

2806
02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:35.297
SAM: Housekeeper!

2807
02:00:35.297 --> 02:00:37.262
Housekeeper, I need you!

2808
02:00:38.412 --> 02:00:41.080
DANI: You don't even know the name of your housekeeper!

2809
02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.378
SAM: Mine--
LAURA: Massage your hand.

2810
02:00:42.378 --> 02:00:43.736
(laughter)

2811
02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.601
SAM: Housekeeper!

2812
02:00:45.601 --> 02:00:48.184
(gentle electronic tones)

2813
02:00:49.121 --> 02:00:52.162
MATT: (as Pumat Sol) (grunts) Oh, well!

2814
02:00:52.162 --> 02:00:53.687
Would you look at that?

2815
02:00:53.687 --> 02:00:55.128
I think it worked.

2816
02:00:55.128 --> 02:00:57.142
You were right, Pumat Number Three.

2817
02:00:57.142 --> 02:01:00.359
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

2818
02:01:01.197 --> 02:01:02.889
Pumat Number Three?

2819
02:01:05.235 --> 02:01:06.522
Oh boy.

2820
02:01:06.522 --> 02:01:07.900
Well, hello there!

2821
02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:09.380
I'm Pumat Prime.

2822
02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.370
It's good to finally join you here in the Prime Dimension.

2823
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:16.880
I see this is the Twitch Prime realm,

2824
02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:19.960
I think, and the, oh, we're on the

2825
02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.650
Critical Role channel, aren't we?

2826
02:01:21.650 --> 02:01:23.100
Well, would you look at that?

2827
02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:25.590
You got chat and everything.

2828
02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:27.682
Respectfully, I was looking for the

2829
02:01:27.682 --> 02:01:31.950
prime rib realm, but this isn't too bad.

2830
02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:34.350
You see, if you already have access to

2831
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:37.240
the Amazon Prime realm, you can get a free subscription

2832
02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.110
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

2833
02:01:40.110 --> 02:01:41.680
The two realms have a pretty good

2834
02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:44.120
working relationship after that peace treaty

2835
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.030
the Prime Minister signed a few years back.

2836
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:49.080
You just have to remember to renew

2837
02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:50.600
your Twitch Prime subscription at

2838
02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.830
the top of each month, respectfully.

2839
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:55.860
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

2840
02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:57.650
you can spread the joy by gifting

2841
02:01:57.650 --> 02:02:01.140
a subscription using the Gift A Sub button.

2842
02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:03.320
That is, assuming the Empire hasn't

2843
02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:08.230
sent a taxman to your shoppe recently. (chuckles)

2844
02:02:08.230 --> 02:02:09.540
All right, well, I'm off to find

2845
02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:11.910
that darn elusive prime rib realm.

2846
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:14.810
Who knew the Prime Dimension had so many pockets?

2847
02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:17.861
Good luck. (chuckles)

2848
02:02:17.861 --> 02:02:19.115
(receding footsteps)

2849
02:02:19.115 --> 02:02:21.063
Pumat Three!

2850
02:02:21.063 --> 02:02:23.610
(gentle music)

2851
02:02:23.610 --> 02:02:25.185
TALIESIN (V.O.): Subscribe.

2852
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:29.057
Re-subscribe.

2853
02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:34.110
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

2854
02:02:37.935 --> 02:02:40.685
(dramatic music)

2855
02:15:32.462 --> 02:15:34.392
MATT: And welcome back.

2856
02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:35.670
You're getting lazy.

2857
02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:38.007
(laughter)

2858
02:15:38.007 --> 02:15:39.997
TALIESIN: I wanted that one to hang.
MATT: Good.

2859
02:15:39.997 --> 02:15:41.313
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: Welcome back.

2860
02:15:41.313 --> 02:15:43.940
So first, we have our winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway.

2861
02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:48.457
The winner is 19infectious19.

2862
02:15:48.457 --> 02:15:51.720
SAM: 19infectious19.
MATT: 19infectious19.

2863
02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:54.120
Congratulations, we'll get that sent out to you ASAP.

2864
02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:55.581
LIAM: That was a good year.
MATT: It was.

2865
02:15:55.581 --> 02:15:58.364
(laughter)
TRAVIS: We just said Beetlejuice's name twice.

2866
02:15:58.364 --> 02:15:59.680
MARISHA: Oh my god. (laughs)
MATT: So.

2867
02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:01.610
(laughter)

2868
02:16:01.610 --> 02:16:03.710
You guys have gathered back to back,

2869
02:16:03.710 --> 02:16:05.910
aside from Nott, who, roll stealth for me?

2870
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:07.043
SAM: Oh yeah.

2871
02:16:08.268 --> 02:16:12.926
LIAM: Does she have advantage in
her Traveler illusory cloak?

2872
02:16:12.926 --> 02:16:15.415
MATT: She has advantage because of her cloak anyway.

2873
02:16:15.415 --> 02:16:16.620
LIAM: Right, it's because of the cloak.

2874
02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:18.300
SAM: It was--
MATT: Yes.

2875
02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:19.570
SAM: Oh, why can't I find stealth?

2876
02:16:19.570 --> 02:16:21.750
Oh, there it is, 24.

2877
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:23.150
MATT: Okay, good to know.

2878
02:16:23.150 --> 02:16:26.200
Everyone, roll initiative.
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

2879
02:16:27.667 --> 02:16:28.910
I was going to do that as we were caught up,

2880
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:31.220
but it's fine if I didn't say it.

2881
02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:33.990
MATT: I'll say, I'll say, (sighs)

2882
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:35.940
SAM: Say no.
MATT: I'll say roll initiative.

2883
02:16:37.209 --> 02:16:38.425
SAM: Are we all rolling initiative?

2884
02:16:38.425 --> 02:16:39.466
MATT: You are all rolling initiative.
LIAM: I say, I say.

2885
02:16:40.568 --> 02:16:41.410
TRAVIS: ♪ I say! ♪

2886
02:16:42.492 --> 02:16:44.042
LIAM: I love being last.

2887
02:16:44.042 --> 02:16:45.834
LAURA: You won't be.

2888
02:16:45.834 --> 02:16:46.990
TALIESIN: It's okay.
MATT: All right.

2889
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:49.220
TALIESIN: Healer's got the backpack.
MATT: 25 to 20?

2890
02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:51.770
MARISHA: 24. I want a dry erase marker.
MATT: Beau!

2891
02:16:54.450 --> 02:16:57.320
20 to 15?
TRAVIS: 17.

2892
02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:00.100
Am I the highest?
LAURA: No, Beau is the highest.

2893
02:17:01.370 --> 02:17:02.553
MATT: All right.

2894
02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:06.800
15 to 10?
ASHLEY: Uh, 10.

2895
02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:08.040
SAM: Eight.
LAURA: Oof.

2896
02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:10.070
TRAVIS: Wow, what the fuck, guys?
MARISHA: Oof.

2897
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:11.890
MATT: All right.

2898
02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:13.400
Ten to five?
LIAM: Oh, seven.

2899
02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:14.840
Excuse me.
TALIESIN: Six.

2900
02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.771
LIAM: You did that?
LAURA: Six.

2901
02:17:16.771 --> 02:17:18.300
TALIESIN: Are we both six?
LAURA: Yeah.

2902
02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:19.690
TALIESIN: Shit.
MATT: All right.

2903
02:17:19.690 --> 02:17:21.270
Who has the higher dexterity?

2904
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:23.590
LAURA: Me.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2905
02:17:23.590 --> 02:17:24.550
My dex is 12.

2906
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:26.080
LAURA: What did you roll, Yasha?

2907
02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:28.360
ASHLEY: I rolled a 10.

2908
02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:29.590
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: All righty.

2909
02:17:29.590 --> 02:17:30.423
MARISHA: 100%.

2910
02:17:31.330 --> 02:17:32.163
MATT: So.

2911
02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:36.530
Beginning at this, you've only seen one of

2912
02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:39.450
these creatures that climbed up into this tree.

2913
02:17:41.430 --> 02:17:42.530
Beau, you're up.

2914
02:17:43.705 --> 02:17:46.360
MARISHA: Oh boysies, okay.

2915
02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:48.617
He went up here?
MATT: Up into this tree,

2916
02:17:48.617 --> 02:17:51.530
right here.
MARISHA: Into that tree?

2917
02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:53.670
Do I want to go after him?

2918
02:17:53.670 --> 02:17:54.503
Okay.

2919
02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:57.780
Yeah, yeah, fuck it.

2920
02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:00.510
Let's just go for it, let's just go up the tree.

2921
02:18:00.510 --> 02:18:03.021
LAURA: What?
MARISHA: Yes.

2922
02:18:03.021 --> 02:18:04.080
Yeah.
LAURA: Back to back, Beau!

2923
02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:06.638
Back to--
MARISHA: I want to see what it is!

2924
02:18:07.570 --> 02:18:11.930
MARISHA: Okay, as you rush past and head up in the tree--

2925
02:18:11.930 --> 02:18:14.440
TRAVIS: That's one way to peek.

2926
02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.454
MATT: You do come face to face with one of these creatures.

2927
02:18:17.454 --> 02:18:19.395
MARISHA: Hey, oh. What is it?

2928
02:18:19.395 --> 02:18:21.740
What was it?
SAM: Looks like an albino crab.

2929
02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:24.200
MARISHA: Oh, it's straight up like a silverfish.

2930
02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.040
Yeah, okay.
LAURA: Don't fight it.

2931
02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:27.585
MATT: You see, you run up the tree

2932
02:18:27.585 --> 02:18:28.418
(impacts) up into the bough

2933
02:18:28.418 --> 02:18:31.040
and it's right there. (insect chitter)

2934
02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.910
MARISHA: Uh, I found it!
MATT: Mmkay.

2935
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:37.080
MARISHA: I grab it and I'm just going to spike it

2936
02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:38.910
to the floor, right to the group.

2937
02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:40.990
MATT: Okay, so you're going to go ahead and we'll say it's

2938
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:43.300
a shove attack, so go ahead and make an attack roll.

2939
02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:45.380
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Or actually, this would be--

2940
02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:47.560
TRAVIS: You're going to throw the thing down there with us?

2941
02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:49.290
MARISHA: I want to show you guys what it is.

2942
02:18:49.290 --> 02:18:50.320
TRAVIS: Just hold it out.

2943
02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:52.180
MARISHA: I'm being very progressive right now.

2944
02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:53.470
LAURA: Are you going to spike it to where

2945
02:18:53.470 --> 02:18:54.690
you're trying to do some damage as it--

2946
02:18:54.690 --> 02:18:56.480
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Make an athletics check.

2947
02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:59.280
MARISHA: Pop. Okay.
LAURA: It's a bug.

2948
02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:02.420
Bugs are really--
MARISHA: Straight athletics?

2949
02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:04.160
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Okay.

2950
02:19:05.010 --> 02:19:05.843
14.

2951
02:19:05.843 --> 02:19:06.955
MATT: Seven.
TRAVIS: 15.

2952
02:19:06.955 --> 02:19:09.361
MARISHA: 15, 15.
MATT: You succeed.

2953
02:19:09.361 --> 02:19:10.194
As soon as it

2954
02:19:10.194 --> 02:19:13.490
pulls back, brings part of its pointed legs upward,

2955
02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:16.820
you just grab one and (yells) chuck it out of the tree.

2956
02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:20.010
MARISHA: It's gross!
MATT: It falls prone

2957
02:19:20.010 --> 02:19:22.980
on the ground right there.
LIAM: Ew!

2958
02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:25.620
MATT: It would take-- I'd say at

2959
02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:28.502
that fall there, it's about 20 or so feet--

2960
02:19:28.502 --> 02:19:31.160
seven points of bludgeoning damage.

2961
02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:32.791
MARISHA: Still alive?
SAM: Look, we're already winning.

2962
02:19:32.791 --> 02:19:33.624
MATT: Yeah.

2963
02:19:33.624 --> 02:19:34.835
It's on the ground (insect chitter)

2964
02:19:34.835 --> 02:19:36.706
about to get righted or trying to.

2965
02:19:36.706 --> 02:19:38.600
MARISHA: Can I still do stuff?
MATT: Yeah.

2966
02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:41.250
You're up in the tree still.
TRAVIS: Can I still do stuff?

2967
02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:45.410
MARISHA: Can I-- how far up am I?
LAURA: 20 feet.

2968
02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:46.960
MATT: 20 feet.
MARISHA: Can I--

2969
02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:50.630
MATT: But you moved 10 feet to get there,

2970
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:52.360
so you've used 10 feet of your movement.

2971
02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:53.790
MARISHA: Can I

2972
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:58.010
vault off the ropes-- the tree, and

2973
02:19:59.310 --> 02:20:03.680
back flip and then People's Elbow down into the silverfish?

2974
02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:05.480
MATT: I'll allow it, yeah.
LIAM: Ooh yeah.

2975
02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:07.960
MATT: So roll an acrobatics check.

2976
02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:08.793
MARISHA: Okay.

2977
02:20:08.793 --> 02:20:11.292
LIAM: (as Hulk Hogan) Lemme tell you something, brother.

2978
02:20:11.292 --> 02:20:12.961
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2979
02:20:12.961 --> 02:20:14.532
(cheering)

2980
02:20:14.532 --> 02:20:18.280
MATT: So you throw it down, you see it hit the ground,

2981
02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:20.502
you reach up and grab the branch above and

2982
02:20:20.502 --> 02:20:24.330
(wind noises) release after one full revolution in the air.

2983
02:20:24.330 --> 02:20:27.220
You guys watch, jettisoning out from the side

2984
02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:31.983
of the treeline (rushing wind) this spinning, tumbling

2985
02:20:31.983 --> 02:20:36.200
Beauregard freight train coming elbow-down.

2986
02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:38.463
So you will not take any fall damage.

2987
02:20:38.463 --> 02:20:39.491
MARISHA: Cool.
SAM: Nice.

2988
02:20:39.491 --> 02:20:40.432
MATT: It's a safe fall and everything,

2989
02:20:40.432 --> 02:20:42.410
you're pretty damn good as a monk.

2990
02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:43.900
Go ahead and roll your second attack.

2991
02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:46.429
LIAM: But Beauregardless.
MARISHA: (groans)

2992
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:47.637
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's what you get, that's what you get.

2993
02:20:47.637 --> 02:20:50.870
LAURA: Seriously?
MARISHA: I rolled a one on damage.

2994
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:54.112
Super cool when you double it to two.

2995
02:20:54.112 --> 02:20:55.720
MATT: That was your acrobatics check, was the critical.

2996
02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:57.280
You haven't rolled to hit with the second attack.

2997
02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:58.848
MARISHA: Oh, cool, cool.
LAURA: Oh good.

2998
02:20:58.848 --> 02:21:01.631
MARISHA: Cool, cool, cool, that doesn't count.

2999
02:21:01.631 --> 02:21:02.697
LIAM: Cocked.
TALIESIN: It's cocked.

3000
02:21:02.697 --> 02:21:03.779
LAURA: Yeah.

3001
02:21:03.779 --> 02:21:05.537
MATT: So roll for an attack.
MARISHA: Okay, 22.

3002
02:21:05.537 --> 02:21:08.280
MATT: And because it is prone, attack rolls

3003
02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.180
against it have advantage, so you get--

3004
02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:12.350
MARISHA: 22, 22 twice.
MATT: Yeah.

3005
02:21:12.350 --> 02:21:14.563
So you hit. Go ahead and--

3006
02:21:14.563 --> 02:21:16.813
(laughter)
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

3007
02:21:18.514 --> 02:21:21.481
MARISHA: A one on the same dice, so,

3008
02:21:22.456 --> 02:21:25.530
Don't high five that above me!

3009
02:21:25.530 --> 02:21:27.760
Like that was cool, dope bro shit.

3010
02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:30.076
Don't you like--
LIAM: The cool part

3011
02:21:30.076 --> 02:21:33.265
is that we laugh cruelly at you at the same time.

3012
02:21:33.265 --> 02:21:34.162
MATT: Friendship.

3013
02:21:34.162 --> 02:21:36.570
(laughter)

3014
02:21:36.570 --> 02:21:39.921
TRAVIS: Your pain is our enjoyment.
MATT: How much damage is done?

3015
02:21:39.921 --> 02:21:40.950
MARISHA: Seven.
LIAM: See,

3016
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:42.960
we feel better because you feel worse.

3017
02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:45.480
MARISHA: Yes, it's schadenfreude, I get it.

3018
02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:47.040
I get it.
MATT: So,

3019
02:21:47.040 --> 02:21:49.210
wham, landing and slamming your elbow into

3020
02:21:49.210 --> 02:21:51.070
the bottom of its exposed carapace underneath,

3021
02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:54.780
it (screeches) pulls back and its legs curl in.

3022
02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:56.730
You withdraw and get back to your feet.

3023
02:21:56.730 --> 02:21:58.010
You still have your bonus action.

3024
02:21:58.010 --> 02:21:59.480
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

3025
02:22:00.758 --> 02:22:02.839
Pop pop, Flurry of Blows.
MATT: Go for it.

3026
02:22:02.839 --> 02:22:03.700
LIAM: (sighs)

3027
02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:05.140
MARISHA: (laughs)

3028
02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:10.140
Okay, first one is 26, second one is 12.

3029
02:22:10.210 --> 02:22:11.750
MATT: 12 misses.
MARISHA: Okay.

3030
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:13.716
TALIESIN: Good to know.

3031
02:22:13.716 --> 02:22:15.430
MARISHA: (laughs) Nine damage.

3032
02:22:15.430 --> 02:22:16.470
MATT: Nine damage, all righty.

3033
02:22:16.470 --> 02:22:19.560
So after you give him the elbow, you bring your leg up

3034
02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:21.930
and do an ax kick down onto it, crack.

3035
02:22:21.930 --> 02:22:24.010
It hits him, (insect shrieks)

3036
02:22:24.010 --> 02:22:25.800
sits there shrieking in its space.

3037
02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:28.610
You pull your leg up and it pulls away

3038
02:22:28.610 --> 02:22:31.010
and your second impact ends up hitting the dirt below it,

3039
02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:33.523
the soft impact against the rotted floor.

3040
02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:38.770
You do, however, as part of the Extract Aspects,

3041
02:22:38.770 --> 02:22:41.640
you got a quick glance as, after the second impact,

3042
02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:43.830
your ki went into it and you're

3043
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:46.110
able to read its body essence.

3044
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:48.300
It is resistant to acid and necrotic damage

3045
02:22:49.667 --> 02:22:52.722
and it is immune to being frightened or charmed.

3046
02:22:52.722 --> 02:22:55.363
SAM: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3047
02:22:55.363 --> 02:22:58.420
MARISHA: Okay, I communicate that.
MATT: All right.

3048
02:22:58.420 --> 02:22:59.380
Beau, that finishes your turn.

3049
02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:01.895
Fjord, you're up.
TRAVIS: It's still prone, correct?

3050
02:23:01.895 --> 02:23:02.760
(laughter)

3051
02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:05.670
The white scorpion is--
MATT: It's still prone.

3052
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:06.503
TRAVIS: It's still prone.

3053
02:23:06.503 --> 02:23:09.590
I will take two swings at it with the Star Razor.

3054
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:11.660
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: With advantage, yes?

3055
02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:14.160
MATT: Yep. Are you moving over to this space here

3056
02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:15.670
or are you moving through to this side?

3057
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:16.900
TRAVIS: I'll go over to that other side.

3058
02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:18.680
MATT: All right, over here?
TRAVIS: No, I'm sorry,

3059
02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:20.182
where you were before.
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

3060
02:23:20.182 --> 02:23:21.223
TALIESIN: I like the foliage is so thick

3061
02:23:21.223 --> 02:23:22.850
that it's genuinely hard to see anything.

3062
02:23:22.850 --> 02:23:23.850
In a good way.

3063
02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:25.884
MATT: Yeah, make you work for it, yeah?

3064
02:23:25.884 --> 02:23:28.604
TRAVIS: First one is a 26.

3065
02:23:28.604 --> 02:23:29.904
MATT: This is with an advantage, too, cause it's prone.

3066
02:23:29.904 --> 02:23:30.737
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Yeah.

3067
02:23:30.737 --> 02:23:31.900
So it hits.
TRAVIS: 26.

3068
02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:35.140
And the second one is a 24.

3069
02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:37.086
MATT: Both hit.
TRAVIS: Great.

3070
02:23:37.086 --> 02:23:38.986
So we're rolling one d10.

3071
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:46.150
That's-- yeah, okay, that's 16 points of slashing damage

3072
02:23:48.410 --> 02:23:51.590
and (stutters)

3073
02:23:53.130 --> 02:23:54.330
15 points.
MATT: All right.

3074
02:23:54.330 --> 02:23:57.470
TRAVIS: So 31 total.
MATT: So you rush past,

3075
02:23:57.470 --> 02:23:59.490
striking once with a blade.

3076
02:23:59.490 --> 02:24:01.660
As it swings through, you can see it cuts open

3077
02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:04.410
its outer shell, exposing a deeper

3078
02:24:04.410 --> 02:24:07.060
purplish-type musculature underneath the armor.

3079
02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:08.250
You bring the blade down and,

3080
02:24:08.250 --> 02:24:09.760
thrusting it down into the weak space

3081
02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:10.908
and turn the blade and as it does,

3082
02:24:10.908 --> 02:24:15.300
(shrieks) the arms all curl in and it is dead.

3083
02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:16.133
LAURA: Nice.
MARISHA: Yes!

3084
02:24:16.133 --> 02:24:18.580
TALIESIN: Well, that was easy.
SAM: Easy encounter.

3085
02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:20.200
TRAVIS: One down.
LAURA: Wonderful.

3086
02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:21.770
TALIESIN: Take a long rest.

3087
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:22.603
MATT: All right, cool guys.

3088
02:24:22.603 --> 02:24:23.436
Well, thanks--

3089
02:24:23.436 --> 02:24:24.680
LIAM: Back away.
TRAVIS: Does any liquid

3090
02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:26.770
come out of the creature of any color,

3091
02:24:26.770 --> 02:24:28.910
viscous, form, anything like that?

3092
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:32.870
MATT: A similar purplish fluid as blood as its interior.

3093
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:35.250
But you hear that sound is still sifting all through

3094
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:37.260
the jungle around you.
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool.

3095
02:24:37.260 --> 02:24:38.770
MATT: So is that your turn?
TRAVIS: Yes, that's my turn.

3096
02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:41.284
No bonus action.
MATT: Okay.

3097
02:24:41.284 --> 02:24:43.930
Now, you've seen the color of that creature,

3098
02:24:43.930 --> 02:24:48.310
that eerie, creepy pale white

3099
02:24:48.310 --> 02:24:51.180
milky texture to its body and shell.

3100
02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:53.510
You now see more of it, dots of it,

3101
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:55.930
moving through the underbrush and you hear them

3102
02:24:55.930 --> 02:24:58.121
communicating and clicking. (insect chitters)

3103
02:24:58.121 --> 02:25:00.170
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: And (rushing sound)

3104
02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:02.052
they begin to rush forward.
LAURA: Oh god.

3105
02:25:02.052 --> 02:25:03.710
(miniatures clattering against each other)

3106
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:06.105
LIAM: (skittering legs)

3107
02:25:06.105 --> 02:25:07.588
LAURA: Oh no, oh no!

3108
02:25:08.932 --> 02:25:10.501
SAM: Ugh.
LAURA: They're so close already!

3109
02:25:10.501 --> 02:25:12.700
How did they get here?

3110
02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:14.720
TALIESIN: They go on after Fjord's turn,

3111
02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:16.490
I guess?
MATT: They do.

3112
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:17.910
You guys rolled really shitty initiative

3113
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:19.250
and they rolled decently--
LAURA: Yes, we did.

3114
02:25:19.250 --> 02:25:21.684
MATT: Because they're pretty quick.
SAM: Oh man, there's so many of them.

3115
02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:24.263
LAURA: Yup.
SAM: There's--

3116
02:25:24.263 --> 02:25:25.645
MATT: All righty.

3117
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:27.901
So--
LAURA: Okay.

3118
02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:32.940
MATT: These two here are going
to use their Wax Tomb ability.

3119
02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:34.531
LAURA: Wax Tomb?

3120
02:25:34.531 --> 02:25:35.422
SAM: Tomb.

3121
02:25:35.422 --> 02:25:38.060
Oh noes!
MATT: 15 foot cone, that's--

3122
02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:40.280
LAURA: Back to back was a very bad idea.

3123
02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:43.820
MATT: Fjord, Caduceus, Beauregard, and Jester,

3124
02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.987
I need you all to make a dexterity saving throw, please.

3125
02:25:47.987 --> 02:25:50.357
LIAM: Genevieve?
LAURA: I do like Genevieve,

3126
02:25:50.357 --> 02:25:51.190
but I thought that was a good--

3127
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:52.940
TALIESIN: Saving throw extra.

3128
02:25:55.050 --> 02:25:56.330
Ooh.
ASHLEY: Shit.

3129
02:25:56.330 --> 02:25:57.163
TRAVIS: 20.

3130
02:25:58.200 --> 02:25:59.220
MATT: 20.

3131
02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:04.220
You take seven points of acid damage and are not restrained.

3132
02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:07.230
Beauregard.
MARISHA: 12.

3133
02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:08.640
MATT: 12.

3134
02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:12.780
You take 14 points of acid damage and you <i>are</i> restrained.

3135
02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:15.320
You can see as they vomit outward

3136
02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:19.420
this thick, steaming viscous liquid

3137
02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:23.785
as it splatters, it hardens into a wax-like shell.

3138
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:26.760
You are currently, like, stapled

3139
02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:28.120
to the log behind you and the ground

3140
02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:29.420
and your legs are stuck to the ground

3141
02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:31.140
and you're having to try and pull

3142
02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:32.960
and break out of it as its hardening around you,

3143
02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:36.000
burning you and holding you in place.

3144
02:26:37.050 --> 02:26:39.230
Jester?
LAURA: Dexterity?

3145
02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:40.530
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: 10.

3146
02:26:40.530 --> 02:26:43.190
MATT: 10, you also take 17 points of acid damage

3147
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:45.370
and you are also restrained,

3148
02:26:45.370 --> 02:26:47.540
held in place by a waxy substance.

3149
02:26:48.810 --> 02:26:50.240
Caduceus?
TALIESIN: 16.

3150
02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:53.040
MATT: 16, you take seven points and you are not restrained.

3151
02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:55.673
TALIESIN: Seven points of acid damage.

3152
02:26:58.015 --> 02:26:59.429
LAURA: (quietly) Ow ow ow ow.

3153
02:26:59.429 --> 02:27:01.774
MATT: This guy here is going to spray this way.

3154
02:27:01.774 --> 02:27:04.382
SAM: Oh boy, they've all got it.
TALIESIN: Dammit.

3155
02:27:05.649 --> 02:27:09.635
MATT: I need Yasha, Caleb, Caduceus, Fjord, and Jester

3156
02:27:09.635 --> 02:27:11.685
to all roll another dexterity saving throw.

3157
02:27:11.685 --> 02:27:14.694
SAM: There's a lot of these guys.
LIAM: Natural 20!

3158
02:27:14.694 --> 02:27:15.660
TALIESIN: Another dex save?

3159
02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:18.109
MATT: You have disadvantage, Jester, so.

3160
02:27:18.109 --> 02:27:20.927
TALIESIN: I don't suppose I get to knock one of these, okay.

3161
02:27:20.927 --> 02:27:23.411
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16, that is...

3162
02:27:24.694 --> 02:27:26.175
yeah, another seven points of acid damage

3163
02:27:26.175 --> 02:27:27.720
and you are not restrained.

3164
02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:28.995
LIAM: Natural 20.
MATT: Natural 20.

3165
02:27:28.995 --> 02:27:30.476
Seven points, not restrained.

3166
02:27:30.476 --> 02:27:31.942
LAURA: 15.
MATT: 15?

3167
02:27:31.942 --> 02:27:34.640
Seven points, you are still restrained.

3168
02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:36.353
TALIESIN: Natural 20, 21.
MATT: All right,

3169
02:27:36.353 --> 02:27:38.130
seven points of acid damage.
ASHLEY: 22.

3170
02:27:38.130 --> 02:27:39.940
MATT: Seven points of acid damage.

3171
02:27:39.940 --> 02:27:40.773
Nice.

3172
02:27:41.853 --> 02:27:44.303
SAM: I think there's three more of them.

3173
02:27:44.303 --> 02:27:47.451
LAURA: I cannot believe we did this to ourselves right now.

3174
02:27:47.451 --> 02:27:50.846
MATT: These two are pincer attacking on Caleb.

3175
02:27:50.846 --> 02:27:53.598
LIAM: Oh good.
MATT: And with Pack Tactics,

3176
02:27:53.598 --> 02:27:56.104
they have advantage on their attacks.

3177
02:27:56.104 --> 02:27:58.047
A bite and a claw attack against you, Caleb.

3178
02:27:58.047 --> 02:28:00.670
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: Oof, that is a

3179
02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:03.772
14.
LIAM: Does not hit.

3180
02:28:03.772 --> 02:28:05.663
MATT: And that is a

3181
02:28:05.663 --> 02:28:07.610
21.
LIAM: Hits.

3182
02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:10.241
MATT: All right. It tries, you watch that, where you didn't

3183
02:28:10.241 --> 02:28:13.608
see the face before, it was this solid shell,

3184
02:28:13.608 --> 02:28:18.040
underneath, these two jaw-like pincers, rear up

3185
02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:20.350
and it folds open underneath revealing

3186
02:28:20.350 --> 02:28:23.992
a bladed jaw that's normally hidden and folded inward.

3187
02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:26.469
It tries to bite towards you

3188
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:28.323
and you hold it back with your foot.

3189
02:28:28.323 --> 02:28:31.720
As you kick it away, one of its slicing claws

3190
02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:34.763
scrapes the back of your leg and you take...

3191
02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:39.152
14 points of slashing damage.
LIAM: Ooh!

3192
02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.113
MATT: The other one, now,

3193
02:28:41.113 --> 02:28:44.004
as you back up, there's one right behind you.

3194
02:28:44.004 --> 02:28:46.768
That's going to be a 25 to hit.
LIAM: That hits.

3195
02:28:46.768 --> 02:28:49.230
MATT: And a 18 to hit.
LIAM: Ah, Shield.

3196
02:28:49.230 --> 02:28:51.556
MATT: All right. The Shield goes up.

3197
02:28:51.556 --> 02:28:53.464
It attempts to bite towards you

3198
02:28:53.464 --> 02:28:56.030
and the secondary one, its jaws open,

3199
02:28:57.371 --> 02:29:01.724
okay, and that is seven points of piercing damage

3200
02:29:01.724 --> 02:29:04.335
plus eight points of acid damage.

3201
02:29:04.335 --> 02:29:05.779
TRAVIS: Whoa.
LIAM: Mm.

3202
02:29:05.779 --> 02:29:08.993
MATT: As its jaws sink into the side of your elbow and arm

3203
02:29:08.993 --> 02:29:10.743
and you have to rip your arm away from it

3204
02:29:10.743 --> 02:29:14.654
as it begins to dissolve and eat the inside of your arm.

3205
02:29:14.654 --> 02:29:16.176
It attempts, now, to claw at you

3206
02:29:16.176 --> 02:29:18.747
and you put the Shield up. (boof) Ends up knocking it back

3207
02:29:18.747 --> 02:29:20.556
with a flash of arcane resistance as you

3208
02:29:20.556 --> 02:29:22.998
(inhales) pull back, clutching your elbow.

3209
02:29:22.998 --> 02:29:24.594
The last one's going to be attacking you, Beauregard.

3210
02:29:24.594 --> 02:29:26.553
It has advantage because you are restrained.

3211
02:29:28.968 --> 02:29:31.955
That is going to be a 14 to hit.

3212
02:29:31.955 --> 02:29:33.816
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: And a 20 to hit.

3213
02:29:33.816 --> 02:29:35.440
MARISHA: Hits.
MATT: All right.

3214
02:29:36.609 --> 02:29:38.550
Its claws come at you

3215
02:29:39.821 --> 02:29:43.970
for 14 points of slashing damage.

3216
02:29:43.970 --> 02:29:45.966
You're trying to pull
away and it bites at you.

3217
02:29:45.966 --> 02:29:48.580
You manage to push it
just back with one free arm,

3218
02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:50.713
but it manages to scrape across your forearm

3219
02:29:50.713 --> 02:29:52.944
with both of its front blades, blood now

3220
02:29:52.944 --> 02:29:53.908
pouring out of your forearm as you

3221
02:29:53.908 --> 02:29:55.864
withdraw yourself, trying to break free.

3222
02:29:55.864 --> 02:29:57.439
That finishes their turn.

3223
02:29:57.439 --> 02:29:59.681
Yasha, you're up. Nott, you're on deck.

3224
02:29:59.681 --> 02:30:03.225
ASHLEY: Okay, so the one nearest to me,

3225
02:30:03.225 --> 02:30:06.576
I would like to take the Skingorger and try to

3226
02:30:06.576 --> 02:30:08.591
pierce it through so it's stuck to the ground.

3227
02:30:08.591 --> 02:30:11.170
MATT: Go for it.
TALIESIN: This is full rage, or--

3228
02:30:11.170 --> 02:30:13.806
ASHLEY: Oh--I would like to rage.

3229
02:30:13.806 --> 02:30:15.091
Sorry.

3230
02:30:15.091 --> 02:30:16.416
Okay.
TALIESIN: Sorry.

3231
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:19.663
ASHLEY: Hey no, don't you be sorry.

3232
02:30:20.916 --> 02:30:22.218
Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3233
02:30:22.218 --> 02:30:23.501
ASHLEY: Okay.

3234
02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:27.465
19 plus nine, 28.

3235
02:30:27.465 --> 02:30:29.994
MATT: 28 hits.
ASHLEY: Okay.

3236
02:30:29.994 --> 02:30:31.352
First attack.

3237
02:30:33.738 --> 02:30:35.491
LAURA: If you're restrained, can you attack?

3238
02:30:35.491 --> 02:30:37.382
MATT: You can attack, you just have
disadvantage on your attacks.

3239
02:30:37.382 --> 02:30:38.572
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: But your speed is zero.

3240
02:30:38.572 --> 02:30:40.589
You cannot move.

3241
02:30:40.589 --> 02:30:43.945
Attacks against you have advantage.

3242
02:30:43.945 --> 02:30:46.903
ASHLEY: 22 for the first hit.
MATT: Ooh, nice.

3243
02:30:48.821 --> 02:30:51.230
ASHLEY: Second attack.
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

3244
02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:52.241
ASHLEY: Okay.

3245
02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:55.633
24?
MATT: Hits.

3246
02:30:55.633 --> 02:30:56.466
ASHLEY: Okay.

3247
02:30:56.466 --> 02:30:57.873
LAURA: (whispering) Fjord.

3248
02:30:57.873 --> 02:30:58.706
(whispering) Fjord.

3249
02:30:59.889 --> 02:31:01.672
(whispering) Do you want to get out of here?

3250
02:31:03.525 --> 02:31:04.358
TRAVIS: Yes.

3251
02:31:04.358 --> 02:31:06.850
ASHLEY: 15 points of damage.
MATT: 15 points of damage.

3252
02:31:06.850 --> 02:31:10.509
This one, after it sprayed this thick, sticky fluid

3253
02:31:10.509 --> 02:31:12.949
onto your friends that set them on the ground,

3254
02:31:12.949 --> 02:31:15.710
the steam rising up as it burns and hardens,

3255
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:18.162
you come back and swipe once with the Skingorger,

3256
02:31:18.162 --> 02:31:19.528
cutting into its body, and the second time,

3257
02:31:19.528 --> 02:31:21.582
you split it in half (squelching)--
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3258
02:31:21.582 --> 02:31:23.240
MATT: And then both sides crawl for a second

3259
02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:25.398
before going still.
LAURA: Ew.

3260
02:31:25.398 --> 02:31:28.240
TRAVIS: (grossed out) Huh huh huh.
ASHLEY: Oh, I hate these things.

3261
02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:29.965
MATT: You still have your movement, if you want.

3262
02:31:30.867 --> 02:31:32.812
And you are not currently engaged with any of them.

3263
02:31:32.812 --> 02:31:33.835
You killed the one that was next to you.

3264
02:31:33.835 --> 02:31:36.900
TRAVIS: There's no way the blood acts as a--

3265
02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:39.970
ASHLEY: Okay, I will move a little bit

3266
02:31:39.970 --> 02:31:42.898
to the other side of the one--

3267
02:31:42.898 --> 02:31:45.569
the one closest to me, sorry.

3268
02:31:45.569 --> 02:31:47.362
MATT: So over here?
ASHLEY: Yes, yeah.

3269
02:31:47.362 --> 02:31:49.078
MATT: All righty. So you go ahead
and move to flank--

3270
02:31:49.078 --> 02:31:51.627
ASHLEY: Maybe not right by the stinger, but--

3271
02:31:51.627 --> 02:31:52.713
MATT: Right there?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3272
02:31:52.713 --> 02:31:55.097
MATT: Okay, you got it.
TALIESIN: Still flanking, though.

3273
02:31:55.097 --> 02:31:56.585
MATT: Yep, still flanking with Fjord.

3274
02:31:56.585 --> 02:31:59.802
Finishes Yasha's go. Nott, you're up.
Caleb, you're on deck.

3275
02:31:59.802 --> 02:32:02.891
SAM: From the cover of the underbrush,

3276
02:32:02.891 --> 02:32:06.906
I will fire a crossbow bolt
at the one next to Caleb.

3277
02:32:06.906 --> 02:32:08.789
MATT: Before that happens--
SAM: (screams)

3278
02:32:08.789 --> 02:32:11.539
MATT: You're sitting there hiding
right next to these mushrooms

3279
02:32:11.539 --> 02:32:13.330
and as you're getting your bolt ready--
(crossbow loading)

3280
02:32:13.330 --> 02:32:14.563
the one next to you

3281
02:32:16.155 --> 02:32:18.546
releases a cloud of spores.

3282
02:32:18.546 --> 02:32:20.828
Make a constitution saving throw
at the start before your turn.

3283
02:32:20.828 --> 02:32:22.827
LAURA: Don't go near them.
Oh no, Beau, you're by one too.

3284
02:32:22.827 --> 02:32:25.372
SAM: Six.
MATT: Six? You are poisoned.

3285
02:32:25.372 --> 02:32:26.280
You can make your attack.

3286
02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:30.322
You are hidden, but you are poisoned, which makes it

3287
02:32:30.322 --> 02:32:32.147
a single roll and it does not have advantage.

3288
02:32:32.147 --> 02:32:34.567
But what are you attacking?

3289
02:32:34.567 --> 02:32:36.769
SAM: I'm attacking the one next to Caleb,

3290
02:32:36.769 --> 02:32:39.505
but if I'm rolling at disadvantage,

3291
02:32:39.505 --> 02:32:41.232
it is not a sneak attack.

3292
02:32:41.232 --> 02:32:43.443
MATT: Well, it's advantage because
it doesn't know it's there--

3293
02:32:43.443 --> 02:32:45.196
it doesn't know you're there
because you were hidden.

3294
02:32:45.196 --> 02:32:46.687
So it's just a straight roll.

3295
02:32:46.687 --> 02:32:49.630
Even so, because it's adjacent
to one of your allies

3296
02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:51.237
it still would be sneak attack damage.

3297
02:32:51.237 --> 02:32:54.517
SAM: Do I get a just poisoned
condition or do I take damage?

3298
02:32:54.517 --> 02:32:56.201
MATT: No damage, just poisoned condition

3299
02:32:56.201 --> 02:32:57.938
which means your attacks and--

3300
02:32:57.938 --> 02:33:00.830
SAM: All right, 25 to hit.
MATT: That hits, yeah.

3301
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:02.730
So roll sneak attack.

3302
02:33:02.730 --> 02:33:05.636
SAM: Not great, not great.
LAURA: Yeah.

3303
02:33:05.636 --> 02:33:07.209
12,

3304
02:33:07.209 --> 02:33:08.194
17,

3305
02:33:08.194 --> 02:33:09.902
22 plus...

3306
02:33:12.015 --> 02:33:13.615
Six is 28.

3307
02:33:13.615 --> 02:33:15.110
MATT: 28 points of damage.

3308
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:17.910
SAM: I don't think I get Fury of
the Small because they are small.

3309
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:19.564
MATT: They are considered medium creatures.

3310
02:33:19.564 --> 02:33:20.920
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Sweet.

3311
02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:22.278
SAM: So I could.

3312
02:33:24.459 --> 02:33:26.343
Hmm.

3313
02:33:26.343 --> 02:33:27.974
Nah.
MATT: Okay.

3314
02:33:27.974 --> 02:33:30.115
As you cough for a second and release the bolt

3315
02:33:30.115 --> 02:33:32.306
from your crossbow, it sticks
in the back of the creature,

3316
02:33:32.306 --> 02:33:35.014
it curls onto its side
and then jumps back in place,

3317
02:33:35.014 --> 02:33:36.287
skittering to see where it came from.

3318
02:33:36.287 --> 02:33:37.869
It doesn't quite seem to notice

3319
02:33:37.869 --> 02:33:39.695
where you are, but it's still alive.

3320
02:33:39.695 --> 02:33:40.888
You have your bonus action still.

3321
02:33:40.888 --> 02:33:42.620
SAM: I will fire again at it.
MATT: Go for it.

3322
02:33:42.620 --> 02:33:44.331
SAM: (weak coughing)

3323
02:33:44.331 --> 02:33:47.072
And now, this is at disadvantage.

3324
02:33:47.072 --> 02:33:49.668
MATT: Correct, because you are no longer hidden.

3325
02:33:49.668 --> 02:33:51.646
SAM: Okay, still 24.
MATT: Still hits.

3326
02:33:51.646 --> 02:33:53.375
TALIESIN: Wow.
SAM: Okay.

3327
02:33:53.375 --> 02:33:56.096
And another 11 points of damage.

3328
02:33:56.096 --> 02:33:57.863
MATT: 11 points of damage.

3329
02:33:57.863 --> 02:34:01.154
You sink this one into
where its head would be,

3330
02:34:01.154 --> 02:34:03.044
though its jaws are no longer exposed,

3331
02:34:03.044 --> 02:34:04.994
and as it sinks in, it just--
(splatting)

3332
02:34:04.994 --> 02:34:06.902
onto the ground, no longer moving.

3333
02:34:06.902 --> 02:34:10.690
SAM: I will leave that cover place.

3334
02:34:10.690 --> 02:34:12.754
I don't want to be-- more poisoned?

3335
02:34:12.754 --> 02:34:14.906
Can you be more poisoned?
MATT: Only one way to find out.

3336
02:34:14.906 --> 02:34:16.900
SAM: I will leave.
MATT: Where you going?

3337
02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:20.220
SAM: Run over near-- behind Yasha.

3338
02:34:20.220 --> 02:34:23.496
MATT: Okay, move over in that space there.

3339
02:34:23.496 --> 02:34:24.713
All righty, you got it.

3340
02:34:24.713 --> 02:34:26.116
That finishes your turn?
SAM: Yeah.

3341
02:34:26.116 --> 02:34:27.471
MATT: Caleb, you're up.
Jester, you're on deck.

3342
02:34:27.471 --> 02:34:28.480
LAURA: Okay.

3343
02:34:30.038 --> 02:34:31.417
LIAM: Okay.

3344
02:34:31.417 --> 02:34:33.497
I stumble back, totally wrecked,

3345
02:34:33.497 --> 02:34:34.977
from the thing that attacked me,

3346
02:34:34.977 --> 02:34:37.315
pulling implements out of my bag

3347
02:34:37.315 --> 02:34:39.512
and iron dust goes through the air

3348
02:34:39.512 --> 02:34:42.390
and I pull my hands apart and
Beauregard doubles in size,

3349
02:34:42.390 --> 02:34:44.600
hopefully breaking out
of whatever she is in.

3350
02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:47.600
MATT: I will say that that--
LIAM: She doubles in size.

3351
02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:48.920
MATT: Because it makes sense, yeah.

3352
02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:50.096
Thematically? Yeah.

3353
02:34:50.096 --> 02:34:51.395
MARISHA: (victorious humming)

3354
02:34:51.395 --> 02:34:56.368
MATT: So you, (thudding) pushing back
the rotted log behind you,

3355
02:34:56.368 --> 02:34:58.367
it rolls--

3356
02:34:58.367 --> 02:35:01.575
exposing a bunch of the earth beneath it

3357
02:35:01.575 --> 02:35:04.183
and you see dozens of insects scatter

3358
02:35:04.183 --> 02:35:06.649
from underneath the wet, exposed earth

3359
02:35:06.649 --> 02:35:08.552
that was beneath the log.

3360
02:35:08.552 --> 02:35:10.070
And there you are.
LIAM: I am going to

3361
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:12.490
chance a hit and try to
get away from the thing

3362
02:35:12.490 --> 02:35:14.730
and go up by those mushrooms--

3363
02:35:14.730 --> 02:35:15.990
MATT: Here?
LIAM: Up there, yeah.

3364
02:35:16.843 --> 02:35:19.650
MATT: All right, so five, 10, 15, 20, over here?

3365
02:35:19.650 --> 02:35:21.808
LIAM: Yeah, that's good.
MATT: All righty.

3366
02:35:22.990 --> 02:35:24.470
It's going to go ahead and take a swipe at you,

3367
02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:27.060
we'll say with its bite, yes.

3368
02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:27.930
Is this 'til the end of your next turn

3369
02:35:27.930 --> 02:35:28.850
or the beginning of your next turn?

3370
02:35:28.850 --> 02:35:30.200
LIAM: Oh jeez.
MATT: Double check that.

3371
02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:32.550
MATT: You have never asked me that question before.

3372
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:36.250
Until the start of your next turn.

3373
02:35:36.250 --> 02:35:39.110
MATT: So you no longer have Shield.

3374
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.943
LIAM: Oh, okay.

3375
02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:44.040
MATT: That is going to be a 21 to hit.

3376
02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:44.990
LIAM: That hits.

3377
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:46.340
<i>Scheiße.</i>
MATT: All right.

3378
02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:50.250
So you take 13 points of piercing damage.

3379
02:35:50.250 --> 02:35:51.750
LIAM: Ugh.
MTT: And five points

3380
02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:53.110
of acid damage.
LIAM: Okay.

3381
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:54.930
MATT: As it bites out of you, its head

3382
02:35:54.930 --> 02:35:56.720
opening once more into the split jaw

3383
02:35:56.720 --> 02:35:58.620
and the bladed tusks that come forward

3384
02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:01.080
and sinks into the side of your leg

3385
02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:02.550
as you try and pull away and you

3386
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:04.870
stumble in the direction, getting off to

3387
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:07.320
the side of the mushrooms, holding back the pain.

3388
02:36:08.449 --> 02:36:09.498
LIAM: Caleb's a bloody mess.

3389
02:36:09.498 --> 02:36:10.598
MATT: All right, that's the end of Caleb's turn.

3390
02:36:10.598 --> 02:36:12.720
Jester, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

3391
02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:13.820
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Am I still restrained,

3392
02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:15.220
by the way?
MATT: You're still restrained.

3393
02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:17.650
Oh you, no you never became restrained, I don't think.

3394
02:36:17.650 --> 02:36:19.760
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: No. No, I didn't.

3395
02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:21.510
MATT: No, you made the saves both times.
TALIESIN: Heh heh-heh.

3396
02:36:22.907 --> 02:36:23.740
LAURA: Okay.

3397
02:36:25.605 --> 02:36:28.264
I'm going to cast,

3398
02:36:30.750 --> 02:36:35.337
I'm going to cast Spiritual Guardians.

3399
02:36:36.187 --> 02:36:37.430
(laughter)

3400
02:36:37.430 --> 02:36:40.210
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: So certain.

3401
02:36:40.210 --> 02:36:41.870
LAURA: I'm going to hold up my hand with

3402
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:44.240
the Traveler symbol on the wrist and I'm going to be like:

3403
02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:48.620
Okay, well, let's do this.

3404
02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:51.090
MATT: All righty, that puts it about there.

3405
02:36:51.090 --> 02:36:52.510
There's Beau.

3406
02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:55.012
Okay, Spiritual Guardians--
LAURA: So I'm casting that at fourth level.

3407
02:36:55.012 --> 02:36:56.780
MATT: At fourth level.

3408
02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:59.470
Suddenly, this darkened edge of the forest

3409
02:36:59.470 --> 02:37:02.400
is alight with what I assume to be dozens of

3410
02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:05.340
extremely swole tiny, angry, pink--

3411
02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:06.798
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Unicorns or hamsters,

3412
02:37:06.798 --> 02:37:07.940
which are you doing this time?

3413
02:37:07.940 --> 02:37:10.850
LAURA: Oh, the hamster unicorns.
SAM: Sure, sure.

3414
02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:13.113
MATT: All right.

3415
02:37:13.113 --> 02:37:14.750
They are now just zipping through

3416
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:17.050
and coming to pierce any creatures that comes near.

3417
02:37:17.050 --> 02:37:19.506
That's your action. Are you staying put?

3418
02:37:19.506 --> 02:37:21.820
LAURA: Well, I can, can I try to--
MATT: Oh no, you're restrained.

3419
02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:24.010
LAURA: Yeah, can I try to--
MATT: It's an action to

3420
02:37:24.010 --> 02:37:25.930
try and break free. It's an action to cast.

3421
02:37:25.930 --> 02:37:27.396
So you are remaining.

3422
02:37:27.396 --> 02:37:29.087
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool, cool.

3423
02:37:29.087 --> 02:37:30.910
MATT: Is that your turn?
LAURA: I mean, I guess so.

3424
02:37:30.910 --> 02:37:33.220
MATT: All right, Caduceus, you're up.
Beauregard, you're on deck.

3425
02:37:33.220 --> 02:37:35.237
TALIESIN: I'm going to do an old favorite.

3426
02:37:35.237 --> 02:37:39.250
Am I-- can I touch Beauregard without

3427
02:37:39.250 --> 02:37:42.700
triggering an attack from any of these creatures?

3428
02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:44.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're right next to her,

3429
02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:46.250
she's just much bigger right now.

3430
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:47.500
TALIESIN: This is going to be funny.

3431
02:37:48.530 --> 02:37:51.700
Holy Weapon.
MARISHA: Ah!

3432
02:37:51.700 --> 02:37:53.575
I hope I don't fuck this up.

3433
02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:56.400
TALIESIN: I was trying to think of something

3434
02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.250
I haven't done in awhile.

3435
02:37:57.250 --> 02:37:58.250
I haven't done that in awhile.

3436
02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:59.960
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

3437
02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:01.620
Caduceus is concentration.

3438
02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:04.580
TRAVIS: What's she getting?
MATT: Jester is concentration.

3439
02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:07.120
TALIESIN: You get an extra 2d8, actually,

3440
02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:09.310
that's a bonus action, too, which is kind of crazy.

3441
02:38:09.310 --> 02:38:12.290
MATT: I'll put this on Beauregard

3442
02:38:12.290 --> 02:38:13.380
as a reminder of the Holy Weapon.

3443
02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:15.167
LAURA: You just can't do any other spells.

3444
02:38:15.167 --> 02:38:17.820
TALIESIN: Yeah, I still haven't, I can do a cantrip

3445
02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:21.303
or a, so I'm going to use my cantrip

3446
02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:25.980
to do, I can Sacred Flame still since that's an action,

3447
02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:28.740
that was a bonus action, that's a cantrip, so.

3448
02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.490
That's a cantrip and a spell or no?

3449
02:38:31.490 --> 02:38:32.930
MATT: A spell and a cantrip you can do.

3450
02:38:32.930 --> 02:38:34.100
Sacred Flame is an action, though,

3451
02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:35.859
not a bonus action?
TALIESIN: It's a bonus action.

3452
02:38:35.859 --> 02:38:38.630
Oh no, not, Sacred Flame is an action.

3453
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:39.463
MATT: Correct.

3454
02:38:39.463 --> 02:38:41.060
TALIESIN: But Holy Weapon's a bonus action.

3455
02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:43.590
MATT: Oh, that, then you can definitely do that, hell yeah.

3456
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:45.650
What are you Sacred Flame-ing?

3457
02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:49.640
TALIESIN: Well, is anything-- who's threatening Caleb?

3458
02:38:50.539 --> 02:38:52.147
MATT: Right now, Caleb ran off to the side.

3459
02:38:52.147 --> 02:38:54.500
He's hurt, but he's run off.
LIAM: Pretty hurt.

3460
02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:57.220
TALIESIN: I'll do the one that's in front of me

3461
02:38:57.220 --> 02:38:58.940
that's not going to get attacked by Yasha

3462
02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:00.260
and the, yeah, I'm going to do the one

3463
02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:02.210
that's behind me.
MATT: Right there?

3464
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:03.043
You got it.
TALIESIN: I'm just going to give it

3465
02:39:03.043 --> 02:39:04.840
a little Sacred Flame.
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

3466
02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:07.050
Oh man, that rolled shitty.

3467
02:39:07.050 --> 02:39:08.380
That's an eight.

3468
02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:09.540
TALIESIN: Oh, so you take--

3469
02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:12.950
oh shit, I do a lot of damage on this thing.

3470
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:14.080
Is that right?

3471
02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:15.350
Man, it's been awhile.

3472
02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:18.440
3d8, apparently.
LAURA: Cantrips.

3473
02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:20.130
TALIESIN: Ugh.
LAURA: Oh, balls.

3474
02:39:20.130 --> 02:39:22.185
TALIESIN: That's terrible, 14 points of radiant damage.

3475
02:39:22.185 --> 02:39:23.981
MATT: 14 points of radiant damage.

3476
02:39:23.981 --> 02:39:26.670
The radiant flame burns around its body,

3477
02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:29.400
it shrinks back and you can hear the squeaking sound of

3478
02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:33.060
some of its armored shell squeezing a little bit and--

3479
02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:36.070
TALIESIN: Back off, buddy.
MATT: It's still standing there.

3480
02:39:36.070 --> 02:39:39.690
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm just going to keep where I am.

3481
02:39:39.690 --> 02:39:42.670
MATT: All right, you got it. Caduceus' turn is done.

3482
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:45.010
At the top of the round, Beau, before you go,

3483
02:39:45.010 --> 02:39:47.820
the skittering sounds continue to grow.

3484
02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:49.870
While they're not taking their turn yet--

3485
02:39:51.490 --> 02:39:53.420
SAM: Oh, man. More?
LIAM: Shit.

3486
02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:57.606
MATT: More begin to appear out of the nearby brush.

3487
02:39:57.606 --> 02:39:58.650
SAM: Oh noes.

3488
02:40:00.010 --> 02:40:00.930
Ohs noes.

3489
02:40:00.930 --> 02:40:02.550
Oh no!

3490
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:03.540
Oh no!

3491
02:40:04.490 --> 02:40:06.550
Wait, what?

3492
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:08.390
MATT: There we go.
SAM: This could be bad.

3493
02:40:08.390 --> 02:40:10.885
MATT: They haven't taken their turn yet.

3494
02:40:10.885 --> 02:40:12.620
Beau, you're up.

3495
02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:15.620
Your fists are glowing with radiant, divine,

3496
02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:18.197
Melora the Wildmother blessed energy.

3497
02:40:18.197 --> 02:40:20.597
You can feel the vibration between your fingers.

3498
02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:25.590
MARISHA: I spin my staff with a flourish

3499
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:30.025
like a holy, radiant windmill.

3500
02:40:31.270 --> 02:40:32.103
SAM: Sure.

3501
02:40:32.103 --> 02:40:33.730
MARISHA: Then I don't use my staff

3502
02:40:33.730 --> 02:40:38.260
and I start just stomping the silverfish.

3503
02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:39.093
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3504
02:40:39.093 --> 02:40:40.229
MATT: To the one right in front of you there?

3505
02:40:40.229 --> 02:40:43.060
MARISHA: Uh-huh, and then the one over there.

3506
02:40:43.060 --> 02:40:44.450
I'll do these two in front of me.

3507
02:40:44.450 --> 02:40:46.250
MATT: Okay, so focusing on the first one.

3508
02:40:46.250 --> 02:40:48.200
The first two attacks against it, or first attack.

3509
02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:52.533
What're you doing?
MARISHA: First attack on that one.

3510
02:40:53.555 --> 02:40:55.279
LAURA: Should switch your dice, man.

3511
02:40:55.279 --> 02:40:56.562
LIAM: It's a one.
MARISHA: I did, I did.

3512
02:40:56.562 --> 02:40:58.570
LIAM: It's a one.
MARISHA: I did.

3513
02:40:58.570 --> 02:41:00.561
MATT: You bring your foot up (groans)

3514
02:41:00.561 --> 02:41:02.027
and as you stomp downward,

3515
02:41:02.027 --> 02:41:03.840
immediately skitters up out of the way

3516
02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:05.500
and your foot, hits the ground,

3517
02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:09.870
sending dirt and bits of leaf and vine up in the air

3518
02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:11.450
around it and as you look down,

3519
02:41:11.450 --> 02:41:13.480
it's just beyond the reach of your foot.

3520
02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:15.800
MARISHA: Fucking dick--
MATT: Second attack.

3521
02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.177
MARISHA: Hit again.

3522
02:41:17.177 --> 02:41:19.770
16.
MATT: 16 just hits.

3523
02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:21.910
MARISHA: Okay, that's the magic number.

3524
02:41:22.890 --> 02:41:24.590
Yeah, cool.
LIAM: Plus plus plus.

3525
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:26.630
MARISHA: Plus, plus, wait, these are all these.

3526
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:27.997
Wait, these are all these.

3527
02:41:27.997 --> 02:41:29.800
TALIESIN: Is that plus your 2d8?
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3528
02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:32.410
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

3529
02:41:32.410 --> 02:41:36.760
Six plus two, six, seven, eight, plus another eight

3530
02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:40.601
is 16 plus another two is 18.

3531
02:41:40.601 --> 02:41:41.763
MATT: 18 points of damage.

3532
02:41:41.763 --> 02:41:42.748
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All righty.

3533
02:41:42.748 --> 02:41:45.270
So the second time, you do stomp down (grunts)

3534
02:41:45.270 --> 02:41:47.110
and it ends up pinning it to the ground

3535
02:41:47.110 --> 02:41:48.710
and you feel its body give a little bit

3536
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:51.940
and it cracks and its legs skitter for a bit.

3537
02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:52.773
It's hurt.

3538
02:41:53.810 --> 02:41:58.335
MARISHA: You fuck-- come on, pop pop.

3539
02:41:58.335 --> 02:42:00.092
MATT: (laughs) All right.

3540
02:42:00.092 --> 02:42:02.002
SAM: Bob bob.
LAURA: Bob bob bob.

3541
02:42:02.002 --> 02:42:04.980
MARISHA: The first one towards him, same guy.

3542
02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:06.780
MATT: Yep, you're just focusing on the one dude right now--

3543
02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:08.900
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

3544
02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:10.320
26.
MATT: That hits.

3545
02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:12.487
You can roll damage.

3546
02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:20.180
MARISHA: 16 plus another four, which is 20,

3547
02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:24.430
plus another seven, 27, plus one, 28.

3548
02:42:24.430 --> 02:42:25.430
MATT: 28 against that one.

3549
02:42:25.430 --> 02:42:27.110
All right, before I forget, because I should have

3550
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:29.310
remembered this, make a constitution saving throw for me.

3551
02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:31.730
MARISHA: Save?
MATT: Yeah.

3552
02:42:31.730 --> 02:42:33.760
SAM: Oh.
MARISHA: Okay.

3553
02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:34.880
19?
MATT: 19.

3554
02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:35.713
You're fine.

3555
02:42:35.713 --> 02:42:40.170
The mushroom next to you releases spores around

3556
02:42:40.170 --> 02:42:43.470
and your large self coughs for a second, but you're--

3557
02:42:43.470 --> 02:42:45.430
MARISHA: Resistant to poison, too.
MATT: Resistant to poison.

3558
02:42:45.430 --> 02:42:47.360
It doesn't have an affect on you.

3559
02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:48.240
SAM: Monk shit.
MATT: That's right.

3560
02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:49.440
Because no, you're immune to poison, so--

3561
02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:51.210
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm good.
MATT: You're like--

3562
02:42:51.210 --> 02:42:52.318
MATT: (coughs) Whatever, you're fine.

3563
02:42:52.318 --> 02:42:55.280
MARISHA: I'm like, "Oh, my high school days."

3564
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:57.783
MATT: Right.

3565
02:42:57.783 --> 02:42:58.830
So as you stomp down--

3566
02:42:58.830 --> 02:43:01.444
MARISHA: Thank you.
MATT: That second hit

3567
02:43:01.444 --> 02:43:04.520
actively splatters

3568
02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:06.240
that one with the final hit.

3569
02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:08.560
So you miss it once, you hit it a second time,

3570
02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:11.430
you pull up for a third hit as the second hit cracks

3571
02:43:11.430 --> 02:43:13.310
and you pull up your foot one final bit

3572
02:43:13.310 --> 02:43:15.510
and it's like (squeaks) and you just,

3573
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:18.220
(squishing) scatters and splatters

3574
02:43:18.220 --> 02:43:19.663
against the floor nearby.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3575
02:43:19.663 --> 02:43:20.663
TRAVIS: Nice.
MARISHA: One more?

3576
02:43:22.775 --> 02:43:24.269
MATT: This is the Holy Weapon stuff, right?

3577
02:43:24.269 --> 02:43:25.102
You still have one more attack.

3578
02:43:25.102 --> 02:43:25.935
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

3579
02:43:25.935 --> 02:43:26.940
There's one more left right there

3580
02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:28.481
that's adjacent to you.
MARISHA: Pop pop!

3581
02:43:29.352 --> 02:43:30.677
TRAVIS: Cocked.
SAM: Cock cock?

3582
02:43:31.592 --> 02:43:33.717
MARISHA: Fucking titties, 18.

3583
02:43:33.717 --> 02:43:34.917
MATT: 18 hits.

3584
02:43:37.722 --> 02:43:38.938
TRAVIS: Crack-a-doon.

3585
02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:44.303
MARISHA: Six plus 10,

3586
02:43:44.303 --> 02:43:47.950
plus 14, plus another for 28.

3587
02:43:47.950 --> 02:43:50.220
Or no, 18, 18, 18.

3588
02:43:51.470 --> 02:43:53.460
MATT: 18 points of damage on the second hit.

3589
02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:55.300
This one tries to skitter away and you reach down

3590
02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:57.720
and stomp onto it, pushing it into the ground.

3591
02:43:57.720 --> 02:43:59.200
Two of its legs snap off and are

3592
02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:01.150
left behind as you pull your foot back.

3593
02:44:01.150 --> 02:44:02.400
It's still holding on.

3594
02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:04.772
It's really, really hurt.
LAURA: What?

3595
02:44:04.772 --> 02:44:06.650
It's just one little bug.
LIAM: Cockroaches, man.

3596
02:44:06.650 --> 02:44:09.050
MATT: These things are pretty big.
MARISHA: All right.

3597
02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:09.910
MATT: That finishes your turn, Beau?

3598
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:11.620
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

3599
02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:14.790
TRAVIS: I will, (clears throat) (clicks tongue)

3600
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:17.920
I will send an Eldritch Blast towards the one

3601
02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:20.340
that Beau was trying to finish off.

3602
02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:22.740
MATT: Go for it. One single blast towards that.

3603
02:44:24.970 --> 02:44:26.269
TRAVIS: That is a 20 to hit.

3604
02:44:26.269 --> 02:44:27.912
MATT: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

3605
02:44:29.230 --> 02:44:33.250
TRAVIS: That is nine points of force damage.

3606
02:44:33.250 --> 02:44:34.770
MATT: Nine points of force damage.

3607
02:44:34.770 --> 02:44:37.430
As it tries to pull away and climb the tree

3608
02:44:37.430 --> 02:44:40.260
away from Beauregard, wounded, with its remaining legs,

3609
02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:41.730
as it skitters up the side, you aim

3610
02:44:41.730 --> 02:44:43.370
and throw the Eldritch Blast.

3611
02:44:43.370 --> 02:44:46.234
It slams into it and cracks it open in two sides.

3612
02:44:46.234 --> 02:44:49.212
It's like (sliding noise) slides down the tree, dead.

3613
02:44:49.212 --> 02:44:50.360
You have a second blast to throw.

3614
02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:51.202
TRAVIS: Sneak a peek.

3615
02:44:51.202 --> 02:44:52.527
I don't think I can see that one up on the ledge

3616
02:44:52.527 --> 02:44:53.680
from line of sight.
MATT: Right there?

3617
02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:55.370
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: There's one in front of you, Fjord.

3618
02:44:55.370 --> 02:44:57.638
MATT: You can see these two right here.

3619
02:44:57.638 --> 02:44:59.496
There's one under here--
TRAVIS: Oh, there's one right in front--

3620
02:44:59.496 --> 02:45:03.890
MATT: And one up top there. Yep.
TRAVIS: I can't see it.

3621
02:45:03.890 --> 02:45:06.386
Can I try and shoot the one that's right in front of me?

3622
02:45:06.386 --> 02:45:09.569
MATT: Yeah, go for it. It's right there (boof).

3623
02:45:09.569 --> 02:45:10.406
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3624
02:45:10.406 --> 02:45:12.083
ALL: Yeah!
MATT: Oh, there you go.

3625
02:45:12.083 --> 02:45:14.583
TRAVIS: Hot dog, bitches.

3626
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:19.080
Eight, (hums) 12.

3627
02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:20.320
Now, do I re-roll?

3628
02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:23.008
Do I have a savage thingy?

3629
02:45:23.008 --> 02:45:25.810
(humming)

3630
02:45:25.810 --> 02:45:27.390
Score a critical hit, one, roll one

3631
02:45:27.390 --> 02:45:29.000
additional dice an additional time.

3632
02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:30.505
So that's 12.

3633
02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:33.630
So 16 points of damage.

3634
02:45:33.630 --> 02:45:35.250
MATT: 16 points of damage to this one?

3635
02:45:35.250 --> 02:45:36.083
TRAVIS: Yep.

3636
02:45:36.083 --> 02:45:38.308
MATT: This one had,

3637
02:45:40.178 --> 02:45:41.750
was this one previously hurt, there?

3638
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:42.814
LAURA: I don't think so.

3639
02:45:42.814 --> 02:45:46.410
MATT: I don't think that one had yet. So 16 points on that.

3640
02:45:46.410 --> 02:45:49.363
All right. So as you blast that one
with the Eldritch Blast overtop,

3641
02:45:49.363 --> 02:45:51.910
it impacts, leaving this harsh burn mark

3642
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:53.650
on its top side, but it's still standing.

3643
02:45:53.650 --> 02:45:54.930
TRAVIS: Okay, that's my turn.

3644
02:45:54.930 --> 02:45:57.213
MATT: All right, now it's their turn.
LAURA: ♪ He's still standing, ♪

3645
02:45:57.213 --> 02:45:59.306
♪ and he takes 4d8 of damage. ♪

3646
02:45:59.306 --> 02:46:01.042
TALIESIN: Yeah, all the ones within the circle take damage.

3647
02:46:01.042 --> 02:46:02.682
MATT: Yeah, let me first see what they do.

3648
02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:08.365
TALIESIN: Once they're in the circle, they are half speed.

3649
02:46:08.365 --> 02:46:10.800
MATT: Right. So he would only get to there, then.

3650
02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:12.250
Bad for you, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Eh.

3651
02:46:13.785 --> 02:46:16.060
MATT: I'm just adjusting that properly.

3652
02:46:17.204 --> 02:46:19.380
TRAVIS: Hm.
MATT: There we go.

3653
02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:21.850
This one here's going to skitter up

3654
02:46:21.850 --> 02:46:24.310
into the range, this one's going to (skittering)--

3655
02:46:24.310 --> 02:46:25.143
SAM: Oh boy.

3656
02:46:25.143 --> 02:46:29.122
MATT: Move here next to Beauregard.

3657
02:46:29.122 --> 02:46:33.503
This one here is going to also focus on Beauregard.

3658
02:46:33.503 --> 02:46:35.102
LAURA: (groaning)

3659
02:46:35.102 --> 02:46:36.370
MATT: You're the big target.

3660
02:46:36.370 --> 02:46:38.260
MARISHA: Yeah, I know, it's fine.
MATT: So the one going against

3661
02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:40.010
Caleb, who Caleb doesn't see yet

3662
02:46:40.010 --> 02:46:43.563
is kind of blocking behind the mushrooms there.

3663
02:46:43.563 --> 02:46:44.782
MARISHA: Are you going to [inaudible], dude?

3664
02:46:44.782 --> 02:46:45.974
LIAM: Yep.

3665
02:46:45.974 --> 02:46:50.080
MATT: That is a 16 to hit?

3666
02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:51.670
LIAM: Shield.
MATT: All right,

3667
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:53.200
shield's up a second time.

3668
02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:56.080
And a 20 to hit.
LIAM: Hits.

3669
02:46:56.080 --> 02:46:57.230
MATT: Just hits?
LIAM: Just hits.

3670
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:59.021
MATT: Ugh. All right, so the first one,

3671
02:46:59.021 --> 02:46:59.854
as you hear it coming up

3672
02:46:59.854 --> 02:47:02.030
from behind you, you spin around and put the shield up.

3673
02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:04.180
It tries to bite towards you, it gets pushed off.

3674
02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:06.770
Spins around and then rakes across with its claws

3675
02:47:06.770 --> 02:47:08.160
and still manages to impact you.

3676
02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:12.849
You take 14 points of slashing damage.

3677
02:47:12.849 --> 02:47:14.160
LAURA: Are you still up?

3678
02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:15.420
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Oh!

3679
02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:17.860
MATT: Oh shit.

3680
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:22.400
This one here is going to--

3681
02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:24.910
TALIESIN: Take damage first, I would assume.

3682
02:47:24.910 --> 02:47:25.850
MATT: Yes, it does.

3683
02:47:25.850 --> 02:47:28.750
So the wisdom saves on this are--

3684
02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:30.270
All three of those.

3685
02:47:30.270 --> 02:47:32.230
That one does not get hit, though.

3686
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:35.440
So roll damage.

3687
02:47:37.350 --> 02:47:39.330
SAM: We bought them, but I don't
think we ever passed them out.

3688
02:47:39.330 --> 02:47:40.163
LAURA: 13.

3689
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.943
MATT: 13?

3690
02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:45.430
All righty. So for that one there.

3691
02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:49.490
16?
LAURA: Failed.

3692
02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.720
SAM: Oh, how did that get over there?

3693
02:47:52.720 --> 02:47:54.790
MATT: That one there?
SAM: Oh.

3694
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:57.280
No, you had them all and you never passed them out.

3695
02:47:57.280 --> 02:47:58.945
MATT: That one there.

3696
02:47:58.945 --> 02:48:00.875
Rolled low as well.

3697
02:48:00.875 --> 02:48:02.360
So all three of them take 13 damage.

3698
02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:04.730
They rush in and just get blasted immediately

3699
02:48:04.730 --> 02:48:06.830
and pierced by dozens of quick-moving

3700
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:09.266
unicorn hamsters going (squeaks).

3701
02:48:09.266 --> 02:48:10.274
LAURA: (high pitched whinnying)

3702
02:48:10.274 --> 02:48:12.470
MATT: Leaving these puncture marks in their outer armor.

3703
02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:14.230
LAURA: What about the one right next to us

3704
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:16.490
that started its turn in there?

3705
02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:18.130
MATT: Yeah, they all, all of them took

3706
02:48:18.130 --> 02:48:19.710
the damage, all three of these.

3707
02:48:19.710 --> 02:48:21.620
This guy did not and that guy did not.

3708
02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:22.660
LAURA: That guy's still standing?

3709
02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:24.810
Shit.
SAM: ♪ He's still standing. ♪

3710
02:48:24.810 --> 02:48:28.670
MATT: So the one that just entered this space is going to

3711
02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:33.430
go ahead and attempt to shoot out its acid fun times.

3712
02:48:34.525 --> 02:48:37.632
That's going to be-- I need Caduceus, Fjord, and Jester

3713
02:48:37.632 --> 02:48:40.730
to go ahead and make dexterity saving throws for me, please.

3714
02:48:40.730 --> 02:48:43.030
LAURA: Are we at disadvantage because we're restrained?

3715
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:44.750
TALIESIN: I'm not.
LAURA: Am I at disadvantage

3716
02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:47.917
because I'm restrained?
MATT: You are, yes.

3717
02:48:50.383 --> 02:48:52.480
TRAVIS: Four.
MATT: 17 points of acid damage

3718
02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:54.430
and you are restrained.

3719
02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:59.480
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: All righty, Jester?

3720
02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:01.800
LAURA: Seven.
MATT: 17 points of acid damage

3721
02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:05.320
and you're restrained.
SAM: Oh noes.

3722
02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:07.160
TALIESIN: 15.
MATT: 15.

3723
02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:10.070
You take eight points of acid damage

3724
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:11.760
and you are not restrained.

3725
02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:13.270
SAM: Are you double restrained right now?

3726
02:49:13.270 --> 02:49:14.920
LAURA: I think you're just restrained.

3727
02:49:16.290 --> 02:49:18.690
TALIESIN: I have to make a concentration check,

3728
02:49:18.690 --> 02:49:20.340
correct?
MATT: You do.

3729
02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:21.710
both of you do.
TALIESIN: Is it concentration?

3730
02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:24.043
Yeah.
MATT: Concentration checks.

3731
02:49:25.074 --> 02:49:26.730
LAURA: At disadvantage or just a concentration--

3732
02:49:26.730 --> 02:49:28.620
TALIESIN: Five. No wait, wait.

3733
02:49:28.620 --> 02:49:29.730
Six.

3734
02:49:29.730 --> 02:49:31.290
MATT: Six? Holy Weapon fails.

3735
02:49:31.290 --> 02:49:34.480
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.
MATT: Beauregard, your--

3736
02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:37.410
TALIESIN: That was terrible.
MATT: -- fists suddenly fade

3737
02:49:37.410 --> 02:49:40.800
from divine energy as the acid spray breaks

3738
02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:42.840
Caduceus' concentration.
MARISHA: Fucking fuck--

3739
02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:45.330
LIAM: Do I need a concentration check myself?

3740
02:49:45.330 --> 02:49:47.860
Because I got hit, too, and I've got Enlarge up on Beau.

3741
02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:50.809
MATT: That's true.
SAM: Oh no.

3742
02:49:50.809 --> 02:49:53.627
MARISHA: No, I like being big.

3743
02:49:53.627 --> 02:49:54.460
LIAM: It's all right, I'm pretty good--

3744
02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.870
SAM: ♪ I like big Beaus and I cannot lie. ♪

3745
02:49:56.870 --> 02:50:00.686
LIAM: Advantage for me. That's a 19 and one.

3746
02:50:00.686 --> 02:50:02.561
19 plus my proficiency.

3747
02:50:02.561 --> 02:50:03.940
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a big--
MATT: You're fine, you're fine.

3748
02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:05.992
MARISHA: That's good.

3749
02:50:05.992 --> 02:50:08.728
LAURA: Six.
MATT: Six?

3750
02:50:08.728 --> 02:50:12.280
And the unicorns fade as well.

3751
02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:16.220
Some bad saves there, guys, I'm sorry.

3752
02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:18.471
SAM: You're not sorry.
MATT: No, I'm not.

3753
02:50:18.471 --> 02:50:20.721
(laughter)

3754
02:50:22.358 --> 02:50:24.090
All righty.
SAM: How many more are there?

3755
02:50:24.090 --> 02:50:25.890
MATT: That fading. You now have one over here

3756
02:50:25.890 --> 02:50:27.650
that's attacking you, Jester,

3757
02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:29.420
on the opposite side, it's rushing up.

3758
02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:31.640
TRAVIS: Four, five, six.
MATT: Natural one.

3759
02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:33.830
Oh, but you're restrained so it has advantage.

3760
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:35.280
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: Ooh, that's better.

3761
02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:36.590
24 to hit.
LAURA: Yeah.

3762
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:40.000
MATT: The second hit is going to be

3763
02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.580
20 to hit.
LAURA: Yep.

3764
02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:44.570
MATT: All right, so first it bites out towards you,

3765
02:50:44.570 --> 02:50:48.070
grasping onto your body with its jaws and bites down.

3766
02:50:48.070 --> 02:50:51.950
You take 12 points of piercing damage

3767
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:53.330
and eight points of acid damage,

3768
02:50:53.330 --> 02:50:55.510
so a total of 20 points of damage.

3769
02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:59.010
Its claws then swing out towards you and,

3770
02:50:59.010 --> 02:51:01.590
oh, double ones, seven points of slashing damage.

3771
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:04.510
As it's bitten on to you, it begins grinding towards you

3772
02:51:04.510 --> 02:51:07.370
but your shield's up in front and you push it off.

3773
02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:10.010
The one on the other side is going to attack you, Fjord.

3774
02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:11.050
You are restrained so it also has

3775
02:51:11.050 --> 02:51:13.700
advantage on its attack rolls.

3776
02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:17.240
The bite towards you is going
to be, that's not great either,

3777
02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:19.110
14 to hit?
TRAVIS: That does not hit.

3778
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:20.830
MATT: You manage to push it away with your shield.

3779
02:51:20.830 --> 02:51:25.070
It's going to attempt to go at
you with its claws for 14 again.

3780
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:26.270
TRAVIS: Misses.
MATT: With advantage.

3781
02:51:26.270 --> 02:51:29.820
So both attacks you manage to push it away, kick it back.

3782
02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:30.653
It can't even get close enough

3783
02:51:30.653 --> 02:51:31.810
to actually get impact on you.

3784
02:51:31.810 --> 02:51:33.563
The other two are attacking you, Beauregard.

3785
02:51:33.563 --> 02:51:34.940
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Actually,

3786
02:51:34.940 --> 02:51:38.030
because you're big, that one's going to spray you.

3787
02:51:39.735 --> 02:51:42.429
It's going to be that way, so it's not going to get anybody.

3788
02:51:42.429 --> 02:51:47.390
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, please.

3789
02:51:47.390 --> 02:51:49.670
MARISHA: Natural 20.
ALL: Yeah.

3790
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:50.503
MATT: All right.

3791
02:51:50.503 --> 02:51:53.760
So you only take nine points of acid damage

3792
02:51:53.760 --> 02:51:55.800
and you are not restrained.
MARISHA: Cool.

3793
02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:57.860
MATT: The other one's going to attack you twice.

3794
02:51:57.860 --> 02:51:59.600
MARISHA: Cool.

3795
02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:02.970
MATT: That's going to be 16--
MARISHA: Miss.

3796
02:52:02.970 --> 02:52:04.190
MATT: And 18.
MARISHA: Miss.

3797
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:05.023
MATT: Foof!

3798
02:52:06.690 --> 02:52:08.300
That one leaps at you and you just

3799
02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:09.840
bat it onto the ground and it swoops up again

3800
02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:11.310
to strike towards you and you just put your foot out

3801
02:52:11.310 --> 02:52:13.304
and keep it at bay and kick it back.

3802
02:52:13.304 --> 02:52:14.970
Their turn's over.

3803
02:52:14.970 --> 02:52:17.460
Yasha, you're up. Nott, you're on deck.

3804
02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:22.460
ASHLEY: Okay, so since I was not attacked,
I have to rage again?

3805
02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:23.530
Right?
MATT: Since you weren't attacked,

3806
02:52:23.530 --> 02:52:24.840
you do have to.
ASHLEY: Okay.

3807
02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:26.210
MATT: You didn't, but you attacked last round.

3808
02:52:26.210 --> 02:52:28.294
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: It's either attack or be attacked,

3809
02:52:28.294 --> 02:52:29.713
so you're fine, you're still raging.

3810
02:52:29.713 --> 02:52:30.863
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah--

3811
02:52:30.863 --> 02:52:32.320
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to attack

3812
02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:35.903
this one right here with my Skingorger.

3813
02:52:35.903 --> 02:52:37.635
MATT: If you need me to move any of these tree tops,
I can do that for you, too.

3814
02:52:37.635 --> 02:52:39.297
TRAVIS: No, no, it's good, we're mobile

3815
02:52:41.830 --> 02:52:42.663
Kill it.

3816
02:52:43.970 --> 02:52:47.720
ASHLEY: Wait, do I have advantage because of Fjord?

3817
02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:48.670
MATT: Technically, against that one,

3818
02:52:48.670 --> 02:52:50.950
you do have it flanked, so yes, you do--

3819
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:52.540
ASHLEY: Well actually, that might actually--

3820
02:52:52.540 --> 02:52:54.490
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: That hits.

3821
02:52:54.490 --> 02:52:58.080
16. Let me just see if I can get a 20.

3822
02:52:58.080 --> 02:52:59.972
No, okay.
MATT: All right, 16 hits.

3823
02:52:59.972 --> 02:53:01.472
Go ahead and roll damage.

3824
02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:04.657
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll keep that.

3825
02:53:06.310 --> 02:53:07.820
24.

3826
02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:10.670
MATT: 24 points of damage on your first strike.

3827
02:53:10.670 --> 02:53:13.886
That one, you just give one big golf swing, slice it,

3828
02:53:13.886 --> 02:53:17.480
and send it flying across the other side of the jungle

3829
02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:19.430
where you see it vanish behind a rock

3830
02:53:19.430 --> 02:53:21.480
and then squeak out the last of its life.

3831
02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:25.930
ASHLEY: Okay, second attack, can I actually try to

3832
02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:30.692
pull Jester out of her restrain?

3833
02:53:31.774 --> 02:53:33.520
Kind of help her out of the wax

3834
02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:36.180
or whatever is going on?
MATT: Out of the wax?

3835
02:53:36.180 --> 02:53:37.200
Sure, I'll allow it.

3836
02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:38.866
It's like a shove attack to try and push her past it.

3837
02:53:38.866 --> 02:53:39.699
ASHLEY: Okay.

3838
02:53:40.616 --> 02:53:42.419
Would that be like a,

3839
02:53:45.355 --> 02:53:47.250
that's good.
MATT: You move in.

3840
02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:48.891
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

3841
02:53:50.350 --> 02:53:51.890
ASHLEY: 25.

3842
02:53:51.890 --> 02:53:53.060
MATT: Sorry, a strength saving throw.

3843
02:53:53.060 --> 02:53:54.470
My bad.
ASHLEY: Strength--

3844
02:53:54.470 --> 02:53:56.530
MATT: Same roll, but just add your strength save to it--

3845
02:53:56.530 --> 02:53:57.363
ASHLEY: Okay--
MATT: Which you have advantage

3846
02:53:57.363 --> 02:53:58.370
on because you're raging, actually.

3847
02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:59.500
ASHLEY: 26.

3848
02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:01.740
Okay, I'll roll again.

3849
02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:04.640
Yeah, that's better.
TALIESIN: Jesus.

3850
02:54:04.640 --> 02:54:05.900
ASHLEY: 28.
MATT: Okay, you do,

3851
02:54:05.900 --> 02:54:08.230
you push her one space that way,

3852
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:10.240
shoving her out of the cocoon of wax

3853
02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:12.050
that she breaks and stumbles a bit

3854
02:54:12.050 --> 02:54:14.310
and catches herself, but she's no longer restrained.

3855
02:54:14.310 --> 02:54:15.980
SAM: Yay!
ASHLEY: Okay, go do stuff.

3856
02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:17.610
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: All righty.

3857
02:54:17.610 --> 02:54:19.685
Finishing Yasha's go. Nott, you're up.
Caleb, you're on deck.

3858
02:54:19.685 --> 02:54:22.490
SAM: I will retreat to that tree behind me.

3859
02:54:23.570 --> 02:54:25.923
MATT: Right here?
SAM: To your right.

3860
02:54:27.250 --> 02:54:29.700
And bonus action, hide behind it.

3861
02:54:29.700 --> 02:54:33.560
MATT: All right, go ahead and make your stealth check.

3862
02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:36.990
SAM: Terrible, but I have Reliable Talent,

3863
02:54:38.810 --> 02:54:41.080
oh wait, I'm poisoned.

3864
02:54:42.210 --> 02:54:43.043
MATT: Yes.

3865
02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:47.160
Disadvantage attack rolls and ability checks.

3866
02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:48.640
So it'd be just a single roll.

3867
02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:50.200
SAM: Okay, well I rolled twice.

3868
02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:55.291
I'll average them, it came out to a five.

3869
02:54:55.291 --> 02:54:56.473
(laughter)

3870
02:54:56.473 --> 02:54:58.337
But I still have Reliable Talent, so

3871
02:54:58.337 --> 02:55:00.327
it's a 23.

3872
02:55:00.327 --> 02:55:02.680
MATT: (laughs) Fucking rogues.

3873
02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:03.970
All right, you feel pretty stealthed.

3874
02:55:03.970 --> 02:55:08.053
SAM: Okay, then I will use my attack to shoot the one

3875
02:55:08.053 --> 02:55:11.720
behind Caleb, which would be at advantage, but is not.

3876
02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:14.630
MATT: Just a single roll.
SAM: Single roll.

3877
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:17.171
15.
MATT: 15 misses.

3878
02:55:17.171 --> 02:55:19.570
SAM: Ooh, all that action just to--

3879
02:55:19.570 --> 02:55:21.470
MATT: I know. You move behind and fire it.

3880
02:55:21.470 --> 02:55:24.380
As you do it (blows) whips right over its armor,

3881
02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:26.970
ricochets off of its outer shell,

3882
02:55:26.970 --> 02:55:29.280
and shatters against the nearby rock.

3883
02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:31.800
SAM: You're on your own, kid.

3884
02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:33.641
MATT: All right, Nott's done. Caleb, you're up.
Jester, you're on deck.

3885
02:55:33.641 --> 02:55:35.957
LIAM: Caleb is gushing blood and barely standing up

3886
02:55:35.957 --> 02:55:38.470
and he reaches his hand down into his large pack.

3887
02:55:38.470 --> 02:55:40.440
Hand wraps around his transmuter stone

3888
02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:43.640
and suddenly, he balloons up, 15 foot tall giant ape,

3889
02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.480
turns round, and wails the shit out of the bug behind him.

3890
02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:51.563
MATT: You got it.

3891
02:55:53.914 --> 02:55:54.960
LIAM: First one misses, that is a 11.

3892
02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:57.240
MATT: It was an action to cast it?

3893
02:55:57.240 --> 02:55:58.970
LIAM: Oh, right.
SAM: Yeah.

3894
02:55:58.970 --> 02:56:00.040
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm just a giant ape.

3895
02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:01.710
MATT: So you're a giant ape.

3896
02:56:01.710 --> 02:56:04.210
LIAM: I will just turn around and yell at it.

3897
02:56:04.210 --> 02:56:06.310
MATT: All right. (roars)

3898
02:56:06.310 --> 02:56:07.430
You just shout at the creature.

3899
02:56:07.430 --> 02:56:10.800
It withdraws a bit, just not noticing

3900
02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.940
the sort of large array of angry

3901
02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:16.080
actions towards it.

3902
02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:16.950
Of angry.

3903
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:19.080
SAM: On my turn, I wanted to shout out to Caleb:

3904
02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:21.440
Caleb, Dwarven Forge is launching

3905
02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:23.580
their Twitch channel on February 18th.

3906
02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:24.805
MATT: Goddamn it.
SAM: Check it out at

3907
02:56:24.805 --> 02:56:26.720
twitch.tv/DwarvenForgeLive.

3908
02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:28.154
Okay.
LAURA: Woo!

3909
02:56:28.154 --> 02:56:29.336
(laughter)

3910
02:56:29.336 --> 02:56:31.434
LIAM: (panting)

3911
02:56:31.434 --> 02:56:32.475
MATT: All right, finishing Caleb's go.

3912
02:56:32.475 --> 02:56:33.820
Jester, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.

3913
02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:34.947
LIAM: All right, nobody worry about me.

3914
02:56:34.947 --> 02:56:35.780
LAURA: Okay.

3915
02:56:37.230 --> 02:56:39.957
Having watched, I--

3916
02:56:41.566 --> 02:56:42.731
TRAVIS: That changed what you were going to do?

3917
02:56:42.731 --> 02:56:44.227
LAURA: Yep. (laughs)

3918
02:56:44.227 --> 02:56:47.297
That altered my plan.
TALIESIN: Yep, mine too.

3919
02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:53.378
LAURA: Okay. Fuck me running.

3920
02:56:53.378 --> 02:56:54.211
LIAM: That's hard.

3921
02:56:55.689 --> 02:56:57.190
LAURA: (sighs) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3922
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:59.300
That just changed what I was planning on doing.

3923
02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:01.793
Fuck it.

3924
02:57:01.793 --> 02:57:03.150
Okay, I'm going to

3925
02:57:05.689 --> 02:57:07.260
clap my hands together and go:

3926
02:57:07.260 --> 02:57:08.700
All right, let's make this fun.

3927
02:57:08.700 --> 02:57:11.070
And I'm going to Polymorph myself into

3928
02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:14.736
a giant blue mammoth.
MARISHA: Ooh!

3929
02:57:14.736 --> 02:57:16.019
SAM: All right.
TRAVIS: Shit.

3930
02:57:16.019 --> 02:57:17.325
SAM: And there is one.

3931
02:57:17.325 --> 02:57:19.067
(laughter)

3932
02:57:19.067 --> 02:57:20.820
(booming)

3933
02:57:20.820 --> 02:57:22.620
LIAM: This just turned into a Godzilla film.

3934
02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:24.500
LAURA: Yeah.

3935
02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:25.940
TALIESIN: Fjord's right in the butt.

3936
02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:29.048
TRAVIS: Peter Jackson over here!

3937
02:57:29.048 --> 02:57:31.660
MATT: As you (growls) into the forest space,

3938
02:57:31.660 --> 02:57:33.370
Yasha, you see the shadow grow over you

3939
02:57:33.370 --> 02:57:35.090
after Jester shouts out and you turn around

3940
02:57:35.090 --> 02:57:37.632
and you're looking right at a mammoth asshole.

3941
02:57:37.632 --> 02:57:39.230
(laughter)

3942
02:57:39.230 --> 02:57:41.058
Just right there.

3943
02:57:41.058 --> 02:57:42.420
TALIESIN: That's a mean thing to say about Jester.

3944
02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:46.029
TRAVIS: ♪ Black hole sun. ♪
SAM: ♪ Won't you come? ♪

3945
02:57:46.029 --> 02:57:48.186
LIAM: And it's on a pachyderm.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

3946
02:57:48.186 --> 02:57:51.510
MARISHA: Oh. (groans)
MATT: Boom, well done.

3947
02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:52.900
All righty, so that--
LAURA: That's my action.

3948
02:57:52.900 --> 02:57:55.340
MATT: Action to cast it.
LAURA: Yeah, so as a movement,

3949
02:57:55.340 --> 02:58:00.200
I'm going to move forward and turn around.

3950
02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:01.760
MATT: This way?
LAURA: Yeah.

3951
02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:03.230
MATT: All right.

3952
02:58:03.230 --> 02:58:05.590
(stomping) and then turn around.

3953
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:08.390
LAURA: Like, I don't want to be next to the mushroom,

3954
02:58:08.390 --> 02:58:10.390
I want to be a little bit further away from it.

3955
02:58:10.390 --> 02:58:11.730
MATT: But you're staying engaged with that guy there?

3956
02:58:11.730 --> 02:58:13.140
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I slap her ass

3957
02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:15.701
on the way over.
MATT: All righty.

3958
02:58:15.701 --> 02:58:17.419
(slapping)

3959
02:58:17.419 --> 02:58:19.860
(trumpets) Heavy sound of a trumpeting

3960
02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:21.341
in the middle of the jungle.

3961
02:58:21.341 --> 02:58:22.647
LIAM: (mouth trumpet)
MATT: All right, that finishes Jester's turn.

3962
02:58:22.647 --> 02:58:23.900
Caduceus, you're up.
TRAVIS: There it is.

3963
02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:26.710
LAURA: That's better than--
TALIESIN: I am restrained.

3964
02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:27.620
MATT: You are.
Oh no,

3965
02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:29.300
you are not restrained.
TALIESIN: I'm not restrained anymore.

3966
02:58:29.300 --> 02:58:31.660
MATT: Because you made your save.
TALIESIN: Did I make my save?

3967
02:58:31.660 --> 02:58:33.020
MATT: I thought you rolled a natural.

3968
02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:34.020
TALIESIN: I did make my save.

3969
02:58:34.020 --> 02:58:36.017
Jesus, I keep forgetting.

3970
02:58:36.017 --> 02:58:39.200
All right, am I in melee with anybody?

3971
02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:40.390
MATT: You are in melee with one of them.

3972
02:58:40.390 --> 02:58:43.260
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to hit that one

3973
02:58:43.260 --> 02:58:45.530
with the Sacred Flame.
MATT: All righty.

3974
02:58:45.530 --> 02:58:47.610
The same, oh this is a different one.

3975
02:58:47.610 --> 02:58:48.974
TALIESIN: This is a different one.

3976
02:58:48.974 --> 02:58:50.880
MATT: And it's-- ooh, it's a fail.

3977
02:58:50.880 --> 02:58:52.160
TALIESIN: Oh yay.
MATT: That's a nine.

3978
02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:54.150
TALIESIN: That's nice.
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

3979
02:58:54.150 --> 02:58:55.570
TALIESIN: That's a--

3980
02:58:56.462 --> 02:58:58.150
That's better, that's better, okay.

3981
02:58:58.150 --> 02:59:00.990
That's 20 points of radiant damage.

3982
02:59:00.990 --> 02:59:02.446
MATT: 20 points of radiant damage.

3983
02:59:02.446 --> 02:59:04.580
It flares up, it burns across,

3984
02:59:04.580 --> 02:59:07.050
and its outer shell is now turned black

3985
02:59:07.050 --> 02:59:08.610
and elements of it have cracked open

3986
02:59:08.610 --> 02:59:10.340
from the immediate radiant heat.

3987
02:59:10.340 --> 02:59:12.590
But it's still standing, though very, very hurt.

3988
02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:15.970
TALIESIN: Last chance, all right.
MATT: Finishes your go?

3989
02:59:15.970 --> 02:59:16.960
TALIESIN: Yeah, I ain't going nowhere.

3990
02:59:16.960 --> 02:59:18.331
MATT: Top of the round.

3991
02:59:18.331 --> 02:59:20.990
Beauregard, you're up.
MARISHA: (roars) It's a kaiju fight

3992
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:22.690
and I'm going to stomp on that one.

3993
02:59:22.690 --> 02:59:24.450
LIAM: No, you are small now.
MARISHA: Over there.

3994
02:59:24.450 --> 02:59:25.714
LAURA: You're small now.
MARISHA: No, I'm small?

3995
02:59:25.714 --> 02:59:29.812
LIAM: Because I'm big.
MARISHA: Aww, poops.

3996
02:59:29.812 --> 02:59:31.461
TRAVIS: But you still walk over, like--

3997
02:59:31.461 --> 02:59:33.120
MARISHA: (roaring)

3998
02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:37.040
MATT: As this is happening,
Beauregard stomps over to that one,

3999
02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:39.230
going (roars) and it's just like,

4000
02:59:39.230 --> 02:59:42.019
here comes a normal Beauregard.

4001
02:59:42.019 --> 02:59:44.335
You go to stomp and suddenly,

4002
02:59:44.335 --> 02:59:46.673
it's much larger than you remember.

4003
02:59:46.673 --> 02:59:48.923
(laughter)

4004
02:59:51.594 --> 02:59:54.296
MARISHA: My perspective changes.

4005
02:59:54.296 --> 02:59:56.406
MATT: So what're you doing?

4006
02:59:56.406 --> 02:59:58.073
(laughter)

4007
02:59:58.073 --> 03:00:01.080
MARISHA: I'm still going to punt the one that's next to me.

4008
03:00:01.080 --> 03:00:02.320
MATT: All righty, go ahead and--

4009
03:00:02.320 --> 03:00:04.439
MARISHA: Kicking that one--
ASHLEY: I need a clip of that.

4010
03:00:04.439 --> 03:00:07.605
ALL: (roaring)

4011
03:00:07.605 --> 03:00:08.454
(laughter)

4012
03:00:08.454 --> 03:00:09.412
ASHLEY: Oh, that was too cute.

4013
03:00:09.412 --> 03:00:13.630
MARISHA: Okay, punchies, punchies, punting.

4014
03:00:13.630 --> 03:00:15.530
Yeah, that's good.

4015
03:00:15.530 --> 03:00:17.790
26.
MATT: 26 hits.

4016
03:00:17.790 --> 03:00:20.120
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take that. That's fine.

4017
03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:23.100
10 damage on that one.
MATT: 10 damage?

4018
03:00:23.100 --> 03:00:23.933
MARISHA: Yep.

4019
03:00:23.933 --> 03:00:25.340
He's still alive?
MATT: Still alive.

4020
03:00:25.340 --> 03:00:26.840
MARISHA: Second hit.

4021
03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:28.802
Yeah, 28.
MATT: That hits.

4022
03:00:30.103 --> 03:00:33.090
MARISHA: That's even better, 12.
MATT: 12 points of damage?

4023
03:00:33.090 --> 03:00:34.790
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: You walk over

4024
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:36.238
and kick it and then spin around

4025
03:00:36.238 --> 03:00:37.990
with your staff to smack it a second time.

4026
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:39.710
It falls on its back and gets up back up.

4027
03:00:39.710 --> 03:00:42.020
It's barely standing, its legs are quivering,

4028
03:00:42.020 --> 03:00:42.853
but it's still standing.

4029
03:00:42.853 --> 03:00:46.636
MARISHA: I just (groans)

4030
03:00:46.636 --> 03:00:48.120
and then Flurry of Blows.

4031
03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:50.770
I'm going to take my staff and I just (groans)--

4032
03:00:50.770 --> 03:00:51.995
MATT: Just repeatedly bludgeon it.

4033
03:00:51.995 --> 03:00:55.487
Okay, go ahead and roll.
MARISHA: Goddamn it!

4034
03:00:55.487 --> 03:00:57.060
Pop pop!

4035
03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:59.800
Okay, there's a 26 and 13.

4036
03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:00.990
I don't think the 13 hits.

4037
03:01:00.990 --> 03:01:04.231
MATT: 13 does not hit, but the 26--
MARISHA: But the 26!

4038
03:01:06.050 --> 03:01:08.560
10 again.
MATT: You just

4039
03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:11.660
whack, whack, whack, it's no longer moving,

4040
03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:14.080
and whack, whack, whack and you see now

4041
03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:15.575
the purple ooze is (squirting)

4042
03:01:15.575 --> 03:01:17.571
just coming off on the staff and arcing.

4043
03:01:17.571 --> 03:01:18.903
TRAVIS: Oh whoa, nice shooting, Tex!

4044
03:01:18.903 --> 03:01:20.800
MARISHA: I just keep going as a little tear

4045
03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:22.207
comes out the corner of my eye.

4046
03:01:22.207 --> 03:01:23.368
(laughter)

4047
03:01:23.368 --> 03:01:25.380
MATT: All right, Beau, you're done. Fjord, you're up.

4048
03:01:25.380 --> 03:01:26.213
Unless you want to move, Beau.

4049
03:01:26.213 --> 03:01:27.429
You can move still.
MARISHA: No.

4050
03:01:27.429 --> 03:01:28.262
MATT: Okay, you're staying there,

4051
03:01:28.262 --> 03:01:29.928
just hitting the corpse. You got it.
MARISHA: Yep.

4052
03:01:29.928 --> 03:01:31.430
TRAVIS: I'm restrained, yes?
MATT: You are restrained.

4053
03:01:31.430 --> 03:01:34.900
TRAVIS: I will bleh-bleh-ba-bleh-bleh-bleh--

4054
03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:36.686
SAM: Turn into a giant dinosaur.

4055
03:01:36.686 --> 03:01:39.809
(laughter)

4056
03:01:39.809 --> 03:01:41.545
TRAVIS: I'll send--
MATT: Sure, why not?

4057
03:01:41.545 --> 03:01:43.473
Everyone else is doing it.
LIAM: (screeching)

4058
03:01:43.473 --> 03:01:46.880
TRAVIS: I'll send one Eldritch Blast right here

4059
03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:49.170
towards the middle one that's here.

4060
03:01:49.170 --> 03:01:50.320
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: That one.

4061
03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:52.457
MATT: Roll for attack.

4062
03:01:52.457 --> 03:01:55.420
TRAVIS: Jesus, that's an 18.
MATT: 18 hits.

4063
03:01:55.420 --> 03:01:58.420
TRAVIS: Great. (stutters like reversing audio)

4064
03:02:00.627 --> 03:02:02.990
10 points of force damage.
MATT: 10 points of force damage to that one?

4065
03:02:02.990 --> 03:02:04.294
All righty.
TRAVIS: Is it still up?

4066
03:02:04.294 --> 03:02:05.873
MATT: Still up, that one hasn't been touched yet.

4067
03:02:05.873 --> 03:02:07.398
TRAVIS: Oh great.
MATT: But you've just blasted it,

4068
03:02:07.398 --> 03:02:08.231
it's now taken some hit.

4069
03:02:08.231 --> 03:02:09.590
It's still looking good, but it's hurt.

4070
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:11.440
TRAVIS: I'll send another one that way.

4071
03:02:11.440 --> 03:02:13.450
(groans) Less good, 13 points.

4072
03:02:13.450 --> 03:02:15.400
MATT: 13 misses.
MARISHA: Pooper.

4073
03:02:15.400 --> 03:02:17.320
MATT: Now being hit once, it turns towards you

4074
03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:18.380
and as you release the second blast,

4075
03:02:18.380 --> 03:02:21.430
it skitters by the mushroom and the ground bursts

4076
03:02:21.430 --> 03:02:24.190
with dust and dirt where it no longer stands.

4077
03:02:24.190 --> 03:02:26.740
Then crawls back in the space it once was.

4078
03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:28.750
TRAVIS: With my bonus action--

4079
03:02:30.214 --> 03:02:31.560
I don't think I can cast Hex

4080
03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:34.340
after I've done two attacks, right?

4081
03:02:34.340 --> 03:02:36.520
MATT: You can because Eldritch Blast is a--

4082
03:02:37.380 --> 03:02:38.480
TRAVIS: It's a cantrip.
MATT: It's a cantrip,

4083
03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:39.560
so you can cast Hex if you want.

4084
03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:44.360
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll cast Hex on that guy that ran away

4085
03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:45.810
that I missed.
MATT: You got it.

4086
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:49.235
That guy is Hexed.

4087
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:52.600
All right.
TALIESIN: Top of the round already?

4088
03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:54.434
MATT: That finishes your turn?
TRAVIS: Yes.

4089
03:02:54.434 --> 03:02:56.084
MATT: All right, now it's their turn.

4090
03:02:57.078 --> 03:02:58.386
(insect skittering)

4091
03:02:58.386 --> 03:02:59.587
SAM: I look to the top of the mammoth

4092
03:02:59.587 --> 03:03:02.862
where there's a tiny

4093
03:03:02.862 --> 03:03:04.570
Sprinkle just hanging on.

4094
03:03:04.570 --> 03:03:07.610
(laughter)

4095
03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:10.190
MATT: This one here, it was going to go for Caduceus,

4096
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:14.880
but then a giant mammoth came and it's...

4097
03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:17.450
LAURA: It's going to attack the mammoth?

4098
03:03:18.750 --> 03:03:19.770
SAM: Boy oh boy.

4099
03:03:19.770 --> 03:03:21.410
They don't have a lot of good options.

4100
03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:23.457
MATT: Nope, that one's going to flee.

4101
03:03:23.457 --> 03:03:24.548
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot at it

4102
03:03:24.548 --> 03:03:25.381
as it leaves.
LAURA: It's going to flee!?

4103
03:03:25.381 --> 03:03:26.214
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Do I also get to

4104
03:03:26.214 --> 03:03:27.660
take a shot at it as it leaves?

4105
03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:28.493
MATT: You do.

4106
03:03:28.493 --> 03:03:30.180
It's going to go ahead and run past all three of you.

4107
03:03:30.180 --> 03:03:31.350
TALIESIN: Does Sacred Flame count as--

4108
03:03:31.350 --> 03:03:34.210
since I'm a battle mage, does Sacred Flame count as a--

4109
03:03:34.210 --> 03:03:35.770
MATT: If you're a War Caster--
TALIESIN: I'm War Caster.

4110
03:03:35.770 --> 03:03:37.130
MATT: I believe that allows you to do cantrip

4111
03:03:37.130 --> 03:03:38.080
as a--
LAURA: 26.

4112
03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:38.913
TALIESIN: I'll do Sacred Flame on him

4113
03:03:38.913 --> 03:03:40.346
as he runs.
LAURA: Dead.

4114
03:03:40.346 --> 03:03:41.187
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind,

4115
03:03:41.187 --> 03:03:43.160
you go first.
MATT: 26 hits.

4116
03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:44.820
Go ahead and roll damage.
TRAVIS: 26.

4117
03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:46.070
MATT: That hits as well.

4118
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:47.701
ASHLEY: Do we all-- we all get a hit, yeah?

4119
03:03:47.701 --> 03:03:48.870
TALIESIN: I'm holding to see where it goes.

4120
03:03:48.870 --> 03:03:50.100
MATT: Well, first it's Jester.

4121
03:03:50.100 --> 03:03:51.190
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Hold on, hold on--

4122
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:52.330
TALIESIN: Jester may just fry the thing.

4123
03:03:52.330 --> 03:03:53.505
ASHLEY: Get it, get it.

4124
03:03:55.933 --> 03:03:56.766
LAURA: Uh.

4125
03:04:00.940 --> 03:04:02.720
15

4126
03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:03.690
plus 7.

4127
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:06.240
MATT: 15?

4128
03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:07.630
LAURA: Plus seven.
MATT: Plus seven.

4129
03:04:07.630 --> 03:04:08.970
It spins around and begins to skitter away

4130
03:04:08.970 --> 03:04:12.550
and you just (slam) and before anything

4131
03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:14.220
gets to the rest of you, it is scattered

4132
03:04:14.220 --> 03:04:16.070
across the floor of the jungle there.

4133
03:04:18.170 --> 03:04:21.420
This one here is going to continue to attack the gorilla,

4134
03:04:21.420 --> 03:04:23.840
which it seems a little less intimidated by.

4135
03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:28.840
Both attacks against it are a 16 and a 17.

4136
03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:31.280
LIAM: To hit the--
MATT: To hit you.

4137
03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:33.497
LIAM: <i>Mein affe</i>?

4138
03:04:34.761 --> 03:04:35.930
Well, they were-- yes, they both hit.

4139
03:04:35.930 --> 03:04:38.338
MATT: All right. The first one does

4140
03:04:38.338 --> 03:04:39.238
five points of piercing damage

4141
03:04:39.238 --> 03:04:42.040
and six points of acid damage, so 11 total.

4142
03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:43.016
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4143
03:04:43.016 --> 03:04:46.320
MATT: And then the second attack does 14 points

4144
03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:48.320
of slashing damage.
LIAM: Okay.

4145
03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:49.610
MATT: All right.

4146
03:04:49.610 --> 03:04:51.940
That finishes that one's go and there is one

4147
03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:56.190
attacking Beau and one attacking Fjord that it got Hexed by.

4148
03:04:56.190 --> 03:04:58.396
The one attacking Beauregard.
MARISHA: Hit me.

4149
03:04:58.396 --> 03:05:00.860
MATT: It's going to be a 14.

4150
03:05:00.860 --> 03:05:01.693
MARISHA: Miss.

4151
03:05:01.693 --> 03:05:03.410
MATT: Second attack is a natural one.

4152
03:05:03.410 --> 03:05:05.130
You just, (whipping noises) just completely

4153
03:05:05.130 --> 03:05:06.700
dodge around it. It can't even get near you.

4154
03:05:06.700 --> 03:05:07.560
TRAVIS: Dodge the lobster.

4155
03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:08.770
MATT: The other one is attacking you twice.

4156
03:05:08.770 --> 03:05:10.110
You are restrained still, Fjord,

4157
03:05:10.110 --> 03:05:11.310
so it gets advantage on these strikes.

4158
03:05:11.310 --> 03:05:14.000
TRAVIS: It does.
MATT: Oof, that's going to be a 24.

4159
03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:15.370
TRAVIS: That hits.

4160
03:05:15.370 --> 03:05:17.040
MATT: And a natural 20.
TALIESIN: Countered.

4161
03:05:17.040 --> 03:05:18.672
MARISHA: Oh jeez.
MATT: Countered

4162
03:05:18.672 --> 03:05:19.960
because you can do that.
TRAVIS: Thank you--

4163
03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:21.540
MATT: No-- yes you can, because you didn't

4164
03:05:21.540 --> 03:05:23.230
spend your reaction doing that.

4165
03:05:23.230 --> 03:05:24.400
TALIESIN: (New Jersey accent) That's why you don't go.

4166
03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:26.957
That's why you maintain some discipline.

4167
03:05:26.957 --> 03:05:29.207
(laughter)

4168
03:05:30.080 --> 03:05:32.911
SAM: (same accent) Maintain some discipline.
LAURA: (same accent) Maintain some discipline.

4169
03:05:32.911 --> 03:05:34.236
ASHLEY: (same accent) That's why
you maintain some discipline.

4170
03:05:34.236 --> 03:05:35.940
MATT: It's important, guys, to have some discipline.

4171
03:05:35.940 --> 03:05:38.130
TRAVIS: (New Jersey accent) Don't go outside with wet hair.

4172
03:05:38.130 --> 03:05:40.662
MATT: All right, the first bite attack against you,

4173
03:05:40.662 --> 03:05:43.445
Fjord, that's going to be--

4174
03:05:43.445 --> 03:05:45.211
SAM: (New Jersey accent) Always wear your rubbers.

4175
03:05:45.211 --> 03:05:46.940
MATT: Six, 13 points of damage total.

4176
03:05:46.940 --> 03:05:48.440
TRAVIS: Okay.

4177
03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:52.460
MATT: The second attack, oof, is
15 points of slashing damage.

4178
03:05:52.460 --> 03:05:54.220
TRAVIS: Wow, okay. (sniffs)

4179
03:05:54.220 --> 03:05:56.262
MATT: So I think a total of 31 or something like that.

4180
03:05:56.262 --> 03:05:59.380
TRAVIS: Oh, and on both of those because the sword

4181
03:05:59.380 --> 03:06:01.320
does some shit--
MATT: Yep.

4182
03:06:01.320 --> 03:06:04.192
TRAVIS: It is a-- dealing-- wow, really?

4183
03:06:04.192 --> 03:06:05.484
I got to remember that more often,

4184
03:06:05.484 --> 03:06:07.868
I think I've been forgetting that.

4185
03:06:07.868 --> 03:06:08.701
MARISHA: Oh good!

4186
03:06:08.701 --> 03:06:10.050
TRAVIS: Eight.

4187
03:06:10.050 --> 03:06:12.530
14 points of radiant damage.
MARISHA: Ooh yeah.

4188
03:06:12.530 --> 03:06:13.910
MATT: 14 points of radiant damage?
TRAVIS: Yeah--

4189
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:14.870
MATT: Nice.

4190
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:18.587
(shattering sounds) It just, the light sprays from it.

4191
03:06:18.587 --> 03:06:19.560
It's looking hurt.

4192
03:06:20.530 --> 03:06:23.140
All righty, that finishes their turn.

4193
03:06:23.140 --> 03:06:26.068
Yasha, you're up.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4194
03:06:26.068 --> 03:06:27.490
All right, I'm going to try and make my way

4195
03:06:27.490 --> 03:06:29.810
to wherever the nearest one is.

4196
03:06:29.810 --> 03:06:31.390
MATT: There's one with the gorilla here

4197
03:06:31.390 --> 03:06:32.680
and then there's the one that's hexed by Fjord,

4198
03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:33.720
the one that's fighting Beau.

4199
03:06:33.720 --> 03:06:37.140
ASHLEY: Okay, let's go to, let's go to the one by Caleb.

4200
03:06:38.243 --> 03:06:39.276
MATT: One by Caleb?

4201
03:06:39.276 --> 03:06:41.360
ASHLEY: Even though I'm sure the gorilla has got it.

4202
03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:44.490
MATT: You push through the bush
and rush up, blade in the air.

4203
03:06:44.490 --> 03:06:45.323
Go ahead and make your attacks.

4204
03:06:45.323 --> 03:06:48.630
SAM: Yasha pushes through the bush.
LAURA: (cackles)

4205
03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:50.950
ASHLEY: Natural 20.
MATT: Yeah, that'll do.

4206
03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:52.270
TRAVIS: Natural 20?

4207
03:06:52.270 --> 03:06:53.830
(cheering)

4208
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:55.611
SAM: Counter.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4209
03:06:55.611 --> 03:06:57.560
(laughter)

4210
03:06:57.560 --> 03:06:58.626
ASHLEY: Okay, so,

4211
03:06:59.780 --> 03:07:00.613
six--

4212
03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:03.828
MATT: You can reroll--
ASHLEY: Savage Attacker so I'm going to--

4213
03:07:03.828 --> 03:07:05.028
MATT: Yeah, because it looks like two ones--

4214
03:07:05.028 --> 03:07:06.482
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4215
03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:08.949
MATT: The same!
ASHLEY: I rolled exactly the same.

4216
03:07:08.949 --> 03:07:09.960
MATT: The exact same.

4217
03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:11.110
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

4218
03:07:12.980 --> 03:07:14.410
MARISHA: C'mon, checkers.

4219
03:07:14.410 --> 03:07:17.430
ASHLEY: Well, 18.
MATT: 18 plus your

4220
03:07:17.430 --> 03:07:19.490
brutal critical, which--

4221
03:07:19.490 --> 03:07:20.323
TRAVIS: You re-roll all your damage--

4222
03:07:20.323 --> 03:07:21.220
MATT: Well, it's not re-roll.

4223
03:07:21.220 --> 03:07:23.647
This is, you get additional.

4224
03:07:23.647 --> 03:07:24.770
LAURA: D12?
MATT: Which, at this level--

4225
03:07:24.770 --> 03:07:27.650
ASHLEY: You can roll one additional weapon damage die

4226
03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:29.280
when determining the extra damage

4227
03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:30.690
for a critical hit with a melee attack.

4228
03:07:30.690 --> 03:07:31.820
MATT: So roll an additional d6 for that.

4229
03:07:31.820 --> 03:07:32.970
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: So 18 plus?

4230
03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:35.250
ASHLEY: Two.

4231
03:07:35.250 --> 03:07:36.330
MATT: 20 points of damage to that.

4232
03:07:36.330 --> 03:07:38.360
TALIESIN: Do you double that die, too?

4233
03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:39.193
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: No.

4234
03:07:39.193 --> 03:07:40.026
TALIESIN: Okay.

4235
03:07:40.026 --> 03:07:41.044
MATT: All right, so 20 points on the first strike.

4236
03:07:41.044 --> 03:07:44.660
You rush up and slam! The blade sticks into it

4237
03:07:44.660 --> 03:07:46.218
and is jammed in it and you hear it going

4238
03:07:46.218 --> 03:07:47.690
(insect chitter) trying to pull away,

4239
03:07:47.690 --> 03:07:48.523
but it's stuck in there.

4240
03:07:48.523 --> 03:07:49.470
Go ahead and roll your second attack.

4241
03:07:49.470 --> 03:07:51.510
ASHLEY: Okay. Ugh, cocked.

4242
03:07:51.510 --> 03:07:52.720
SAM: Always.
ASHLEY: Cocked again, sorry.

4243
03:07:52.720 --> 03:07:54.228
LAURA: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

4244
03:07:54.228 --> 03:07:55.890
Oh, this is not going to hit.

4245
03:07:55.890 --> 03:07:58.150
That's 11.

4246
03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:59.520
MATT: 11?
ASHLEY: Uh huh.

4247
03:07:59.520 --> 03:08:01.088
MATT: No, that's not going to hit.

4248
03:08:01.088 --> 03:08:02.754
(laughter)
MATT: Don't forget, you have Reckless Attack,

4249
03:08:02.754 --> 03:08:04.590
so if you're not worried about being attacked back--

4250
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:06.480
ASHLEY: Oh shit! I always forget about that.

4251
03:08:06.480 --> 03:08:07.910
Can I do it or should I wait 'til the next time--

4252
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:08.870
MATT: I'll let you do it--
ASHLEY: I'll wait 'til the next time.

4253
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:10.355
MATT: I'll let you do it, I'll let you do it, it's fine.

4254
03:08:10.355 --> 03:08:11.188
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

4255
03:08:11.188 --> 03:08:12.306
MATT: But keep that in mind, keep that in mind.

4256
03:08:12.306 --> 03:08:14.122
That's one of the big tools of the barbarian.

4257
03:08:14.122 --> 03:08:15.630
ASHLEY: Fucking shit.
SAM: Cocked.

4258
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:16.463
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: There you go.

4259
03:08:16.463 --> 03:08:17.579
SAM: This dice.

4260
03:08:17.579 --> 03:08:18.990
ASHLEY: I know! I'm sorry, I like it.
TALIESIN: That one die.

4261
03:08:18.990 --> 03:08:20.050
I know you love that die.

4262
03:08:20.050 --> 03:08:21.660
ASHLEY: 24.
MATT: That does hit.

4263
03:08:21.660 --> 03:08:22.897
Go ahead and roll damage.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4264
03:08:22.897 --> 03:08:24.705
(laughter)

4265
03:08:25.930 --> 03:08:28.112
SAM: Takes six rolls to get one good one.

4266
03:08:28.112 --> 03:08:29.900
TALIESIN: Put a metal plate in there so it falls--

4267
03:08:29.900 --> 03:08:31.220
ASHLEY: 12 points of damage.

4268
03:08:31.220 --> 03:08:32.810
MATT: 12 points of damage.
SAM: Yay!

4269
03:08:32.810 --> 03:08:35.920
MATT: All right, you pull the blade out and the jagged part

4270
03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:38.610
of the Skingorger tears through its body,

4271
03:08:38.610 --> 03:08:40.440
scattering some of its core across the rock.

4272
03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:41.880
It's still standing, but it's hurt

4273
03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:43.904
real badly.
ASHLEY: Fuck you!

4274
03:08:43.904 --> 03:08:45.235
MATT: Nott, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

4275
03:08:45.235 --> 03:08:47.340
SAM: I'm up? I get more turns?
MATT: You do.

4276
03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:51.180
SAM: I'm going to-- where's that one that Yasha was just--

4277
03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:52.650
TALIESIN: Right there.

4278
03:08:52.650 --> 03:08:54.300
SAM: In front of the grape ape?
MATT: Yep.

4279
03:08:55.258 --> 03:08:56.360
LIAM: Which tree is Nott in?

4280
03:08:56.360 --> 03:08:58.230
SAM: I'm behind, I'm so stealthy you can't see me.

4281
03:08:58.230 --> 03:08:59.490
TALIESIN: I love this forest--
LAURA: Oh wow, yeah--

4282
03:08:59.490 --> 03:09:01.210
TALIESIN: It's just so hard to see through, it's great.

4283
03:09:01.210 --> 03:09:02.280
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: It makes me happy.

4284
03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:05.760
SAM: I'm going to stealthily try to poach

4285
03:09:05.760 --> 03:09:07.780
the one that Yasha was just hitting.

4286
03:09:07.780 --> 03:09:10.740
TRAVIS: You killed the mammoth!
LAURA: No!

4287
03:09:10.740 --> 03:09:11.879
TALIESIN: Don't spoil the illusion.

4288
03:09:11.879 --> 03:09:13.229
LIAM: (trumpeting)

4289
03:09:13.229 --> 03:09:15.060
MATT: I like moving the pieces, sorry.

4290
03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:17.810
SAM: Actually, I fired at this one last time

4291
03:09:17.810 --> 03:09:19.641
from the same position.
MATT: You did.

4292
03:09:19.641 --> 03:09:21.540
SAM: Do I have to re-hide?

4293
03:09:21.540 --> 03:09:24.280
MATT: If you want to have non-disadvantage--

4294
03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:26.310
SAM: I will bonus action, re-hide.

4295
03:09:26.310 --> 03:09:27.620
MATT: All right, so you'll have to move.

4296
03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:29.060
There's enough of a bush here that you could--

4297
03:09:29.060 --> 03:09:30.280
LIAM: Do you have to hide if I'm adjacent?

4298
03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:31.688
LAURA: That is enough of a bush.

4299
03:09:31.688 --> 03:09:33.930
SAM: Because I have a-- yes, I do.

4300
03:09:33.930 --> 03:09:36.060
Because I'm at disadvantage on these attacks.

4301
03:09:36.060 --> 03:09:38.401
MATT: That's right.
LIAM: But you get advantage if your buddy--

4302
03:09:38.401 --> 03:09:40.902
SAM: No, you don't get advantage,
you get sneak attack damage

4303
03:09:40.902 --> 03:09:43.369
unless you are rolling at a disadvantage.

4304
03:09:43.369 --> 03:09:44.681
MATT: Disadvantage does not give you sneak attack.

4305
03:09:44.681 --> 03:09:47.065
SAM: Yeah. So this is a single, straight roll.

4306
03:09:47.065 --> 03:09:48.445
Oh! Fucking had to roll one.

4307
03:09:48.445 --> 03:09:50.237
LAURA: Fucking hell!
(laughter)

4308
03:09:50.237 --> 03:09:52.320
MATT: So you miss and you damage yourself.

4309
03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:53.153
SAM: Oh, that's right!

4310
03:09:53.153 --> 03:09:54.733
LAURA: Oh no, Nott!
SAM: That's right.

4311
03:09:54.733 --> 03:09:55.566
What does the--

4312
03:09:55.566 --> 03:09:57.251
what does it do?
LAURA: What did you do?

4313
03:09:57.251 --> 03:09:58.084
SAM: What does it do?

4314
03:09:58.084 --> 03:09:59.550
What does it say?
TALIESIN: Schproing!

4315
03:09:59.550 --> 03:10:03.160
SAM: When you roll a one, you suffer one D6 piercing damage.

4316
03:10:03.160 --> 03:10:04.680
MATT: Go for it.
LAURA: Oh!

4317
03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:05.980
SAM: That's a six.

4318
03:10:05.980 --> 03:10:08.360
(laughter)

4319
03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:09.820
MATT: You rush, hide, dive through in the bush,

4320
03:10:09.820 --> 03:10:11.759
turn around and fire and it just goes (impact)--

4321
03:10:11.759 --> 03:10:13.450
SAM: (screaming)

4322
03:10:13.450 --> 03:10:15.770
MATT: -- back into you. Nott, does that finish your turn?

4323
03:10:15.770 --> 03:10:16.973
TRAVIS: You okay there?

4324
03:10:16.973 --> 03:10:18.750
SAM: (screaming)

4325
03:10:18.750 --> 03:10:19.583
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

4326
03:10:19.583 --> 03:10:24.583
MATT: All right, so begin what I was
trying to do before, smash it.

4327
03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:27.760
That is a 27 to hit.

4328
03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:30.293
MATT: 27 hits.
LIAM: Okay.

4329
03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:33.800
That is a

4330
03:10:35.372 --> 03:10:37.072
22.
MATT: 22 points of damage.

4331
03:10:37.072 --> 03:10:40.440
You squash that thing like the bug it is.

4332
03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:42.690
LIAM: For flavor, I'll say he just does it with a palm,

4333
03:10:42.690 --> 03:10:44.170
goes (slam), and then just takes the body

4334
03:10:44.170 --> 03:10:46.800
and chucks it into the underbrush and I'm going to--

4335
03:10:46.800 --> 03:10:50.090
MATT: It sprays part of you, Yasha, and then as

4336
03:10:50.090 --> 03:10:53.140
the monkey lifts it, it (raspberries) goes up against

4337
03:10:53.140 --> 03:10:55.680
the rest of you and you are just coated in purple.

4338
03:10:55.680 --> 03:10:56.940
LIAM: So when he chucks it, he just goes--

4339
03:10:56.940 --> 03:10:58.998
ASHLEY: I like it--
MATT: It just (blows)--

4340
03:10:58.998 --> 03:10:59.831
ASHLEY: Yep.

4341
03:10:59.831 --> 03:11:03.097
LIAM: Then he's going to King Kong over towards the group

4342
03:11:03.097 --> 03:11:04.222
40 feet,

4343
03:11:04.222 --> 03:11:05.230
look over their shoulders--

4344
03:11:05.230 --> 03:11:06.080
MATT: You have to go around this way.

4345
03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:07.218
There's not enough room to go--

4346
03:11:07.218 --> 03:11:09.002
LIAM: Sure.
MATT: (stomping)

4347
03:11:09.002 --> 03:11:11.680
Stomping over there, you crush

4348
03:11:11.680 --> 03:11:13.430
that element there and there is one

4349
03:11:13.430 --> 03:11:15.560
right next to Beauregard that you can get to.

4350
03:11:15.560 --> 03:11:18.380
LIAM: Right. (pants) (ape pounding)

4351
03:11:18.380 --> 03:11:19.621
MATT: Go for it.

4352
03:11:19.621 --> 03:11:22.087
LIAM: That is a 17 to hit.

4353
03:11:23.427 --> 03:11:24.260
17,

4354
03:11:25.352 --> 03:11:28.140
17, 24,

4355
03:11:28.140 --> 03:11:29.640
30.
MATT: 13?

4356
03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:30.830
LIAM: 30.
MATT: 30?

4357
03:11:30.830 --> 03:11:32.735
30 hits, yeah, yeah.
LIAM: Oh no, I hit.

4358
03:11:32.735 --> 03:11:34.400
30 damage.
MATT: Oh, gotcha.

4359
03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:36.130
SAM: Ooh, wow.
TALIESIN: Wow.

4360
03:11:36.130 --> 03:11:37.300
MATT: 30 damage.

4361
03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:38.640
That one had not been damaged yet

4362
03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:41.060
and as you slam down both your fists, you smash into

4363
03:11:41.060 --> 03:11:43.330
the ground and its legs go flat for a second.

4364
03:11:43.330 --> 03:11:44.910
You pull back, thinking it's probably dead,

4365
03:11:44.910 --> 03:11:47.707
and it slowly (cracking) gets back up.

4366
03:11:47.707 --> 03:11:49.670
LIAM: (growling)

4367
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:51.480
AMTT: Angry Caleb is angry.

4368
03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:52.790
Finishing Caleb's go, Jester, you're up.

4369
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:53.690
Caduceus, you're on deck.

4370
03:11:53.690 --> 03:11:55.215
LAURA: Can I get to it?

4371
03:11:56.860 --> 03:11:58.380
LAURA: You can push past this tree and try for it.

4372
03:11:58.380 --> 03:11:59.980
SAM: Just knock that tree over.

4373
03:11:59.980 --> 03:12:02.700
TRAVIS: Fuck that tree.
MATT: Make a strength check for me.

4374
03:12:02.700 --> 03:12:03.975
LAURA: Oh, man.

4375
03:12:03.975 --> 03:12:05.320
LIAM: (trumpeting)

4376
03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:06.864
MATT: Mammoth strength check.

4377
03:12:06.864 --> 03:12:09.350
SAM: (lower quality trumpeting)

4378
03:12:09.350 --> 03:12:11.756
LAURA: Yeah, 25.

4379
03:12:11.756 --> 03:12:14.418
(laughter)

4380
03:12:14.418 --> 03:12:16.675
SAM: They had that mammoth toking.

4381
03:12:16.675 --> 03:12:18.391
LAURA: Awesome!

4382
03:12:18.391 --> 03:12:20.480
(cheering)

4383
03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:23.116
MATT: You push over into this space.

4384
03:12:23.116 --> 03:12:24.877
LAURA: (roaring)

4385
03:12:24.877 --> 03:12:27.110
MATT: Pushing it back.
LIAM: This is a sacred place.

4386
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:29.532
MARISHA: She's fine with it.
MATT: Yep.

4387
03:12:29.532 --> 03:12:32.720
The tree just slams, sending all sorts of

4388
03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:34.610
loose leaves and dust up into the air.

4389
03:12:34.610 --> 03:12:36.640
LAURA: Does that count because it's weirdly--

4390
03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:37.473
MATT: Are you attacking the hexed one

4391
03:12:37.473 --> 03:12:38.710
or the one that he tried to smash?

4392
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:40.350
LAURA: The one that, oh, is there more than one?

4393
03:12:40.350 --> 03:12:41.630
LIAM and MATT: There's two.

4394
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:43.650
LAURA: Oh, shit.
LIAM: The one that I smooshed--

4395
03:12:43.650 --> 03:12:46.708
LAURA: Oh, well, I'll do the one--

4396
03:12:48.960 --> 03:12:50.810
I'll do the hexed one.
MATT: All right, go for it.

4397
03:12:50.810 --> 03:12:52.269
SAM: I'll do the hexed--
MATT: So that attack was?

4398
03:12:52.269 --> 03:12:54.860
LAURA: That was 16.
MATT: 16 just hits.

4399
03:12:54.860 --> 03:12:57.743
SAM: Ooh, nice.
LAURA: Ooh, close call.

4400
03:13:01.060 --> 03:13:02.240
Six

4401
03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:04.930
plus nine is 15 plus four is

4402
03:13:06.040 --> 03:13:08.960
19 plus seven is 26.

4403
03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:10.190
MATT: 26 to that one?

4404
03:13:11.810 --> 03:13:14.020
After pushing the tree with your body,

4405
03:13:14.020 --> 03:13:18.047
as its cracking down, you splat that one that's hexed.

4406
03:13:18.047 --> 03:13:20.730
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Just turned to mush.

4407
03:13:20.730 --> 03:13:22.347
LAURA: Sorry.

4408
03:13:22.347 --> 03:13:23.380
MATT: Do you have another attack or just the one?

4409
03:13:23.380 --> 03:13:25.840
LAURA: I think it's just the one.
MATT: All righty.

4410
03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:26.910
You move over towards the other one,

4411
03:13:26.910 --> 03:13:28.390
just trumpet loudly.

4412
03:13:28.390 --> 03:13:30.820
You see, in the distance, other movement.

4413
03:13:30.820 --> 03:13:32.240
SAM: Oh no.
MARISHA: What the fuck?

4414
03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:34.037
MATT: That is scattering further away.

4415
03:13:34.037 --> 03:13:35.021
(relieved groans)

4416
03:13:35.021 --> 03:13:37.442
They are not enjoying the presence of

4417
03:13:37.442 --> 03:13:40.142
a fucking mammoth in the middle of the jungle.

4418
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:45.920
So finishing your go, Jester, that brings us to Caduceus.

4419
03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:48.100
TALIESIN: There's one left?
MATT: There's one left.

4420
03:13:48.100 --> 03:13:49.350
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame.

4421
03:13:49.350 --> 03:13:50.470
Not even going to move, just--

4422
03:13:50.470 --> 03:13:54.070
LAURA: It's almost dead.
MATT: That a dexterity save?

4423
03:13:54.070 --> 03:13:56.570
TALIESIN: It's a, yeah, I believe so.

4424
03:13:56.570 --> 03:13:58.320
MATT: 17. What's your DC?
TALIESIN: 17.

4425
03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:01.507
MATT: It just succeeds, I'm sorry.
TALIESIN: Bugger.

4426
03:14:03.496 --> 03:14:06.296
MATT: They got a high dex. All right, that finishes your go?

4427
03:14:06.296 --> 03:14:08.110
Or are you going to--
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4428
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:10.530
I'm going to sit there being irritated.

4429
03:14:10.530 --> 03:14:11.363
MATT: Okay, got it.

4430
03:14:11.363 --> 03:14:13.380
Beau, you're up.
MARISHA: Oh.

4431
03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:14.900
MATT: There's a giant gorilla to one side

4432
03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:15.910
and a wooly mammoth to the other

4433
03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:17.780
and one heavily damaged bug in between the two of them.

4434
03:14:17.780 --> 03:14:19.250
It's skittering through their legs,

4435
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:21.590
trying to not get smashed and you're just watching this.

4436
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:23.250
MARISHA: Is he the only one?
MATT: Yeah.

4437
03:14:23.250 --> 03:14:25.180
MARISHA: The only bug?
MATT: The only bug left.

4438
03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:27.155
SAM: Maybe we can befriend it.

4439
03:14:27.155 --> 03:14:28.855
LIAM: Is this another bug hunt, sir?

4440
03:14:30.180 --> 03:14:33.390
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm just going to dodge the mammoth feet

4441
03:14:33.390 --> 03:14:36.010
and the gorilla feet and just once again

4442
03:14:36.010 --> 03:14:37.838
take my staff and just like--

4443
03:14:39.871 --> 03:14:41.510
MATT: Just Whac-A-Mole it?
MARISHA: Kind of Whac-A-Mole it.

4444
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:43.483
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine, pop pop.

4445
03:14:43.483 --> 03:14:46.580
LIAM: Shake Weight, Shake Weight.
MARISHA: Shake Weight it.

4446
03:14:46.580 --> 03:14:49.510
An 18 for a 28 and a natural 20.

4447
03:14:49.510 --> 03:14:53.200
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.
MARISHA: For the 18?

4448
03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:55.990
Yeah, shit, eight.

4449
03:14:55.990 --> 03:14:57.190
For the natural 20?

4450
03:14:58.257 --> 03:14:59.765
That's okay, 16.

4451
03:14:59.765 --> 03:15:00.873
MATT: How do you want to do this?

4452
03:15:00.873 --> 03:15:02.835
(cheering)

4453
03:15:03.726 --> 03:15:07.620
MARISHA: Oh goodness, what do I do with a bug?

4454
03:15:07.620 --> 03:15:10.620
You know, I'm just going to, I'm just going to,

4455
03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:13.200
I was churning butter, I'm just going to keep

4456
03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:16.080
churning that butter, you know, and just going to--

4457
03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:18.890
MARISHA: It's rushing around, it's escaping through

4458
03:15:18.890 --> 03:15:21.480
the mammoth's legs and the monkey goes and slams

4459
03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:22.920
towards the ground and it just avoids it--

4460
03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:24.060
LAURA: Stop, Beau.
MATT: You rush forward

4461
03:15:24.060 --> 03:15:26.740
and take the-- yeah, don't, you're--

4462
03:15:26.740 --> 03:15:30.018
LIAM: That's okay, that's okay, that's okay.

4463
03:15:30.018 --> 03:15:32.470
MATT: Learn from Sam's gif mistakes last campaign.

4464
03:15:32.470 --> 03:15:34.055
LAURA: No, stop, stop!

4465
03:15:34.055 --> 03:15:35.612
(laughter)

4466
03:15:35.612 --> 03:15:37.362
MATT: You watch and wait for a moment and you take your

4467
03:15:37.362 --> 03:15:40.390
staff and just pin it to the ground and it can't move.

4468
03:15:40.390 --> 03:15:42.480
As it's there, you just lean

4469
03:15:42.480 --> 03:15:44.880
your weight into it and something snaps.

4470
03:15:44.880 --> 03:15:47.000
It pushes through the armor and it just goes (squeaks)

4471
03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.167
limp on the ground, no longer moving.

4472
03:15:50.100 --> 03:15:52.355
MARISHA: Yeah, it's dead.
TRAVIS: Nice.

4473
03:15:52.355 --> 03:15:54.273
(laughter)

4474
03:15:54.273 --> 03:15:56.760
MATT: All righty.
SAM: Wow.

4475
03:15:56.760 --> 03:15:58.810
TRAVIS: Before I un-restrain myself,

4476
03:15:58.810 --> 03:16:02.170
I feel like we should pass these out.

4477
03:16:02.170 --> 03:16:04.198
SAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Who wants a healing potion?

4478
03:16:04.198 --> 03:16:05.358
MARISHA: I'll take one.
SAM: I'll take one.

4479
03:16:05.358 --> 03:16:07.258
TRAVIS: Okay. Who wants the big one?

4480
03:16:07.258 --> 03:16:08.460
SAM: Caleb.

4481
03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:13.126
TRAVIS: There you go.
Ah! I'll hold the monkey's for a minute.

4482
03:16:13.126 --> 03:16:14.392
TALIESIN: If everybody likes,

4483
03:16:14.392 --> 03:16:17.630
I can take 10 minutes and just help everybody out.

4484
03:16:17.630 --> 03:16:19.160
Or at least a few of us out.

4485
03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:20.755
SAM: Yashies?
ASHLEY: I'm okay.

4486
03:16:20.755 --> 03:16:22.818
LAURA: Yeah, I'll--
TALIESIN: I'll--

4487
03:16:22.818 --> 03:16:25.251
TALIESIN: You take one.
LAURA: I guess I'll drop my

4488
03:16:25.251 --> 03:16:27.481
Polymorph.
SAM: Beau-y?

4489
03:16:27.481 --> 03:16:29.340
LAURA: It lasts for an hour.

4490
03:16:29.340 --> 03:16:32.540
SAM: Wait, wait, Caleb comes up to-- Capeleb comes up to

4491
03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:34.750
the mammoth and just sort of like you're petting a horse

4492
03:16:34.750 --> 03:16:39.750
only (pants) and then swings up
and plants himself up on top.

4493
03:16:40.146 --> 03:16:41.496
LAURA: You're pretty big.

4494
03:16:42.850 --> 03:16:45.140
You're going to ride on top of the mammoth?

4495
03:16:46.676 --> 03:16:48.561
MATT: Are you staying a mammoth?

4496
03:16:48.561 --> 03:16:50.691
LIAM: (panting)
LAURA: (trumpeting)

4497
03:16:50.691 --> 03:16:54.193
No, I drop my form.

4498
03:16:54.193 --> 03:16:56.180
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: Okay,

4499
03:16:56.180 --> 03:16:58.930
make a dexterity saving throw.

4500
03:16:58.930 --> 03:17:00.413
SAM: Insta-death.
TALIESIN: Oh!

4501
03:17:01.998 --> 03:17:02.831
LAURA: Ooh.

4502
03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:09.510
LIAM: Can I try to plant two feet and not squish?

4503
03:17:09.550 --> 03:17:12.910
MATT: If she didn't roll a one, I'd say yes.

4504
03:17:14.550 --> 03:17:19.020
So as you leap onto the mammoth, it instantly shrinks,

4505
03:17:19.020 --> 03:17:21.580
like instantly (shrinking) and there's a moment,

4506
03:17:21.580 --> 03:17:23.530
in a very cartoon physics way, where you're just

4507
03:17:23.530 --> 03:17:26.502
suspended about 10 feet in the air before

4508
03:17:26.502 --> 03:17:31.502
(crashing) and you, like, "Shit!" and then (slam).

4509
03:17:31.930 --> 03:17:34.120
Go ahead and roll 2d6 for me, Caleb.

4510
03:17:34.120 --> 03:17:36.520
TRAVIS: Inside the gorilla's erection.

4511
03:17:36.520 --> 03:17:37.600
LIAM: Six.
MATT: You take

4512
03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:39.140
six points of bludgeoning damage

4513
03:17:39.140 --> 03:17:41.251
and are pinned beneath a giant gorilla.

4514
03:17:41.251 --> 03:17:43.290
LIAM: (panting)
LAURA: (groaning)

4515
03:17:43.290 --> 03:17:45.000
LIAM: Stands up and grabs her by the ankle.

4516
03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:46.339
LAURA: Ow!

4517
03:17:46.339 --> 03:17:48.089
(laughter)

4518
03:17:48.089 --> 03:17:49.696
MARISHA: Capeleb!
LAURA: Caleb!

4519
03:17:49.696 --> 03:17:51.012
SAM: Capeleb.
LAURA: Caleb.

4520
03:17:51.012 --> 03:17:52.426
MARISHA: Let her go!

4521
03:17:52.426 --> 03:17:54.676
LIAM: (groaning)

4522
03:17:55.561 --> 03:17:56.394
LAURA: Oh man.

4523
03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:00.760
SAM: I'm going to run over to Yasha and--

4524
03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:01.780
LAURA: I got to heal.

4525
03:18:01.780 --> 03:18:04.530
SAM: Try to get my flask out of her.

4526
03:18:04.530 --> 03:18:06.800
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Going to try to

4527
03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:08.370
swipe my flask back.
ASHLEY: You're going to try

4528
03:18:08.370 --> 03:18:09.270
to swipe it, you're not even going to,

4529
03:18:09.270 --> 03:18:11.590
you're going to try to sneak it?
SAM: I'm going to try to sneak it.

4530
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:12.430
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right,

4531
03:18:12.430 --> 03:18:14.950
go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

4532
03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:17.280
SAM: Disadvantage.
MATT: Make a perception check.

4533
03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:22.660
MARISHA: C'mon, Yash.
ASHLEY: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

4534
03:18:22.660 --> 03:18:25.117
SAM: Disadvantage.
LAURA: Oh, never mind.

4535
03:18:25.117 --> 03:18:26.292
MARISHA: Hey!

4536
03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:30.412
What? What?
TALIESIN: I'm doing everyone but you.

4537
03:18:30.412 --> 03:18:31.720
ASHLEY: What'd you roll?

4538
03:18:31.720 --> 03:18:34.011
SAM: Technically, it's a 23.

4539
03:18:34.011 --> 03:18:36.690
MATT: Yeah, with Reliable Talent.
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural 20.

4540
03:18:36.690 --> 03:18:38.780
ALL: Oh!
MATT: What's the total on it?

4541
03:18:38.780 --> 03:18:40.169
ASHLEY: What's the total? 23.

4542
03:18:40.169 --> 03:18:41.751
MARISHA: (gasping)

4543
03:18:41.751 --> 03:18:45.880
MATT: Holy shit, you actually catch Nott!

4544
03:18:45.880 --> 03:18:47.450
You like, after everyone's taken a moment,

4545
03:18:47.450 --> 03:18:48.540
and you're like, the blood's on you

4546
03:18:48.540 --> 03:18:50.320
and you're wiping it a bit and you walk over

4547
03:18:50.320 --> 03:18:53.660
and you just take, everyone's settling down for a minute

4548
03:18:53.660 --> 03:18:55.650
and you feel this tug and you glance behind you

4549
03:18:55.650 --> 03:18:57.570
and Nott is pulling the flask--

4550
03:18:57.570 --> 03:18:59.820
ASHLEY: I'm just going to slap her without even looking.

4551
03:18:59.820 --> 03:19:01.901
MATT: Tsh.
SAM: Ah!

4552
03:19:01.901 --> 03:19:03.045
ASHLEY: What are you doing?!

4553
03:19:03.045 --> 03:19:04.960
SAM: (yelling)

4554
03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:06.810
TALIESIN: 28.
SAM: I couldn't-- I can't

4555
03:19:06.810 --> 03:19:09.270
shoot straight without the booze.

4556
03:19:09.270 --> 03:19:11.811
I wasn't shooting straight.

4557
03:19:11.811 --> 03:19:13.177
ASHLEY: What are you talking about?

4558
03:19:13.177 --> 03:19:16.000
You shot just fine.
SAM: No, I missed twice.

4559
03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:18.240
LAURA: It's true, I saw her shoot herself in the eyeball.

4560
03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:20.310
SAM: I shot myself in the eyeball.

4561
03:19:20.310 --> 03:19:21.910
ASHLEY: <i>You</i> gave me this flask.

4562
03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:25.100
Do you really want me to keep it or do you want to take it?

4563
03:19:25.100 --> 03:19:27.420
SAM: I don't know anymore.
LAURA: Don't take it, Nott.

4564
03:19:27.420 --> 03:19:29.195
ASHLEY: I'll hold on to it for, let's--

4565
03:19:29.195 --> 03:19:30.429
how about I hold on to it

4566
03:19:30.429 --> 03:19:35.084
until we get to Caduceus' destination?

4567
03:19:35.930 --> 03:19:36.990
SAM: All right.

4568
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:39.556
TRAVIS: Can I try to un-restrain myself, please?

4569
03:19:39.556 --> 03:19:42.372
MATT: Yes. After a moment, you manage to pull free of

4570
03:19:42.372 --> 03:19:45.916
the hardened, wax-like cocoon substance.

4571
03:19:45.916 --> 03:19:47.116
TRAVIS: There's so much happening right now.

4572
03:19:47.116 --> 03:19:48.616
MARISHA: No, don't help him, don't help him.

4573
03:19:48.616 --> 03:19:50.270
(laughter)

4574
03:19:50.270 --> 03:19:51.950
TALIESIN: Have I done a Prayer of Healing by this point?

4575
03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:53.010
MATT: That takes how long to cast?

4576
03:19:53.010 --> 03:19:54.530
TALIESIN: 10 minutes.
MATT: 10 minutes?

4577
03:19:54.530 --> 03:19:56.100
If you guys are taking 10 minutes here,

4578
03:19:56.100 --> 03:19:57.480
then yeah, you can go ahead and cast it.

4579
03:19:57.480 --> 03:19:59.834
TALIESIN: Everybody except for Caleb,
because you're still a monkey--

4580
03:19:59.834 --> 03:20:02.100
LAURA: Are we going to take a short rest?

4581
03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:03.950
TALIESIN: No, just a 10 minute, just to--

4582
03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:05.150
You're still a monkey, so I'm not healing you.

4583
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:06.680
MATT: You can take a short rest if you want to.

4584
03:20:06.680 --> 03:20:08.910
LAURA: Let's take a short rest.
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

4585
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:11.350
TALIESIN: Gets 26 points of healing.
MATT: So everyone except for

4586
03:20:11.350 --> 03:20:13.940
Caleb, unless you want to drop your monkey form.

4587
03:20:13.940 --> 03:20:16.100
Caleb.
LIAM: I'm deciding that now.

4588
03:20:16.100 --> 03:20:17.830
MATT: Because either you can keep it--

4589
03:20:17.830 --> 03:20:19.740
LIAM: Because I'm fucked up, Caleb is fucked up,

4590
03:20:19.740 --> 03:20:21.770
but monkey is not.
TALIESIN: I was going to say.

4591
03:20:21.770 --> 03:20:22.940
Because if you drop it, then I'll just--

4592
03:20:22.940 --> 03:20:23.940
MATT: How long does the monkey last?

4593
03:20:23.940 --> 03:20:25.140
LIAM: Just an hour, so I got to drop it.

4594
03:20:25.140 --> 03:20:26.280
MATT: So if you're taking a short rest,

4595
03:20:26.280 --> 03:20:27.188
you might as well.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I might as well.

4596
03:20:27.188 --> 03:20:29.000
MATT: All right, so you can take the healing.

4597
03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:32.520
SAM: Do we all get healing?
TALIESIN: No, we can only use six, so.

4598
03:20:32.520 --> 03:20:34.080
ASHLEY: I don't need it.
SAM: I don't need it.

4599
03:20:34.080 --> 03:20:36.450
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Who doesn't need it more?

4600
03:20:36.450 --> 03:20:37.283
SAM: I don't need it.

4601
03:20:37.283 --> 03:20:38.116
TALIESIN: Oh, he doesn't need it at all, so.

4602
03:20:38.116 --> 03:20:39.790
Sam doesn't need it, so.

4603
03:20:39.790 --> 03:20:44.180
SAM: The only damage I took was
self-inflicted six points of damage.

4604
03:20:44.180 --> 03:20:45.600
MATT: That's true.

4605
03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:48.560
Short rest.
TALIESIN: Did Nott handle poison--

4606
03:20:48.560 --> 03:20:49.460
MATT: You're still poisoned, yeah.

4607
03:20:49.460 --> 03:20:51.856
TALIESIN: Oh, I think I can do something about that, too.

4608
03:20:51.856 --> 03:20:53.979
MATT: Okay, so you guys can use your hit die to go ahead

4609
03:20:53.979 --> 03:20:56.540
and heal up naturally during the short rest, if you'd like.

4610
03:20:56.540 --> 03:20:58.170
TALIESIN: Oh, then, I already did it--

4611
03:20:58.170 --> 03:20:59.620
LAURA: I know.
TALIESIN: I don't care.

4612
03:20:59.620 --> 03:21:02.305
MATT: You've already cast the spell, it's fine.

4613
03:21:03.780 --> 03:21:06.890
TALIESIN: What fixes poison?

4614
03:21:06.890 --> 03:21:08.507
MATT: Lesser Restoration.

4615
03:21:08.507 --> 03:21:10.800
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you a quick Lesser Restoration.

4616
03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:13.183
Anybody else poisoned?

4617
03:21:13.183 --> 03:21:15.000
MATT: I don't think so. The only other person who was

4618
03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.650
in danger of it is immune because monks.

4619
03:21:17.650 --> 03:21:19.840
TALIESIN: So no more poison.
SAM: Thank you.

4620
03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:22.355
TALIESIN: Oh, it's no problem, you're welcome.

4621
03:21:23.230 --> 03:21:24.063
MATT: All right.

4622
03:21:24.983 --> 03:21:28.395
TRAVIS: I love this map. Can we build a house here?

4623
03:21:28.395 --> 03:21:30.860
MATT: If you want to.

4624
03:21:30.860 --> 03:21:33.120
TRAVIS: Just a latticework of bridges.

4625
03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:35.205
Swiss Family Robinson--

4626
03:21:35.205 --> 03:21:37.800
MATT: So the creatures are scattered about.

4627
03:21:37.800 --> 03:21:40.060
Broken, sliced, pulled apart,

4628
03:21:40.060 --> 03:21:43.680
the purple ichor scattered across the jungle floor.

4629
03:21:43.680 --> 03:21:46.660
The large broken tree that's now on its side,

4630
03:21:46.660 --> 03:21:49.660
the dust settled that was kicked up from its impact.

4631
03:21:49.660 --> 03:21:52.090
TALIESIN: Well, that was a valuable lesson.

4632
03:21:52.090 --> 03:21:53.900
SAM: What was that lesson?

4633
03:21:55.090 --> 03:21:58.132
TALIESIN: Don't poke big things
if you don't know what they are.

4634
03:21:59.899 --> 03:22:02.090
TRAVIS: I don't know if I've learned that lesson.

4635
03:22:02.090 --> 03:22:02.923
TALIESIN: I know.

4636
03:22:05.170 --> 03:22:08.540
TRAVIS: Which, in the heyday,
what direction were we heading?

4637
03:22:08.540 --> 03:22:09.990
TALIESIN: That way.

4638
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:11.247
That way.

4639
03:22:11.247 --> 03:22:13.086
(laughter)

4640
03:22:13.086 --> 03:22:13.927
LIAM: Caleb remembers.

4641
03:22:13.927 --> 03:22:15.645
MATT: Yeah, you guys know the direction you were traveling.

4642
03:22:17.930 --> 03:22:19.450
TRAVIS: Do we need to rest for a moment?

4643
03:22:19.450 --> 03:22:21.510
Are we good to--
MATT: You just took a short rest.

4644
03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:24.460
So about an hour of downtime to--

4645
03:22:24.460 --> 03:22:26.828
MARISHA: Nailed it.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

4646
03:22:26.828 --> 03:22:28.108
MATT: Gathering your shit.

4647
03:22:29.492 --> 03:22:31.370
Is there anything you want to do during the short rest?

4648
03:22:31.370 --> 03:22:35.530
LAURA: I will carve a little dick into the tree

4649
03:22:35.530 --> 03:22:37.320
that I knocked over as a mammoth.

4650
03:22:37.320 --> 03:22:39.200
MATT: You got it.

4651
03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:41.770
This one equal, if not better, than the one

4652
03:22:41.770 --> 03:22:44.618
you left earlier in the jungle.

4653
03:22:44.618 --> 03:22:46.200
You're getting good at these dicks.

4654
03:22:46.200 --> 03:22:47.033
LAURA: You know.

4655
03:22:47.870 --> 03:22:49.410
LIAM: Caleb'll use Arcane Recovery.

4656
03:22:49.410 --> 03:22:51.160
MATT: Okay, so you get your spell back.

4657
03:22:53.170 --> 03:22:54.220
All righty.

4658
03:22:54.220 --> 03:22:56.000
After taking an hour of downtime

4659
03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:58.150
to rest up and sit and

4660
03:22:59.670 --> 03:23:02.630
think about whatever the hell you're doing

4661
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:04.270
in the middle of this weird expanse

4662
03:23:04.270 --> 03:23:06.870
and these creatures you stumbled past,

4663
03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:08.380
what do you guys want to do?

4664
03:23:08.380 --> 03:23:11.250
TALIESIN: I'm done meditating, I'm ready to move on.

4665
03:23:11.250 --> 03:23:13.940
SAM: We could meditate.
TALIESIN: We just did.

4666
03:23:13.940 --> 03:23:15.901
LAURA: We just took, like, an hour, so.

4667
03:23:15.901 --> 03:23:17.750
MATT: Can make a meditation part of the short rest that--

4668
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:20.090
MARISHA: Do you want to meditate?

4669
03:23:20.090 --> 03:23:22.790
SAM: I'd like to meditate.
LAURA: Oh, that's great.

4670
03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:27.626
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll join in a meditation.

4671
03:23:27.626 --> 03:23:28.668
MATT: Okay.

4672
03:23:28.668 --> 03:23:29.501
SAM: Om.

4673
03:23:31.870 --> 03:23:33.380
Om.

4674
03:23:33.380 --> 03:23:34.860
MARISHA: Don't, you don't have to do that.

4675
03:23:34.860 --> 03:23:35.693
SAM: Om!

4676
03:23:35.693 --> 03:23:38.505
MARISHA: No no no, just listen to the environment.

4677
03:23:38.505 --> 03:23:40.990
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Let it flow through you.

4678
03:23:40.990 --> 03:23:41.875
SAM: Oh.

4679
03:23:41.875 --> 03:23:43.437
MARISHA: Yes.
SAM: You're joining us?

4680
03:23:43.437 --> 03:23:46.075
TRAVIS: Well, yeah.
SAM: All right.

4681
03:23:47.222 --> 03:23:48.394
TRAVIS: (deep breathing)

4682
03:23:48.394 --> 03:23:53.130
MATT: So here recovering, sore,

4683
03:23:53.130 --> 03:23:55.420
you all slowly make your way through

4684
03:23:55.420 --> 03:23:57.900
an impromptu guided meditation for the better part

4685
03:23:57.900 --> 03:24:00.816
of an hour in the middle of the jungle

4686
03:24:00.816 --> 03:24:04.158
on the outskirts of the Whitedawn Lagoon.

4687
03:24:04.158 --> 03:24:06.740
LAURA: I'm just going to dance around while I'm meditating.

4688
03:24:06.740 --> 03:24:08.663
MATT: That is a form of meditation for some.

4689
03:24:08.663 --> 03:24:10.590
Dance therapy.
LIAM: Frumpkin is

4690
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:13.830
picking nits out of Fjord's hair as he meditates.

4691
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:17.170
MATT: You got it.
LIAM: All the nits, so many nits.

4692
03:24:17.170 --> 03:24:18.560
MATT: It's a lot of nits.

4693
03:24:18.560 --> 03:24:19.970
All righty, as the rest is done,

4694
03:24:19.970 --> 03:24:21.720
you guys continue in the direction.

4695
03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:24.817
TALIESIN: Get up and we move.
MATT: Okay, same,

4696
03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:28.870
same order?
MARISHA: Sure.

4697
03:24:28.870 --> 03:24:30.030
MATT: As before?
MARISHA: Yeah.

4698
03:24:30.030 --> 03:24:32.019
LAURA: Oy vey.

4699
03:24:32.019 --> 03:24:33.915
MATT: Caduceus and Fjord at the front,

4700
03:24:35.214 --> 03:24:39.240
Beau and was it Caleb?

4701
03:24:39.240 --> 03:24:41.670
LAURA: Was that clean dirt insect poop?

4702
03:24:43.220 --> 03:24:44.420
MATT: You don't know.

4703
03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:47.540
You can inspect the insects or inspect the space around it

4704
03:24:47.540 --> 03:24:49.100
if you wanted to try and figure it out.

4705
03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:50.470
TRAVIS: Do you want to look inside one of

4706
03:24:50.470 --> 03:24:54.420
the opened up pale scorpion things?

4707
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:58.120
Simple biology, just take a look.

4708
03:24:58.120 --> 03:24:59.370
LAURA: At their poop?
TRAVIS: Yeah,

4709
03:24:59.370 --> 03:25:01.470
just open up the guts, look in the stomach sac.

4710
03:25:01.470 --> 03:25:03.120
TALIESIN: They probably have poison sacs.

4711
03:25:04.047 --> 03:25:05.263
LAURA: Ooh!

4712
03:25:05.263 --> 03:25:07.030
Nott, you should take some of those poison sacs

4713
03:25:07.030 --> 03:25:08.770
inside of them.
AM: They do? Okay.

4714
03:25:08.770 --> 03:25:10.170
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to help get those out

4715
03:25:10.170 --> 03:25:12.060
because I'm good at medicine.

4716
03:25:12.060 --> 03:25:14.625
SAM: Oh, all right.
MATT: Okay.

4717
03:25:16.090 --> 03:25:19.450
Go ahead and roll a medicine and a nature check.

4718
03:25:19.450 --> 03:25:21.209
LAURA: Both of them?
MATT: Yes.

4719
03:25:23.820 --> 03:25:26.000
LAURA: Medicine, 27.

4720
03:25:27.400 --> 03:25:28.233
Nature,

4721
03:25:31.610 --> 03:25:32.520
12.

4722
03:25:33.530 --> 03:25:35.150
MATT: Okay.

4723
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:36.930
You have no idea if these creatures are

4724
03:25:36.930 --> 03:25:39.400
indigenous to here or not, they're odd.

4725
03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:42.083
The one thing that catches your eye is

4726
03:25:42.083 --> 03:25:44.490
their coloration and physicality

4727
03:25:44.490 --> 03:25:48.567
doesn't seem to fit this environment.

4728
03:25:48.567 --> 03:25:50.520
It doesn't make sense for a creature like this

4729
03:25:50.520 --> 03:25:52.983
to live in a dense part of a jungle.

4730
03:25:54.340 --> 03:25:55.830
With your medicine check, you do find that

4731
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:58.590
there are actually two glands on the inside of its body,

4732
03:25:58.590 --> 03:26:01.990
separate chemicals, that, when combined,

4733
03:26:01.990 --> 03:26:05.440
create that caustic, wax-like substance.

4734
03:26:05.440 --> 03:26:08.380
Separately, they're just--
TALIESIN: Inert.

4735
03:26:08.380 --> 03:26:11.540
MATT: Yeah, inert, nasty, viscous, oil-like liquids.

4736
03:26:11.540 --> 03:26:15.230
One's a deep bluish color, the other one is clear.

4737
03:26:15.230 --> 03:26:16.490
When they're put together, it becomes

4738
03:26:16.490 --> 03:26:18.710
like a white foam that then

4739
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:21.950
burns and solidifies into this cocoon-like wax.

4740
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:24.180
LAURA: I'm going to get them in vials.
MATT: Okay.

4741
03:26:24.180 --> 03:26:27.820
You have enough for probably one application.

4742
03:26:27.820 --> 03:26:29.540
SAM: It's acute?
MATT: Kind of, yeah,

4743
03:26:29.540 --> 03:26:31.892
and when I say, it foams up.

4744
03:26:31.892 --> 03:26:33.680
Both of them combined can probably affect--

4745
03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:35.530
LAURA: Acidic wax.
MATT: Acidic wax,

4746
03:26:35.530 --> 03:26:38.160
you could say, compound, acidic wax compound.

4747
03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:39.680
LIAM: That's some good pranking there.

4748
03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:40.980
LAURA: Well, I gave it to Nott.

4749
03:26:42.477 --> 03:26:45.300
But there's plenty of other ones.

4750
03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:48.193
MATT: If you want to try it again.
LAURA: Yeah!

4751
03:26:48.193 --> 03:26:50.602
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll another medicine check.

4752
03:26:50.602 --> 03:26:54.473
LAURA: That didn't count, that slipped out of my hand.

4753
03:26:54.473 --> 03:26:56.200
LIAM: That's kind of what you do with a die.

4754
03:26:56.200 --> 03:26:57.470
LAURA: No, but you know what I mean.

4755
03:26:57.470 --> 03:26:59.120
It has to be an intentional roll.

4756
03:27:00.060 --> 03:27:01.898
20.
MATT: 20?

4757
03:27:02.928 --> 03:27:05.635
MARISHA: (laughter)

4758
03:27:05.635 --> 03:27:07.660
LAURA: You know what I mean!

4759
03:27:07.660 --> 03:27:09.760
MATT: I'll say you just barely manage

4760
03:27:09.760 --> 03:27:12.240
to pull another set of these glands

4761
03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:13.820
from one of the other corpses

4762
03:27:13.820 --> 03:27:15.700
without them accidentally touching

4763
03:27:15.700 --> 03:27:17.550
and combining and setting off a reaction.

4764
03:27:17.550 --> 03:27:19.490
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: A lot of these bodies

4765
03:27:19.490 --> 03:27:20.950
have been damaged heavily from the battle

4766
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:23.620
and there's only maybe one or two others

4767
03:27:23.620 --> 03:27:27.710
that even are viably intact to withdraw from,

4768
03:27:27.710 --> 03:27:31.510
but you barely succeeded in not hurting yourself

4769
03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:33.457
in this process.
LAURA: Okay. That's all, I'm done.

4770
03:27:33.457 --> 03:27:34.290
MATT: Okay.

4771
03:27:35.780 --> 03:27:37.860
TRAVIS: We're off?
TALIESIN: We're off.

4772
03:27:37.860 --> 03:27:39.060
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Lead the way.

4773
03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:44.500
MATT: You push closer to the center of this jungle region

4774
03:27:44.500 --> 03:27:48.070
for the next couple hours or so.

4775
03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:51.730
Those patches of wax and discolored fungus

4776
03:27:51.730 --> 03:27:55.340
begin to fade as you move on, apparently moving past

4777
03:27:55.340 --> 03:27:59.703
the region that nested these creatures at the moment,

4778
03:27:59.703 --> 03:28:03.660
but you do occasionally still come across, rarely,

4779
03:28:03.660 --> 03:28:07.680
another pile of fresh, clean

4780
03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:11.140
moved earth, vibrant red,

4781
03:28:11.140 --> 03:28:12.990
standing out against the environment.

4782
03:28:15.750 --> 03:28:20.750
Eventually, as the sky begin to turn slightly orange

4783
03:28:20.950 --> 03:28:23.630
as the day begins to progress a little later on,

4784
03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:27.580
as the hours continue by, you can see

4785
03:28:27.580 --> 03:28:31.030
just the faint hint of light refracting off of

4786
03:28:32.620 --> 03:28:34.867
a mirror? Water.

4787
03:28:37.710 --> 03:28:39.480
And the patches of jungle

4788
03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:42.330
and the elements of faint fungus that remain begin to

4789
03:28:42.330 --> 03:28:45.796
give way to a clearing

4790
03:28:45.796 --> 03:28:48.162
that houses a small lake.

4791
03:28:50.133 --> 03:28:54.540
An oasis pool, if you will, of extremely clear water

4792
03:28:54.540 --> 03:28:58.490
that's fostering all manner of fish under the surface.

4793
03:28:59.690 --> 03:29:03.570
The thin shore is dotted with rocks,

4794
03:29:03.570 --> 03:29:07.630
scattered brush atop the rich, red earth that is exposed,

4795
03:29:07.630 --> 03:29:10.190
very much like what you encountered before,

4796
03:29:10.190 --> 03:29:12.720
but without the heavy roots and jungle undergrowth,

4797
03:29:12.720 --> 03:29:14.080
it is just a bright red shore

4798
03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:15.630
along the outside of this lake.

4799
03:29:16.970 --> 03:29:20.930
Beautiful rock carvings of various animals and creatures

4800
03:29:20.930 --> 03:29:24.224
align the edges of this lake

4801
03:29:24.224 --> 03:29:27.060
like a statue garden

4802
03:29:27.060 --> 03:29:30.760
of all these beautiful beasts and people just,

4803
03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:34.095
in this decorative sense, surrounding this lake.

4804
03:29:35.078 --> 03:29:37.770
A menagerie of beautiful art

4805
03:29:37.770 --> 03:29:41.400
enshrining this space as the Court of Beasts.

4806
03:29:41.400 --> 03:29:44.610
Jungle deer, bears, other jungle cats,

4807
03:29:44.610 --> 03:29:46.360
massive lizards, all sorts of creatures,

4808
03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:49.478
all immortalized in these sculptures.

4809
03:29:51.850 --> 03:29:53.810
LAURA: Does it look like they're actually sculptures

4810
03:29:53.810 --> 03:29:55.120
or do they look like creatures

4811
03:29:55.120 --> 03:29:57.460
that have been turned to stone?

4812
03:29:57.460 --> 03:29:59.580
MATT: You can walk up to one if you want to inspect.

4813
03:29:59.580 --> 03:30:01.913
Make an investigation check.

4814
03:30:06.793 --> 03:30:08.668
LAURA: What a pretty statue.
MATT: Natural one?

4815
03:30:09.760 --> 03:30:11.350
It looks like a pretty well-carved statue,

4816
03:30:11.350 --> 03:30:13.567
you can't really tell.

4817
03:30:15.011 --> 03:30:17.380
But you do, as you guys walk toward the edge of

4818
03:30:17.380 --> 03:30:20.220
the treeline here, you can see along the western bank--

4819
03:30:20.220 --> 03:30:22.360
which is not entirely on the opposite side,

4820
03:30:22.360 --> 03:30:23.970
but a little further away around

4821
03:30:23.970 --> 03:30:26.246
the northern curvature of the lakeside--

4822
03:30:26.246 --> 03:30:28.558
you can see a few odd, broken, heavy rocks

4823
03:30:28.558 --> 03:30:31.620
that push away from the rest of

4824
03:30:31.620 --> 03:30:33.910
the smooth edges of the water,

4825
03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:38.270
like a hillside with red rock that has emerged.

4826
03:30:38.270 --> 03:30:39.310
You can see

4827
03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:46.400
scattered slivers of well-carved statues

4828
03:30:46.400 --> 03:30:48.950
that sit around an entrance of a cave

4829
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:50.600
like a cathedral entrance with

4830
03:30:50.600 --> 03:30:53.590
these statues set to walk through and into.

4831
03:30:57.290 --> 03:31:01.940
This raised bank is the mouth of a cavern

4832
03:31:01.940 --> 03:31:06.690
that, just beyond where the water is, in the shadow,

4833
03:31:06.690 --> 03:31:09.510
descends deep into the earth on that side.

4834
03:31:11.918 --> 03:31:14.190
What would you guys like to do?

4835
03:31:14.190 --> 03:31:15.700
LAURA: What do we do?
SAM: Is this the place?

4836
03:31:15.700 --> 03:31:19.840
TALIESIN: I'm going to touch the water, smell it.

4837
03:31:19.840 --> 03:31:21.340
MATT: It's very clear, very clean.

4838
03:31:23.690 --> 03:31:26.210
TALIESIN: Well, let's go.
TRAVIS: In the water?

4839
03:31:26.210 --> 03:31:27.043
TALIESIN: No.

4840
03:31:28.340 --> 03:31:29.771
No, not yet.

4841
03:31:29.771 --> 03:31:33.300
We're going to go to the cave.
MARISHA: Not yet?

4842
03:31:33.300 --> 03:31:35.803
LAURA: Splash splash splash splash splash splash.

4843
03:31:35.803 --> 03:31:38.870
MATT: (laughs) The fish scatter.

4844
03:31:39.970 --> 03:31:42.340
LAURA: It's really pretty water, though, hm?

4845
03:31:42.340 --> 03:31:43.300
TALIESIN: It's beautiful.

4846
03:31:43.300 --> 03:31:44.750
TRAVIS: We could always check the water.

4847
03:31:45.740 --> 03:31:46.573
SAM: For traps?

4848
03:31:47.577 --> 03:31:50.740
TRAVIS: I could just walk down there and see what's--

4849
03:31:50.740 --> 03:31:52.090
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm at the water.

4850
03:31:53.330 --> 03:31:56.278
TRAVIS: I actually meant down there.

4851
03:31:56.278 --> 03:31:58.173
TALIESIN: I don't think there's anything down there.

4852
03:31:59.640 --> 03:32:01.090
MATT: Up to you.
LAURA: Can you see?

4853
03:32:01.090 --> 03:32:02.270
Can we see the bottom?

4854
03:32:02.270 --> 03:32:04.170
It's real clear.
MATT: Make a perception check.

4855
03:32:04.170 --> 03:32:05.003
TALIESIN: I'll join you in that.

4856
03:32:05.003 --> 03:32:08.580
MATT: The two of you can do that individually.

4857
03:32:08.580 --> 03:32:10.880
TALIESIN: 18.

4858
03:32:10.880 --> 03:32:12.213
MATT: That's cocked.

4859
03:32:17.270 --> 03:32:18.103
TALIESIN: Fair.

4860
03:32:20.260 --> 03:32:21.930
LAURA: 17.
MATT: Okay.

4861
03:32:21.930 --> 03:32:22.763
It is very clear.

4862
03:32:22.763 --> 03:32:24.050
You can't make out a lot of detail

4863
03:32:24.050 --> 03:32:26.070
with just the light that's refracting off the surface,

4864
03:32:26.070 --> 03:32:30.870
but you can see there is a beautiful little forest of

4865
03:32:33.790 --> 03:32:38.340
lake plants and just little life ecosystems beneath,

4866
03:32:38.340 --> 03:32:40.690
where all the fish swim through and underneath.

4867
03:32:42.000 --> 03:32:44.520
There's no structure or designs of anything

4868
03:32:44.520 --> 03:32:45.580
under there that catches your attention,

4869
03:32:45.580 --> 03:32:46.413
if that's what you're looking for,

4870
03:32:46.413 --> 03:32:48.060
just a beautiful, clear lake.

4871
03:32:48.060 --> 03:32:51.220
Maybe about 150,

4872
03:32:51.220 --> 03:32:52.090
200 feet across.

4873
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:55.800
TALIESIN: Welcome to the Court of Beasts.

4874
03:32:56.740 --> 03:33:00.140
Let's head to the cave.
TRAVIS: All right, sure.

4875
03:33:00.140 --> 03:33:01.060
LIAM: I'll say just for the heck of it,

4876
03:33:01.060 --> 03:33:02.250
while they were doing that inspection,

4877
03:33:02.250 --> 03:33:04.780
that Caleb hit himself with some Fortune's Favor.

4878
03:33:04.780 --> 03:33:06.920
MATT: Okay, go for it.
TRAVIS: As we're walking,

4879
03:33:06.920 --> 03:33:08.900
these statues of these beasts,

4880
03:33:08.900 --> 03:33:11.240
do they have a base or platform or do they

4881
03:33:11.240 --> 03:33:15.822
seem to be perfectly carved animals on the earth?

4882
03:33:15.822 --> 03:33:18.150
MATT: I mean, some of them are
sunken in a bit to the ground,

4883
03:33:18.150 --> 03:33:21.970
but they don't have a set base or a solid platform or dais,

4884
03:33:21.970 --> 03:33:24.810
they're just sculptures set in the earth.

4885
03:33:24.810 --> 03:33:25.660
TRAVIS: Give it a look.

4886
03:33:27.370 --> 03:33:29.000
See if they're actually sculptures.

4887
03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:32.640
MARISHA: I think that's a good call.
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4888
03:33:32.640 --> 03:33:33.830
MARISHA: You helping me out?
TRAVIS: Yep.

4889
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:35.449
MARISHA: All right.

4890
03:33:37.022 --> 03:33:39.571
LAURA: Oh, I already checked it out, they're fine.
MATT: Yeah.

4891
03:33:39.571 --> 03:33:42.790
I will say because she's already checked independently,

4892
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:45.690
this will be independent check as opposed to an aided one.

4893
03:33:46.640 --> 03:33:49.140
So just roll one.
LIAM: Start over.

4894
03:33:53.860 --> 03:33:56.071
MARISHA: 10.
MATT: 10.

4895
03:33:56.071 --> 03:33:56.905
MARISHA: Great.

4896
03:33:58.280 --> 03:34:01.113
MATT: I mean, they're statues, they're well carved.

4897
03:34:03.430 --> 03:34:05.010
As you do walk along, though, you do see

4898
03:34:05.010 --> 03:34:06.760
broken bits of them, you see parts.

4899
03:34:06.760 --> 03:34:07.910
Some of them are older, apparently,

4900
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:08.743
that have been chipped off.

4901
03:34:08.743 --> 03:34:13.190
You see a broken hand or a head of a creature that's cracked

4902
03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:15.690
and partially sunken into some of the fresh earth.

4903
03:34:19.450 --> 03:34:21.120
You begin to see the beast idols

4904
03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:24.400
intertwined now with carved idols of humanoid people

4905
03:34:24.400 --> 03:34:26.613
the further you get to the cave.

4906
03:34:26.613 --> 03:34:29.330
You see some are adorned in travel attire,

4907
03:34:29.330 --> 03:34:31.770
some in battle attire, some are captured

4908
03:34:31.770 --> 03:34:35.420
in a moment of heroic struggle, some are visibly worn,

4909
03:34:35.420 --> 03:34:36.870
many are kept well enough to

4910
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:40.100
appear polished and new, it's a variety.

4911
03:34:40.100 --> 03:34:42.533
LIAM: One minor question. You said all different kinds of

4912
03:34:42.533 --> 03:34:44.400
animals that we'd recognize mixed in.

4913
03:34:44.400 --> 03:34:46.820
Are there any that are strange, out of the ordinary

4914
03:34:46.820 --> 03:34:49.440
type animals we've never seen before?

4915
03:34:50.430 --> 03:34:51.690
MATT: None that are as alien as the ones that you

4916
03:34:51.690 --> 03:34:54.350
currently encountered or recently encountered.

4917
03:34:54.350 --> 03:34:55.620
A lot of them are--

4918
03:34:55.620 --> 03:34:57.730
a lot of them wouldn't be jungle beasts, necessarily.

4919
03:34:57.730 --> 03:35:00.830
You see a large elk and you see one across the way

4920
03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:03.120
that looks like a giant horned oxen

4921
03:35:03.120 --> 03:35:05.720
that you've never seen in your life.

4922
03:35:05.720 --> 03:35:08.248
That wouldn't be in a jungle.

4923
03:35:09.300 --> 03:35:11.200
MATT: But it is a menagerie.

4924
03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:12.890
TRAVIS: Caduceus, as we're walking over to the cave,

4925
03:35:12.890 --> 03:35:15.890
do you mind if I swim alongside you?

4926
03:35:23.153 --> 03:35:25.719
TALIESIN: Be careful not to drink the water.

4927
03:35:28.050 --> 03:35:29.380
TRAVIS: Right, sure.

4928
03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:34.361
SAM: Why? Do you think--

4929
03:35:34.361 --> 03:35:35.194
TALIESIN: Oh.

4930
03:35:36.640 --> 03:35:38.465
Because it's for the beasts.

4931
03:35:40.570 --> 03:35:43.280
TRAVIS: Oh, no, that was entirely too ominous.

4932
03:35:43.280 --> 03:35:45.110
I don't need to swim, it's okay.

4933
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:46.576
(laughter)

4934
03:35:46.576 --> 03:35:48.060
Never mind.

4935
03:35:48.060 --> 03:35:50.400
TALIESIN: Seemed so happy to poke the--

4936
03:35:52.652 --> 03:35:54.560
TRAVIS: Do you think that perhaps these animals

4937
03:35:54.560 --> 03:35:57.210
drank of the water and turned to stone?

4938
03:35:57.210 --> 03:35:59.130
TALIESIN: I don't know.
SAM: Do you want to find out?

4939
03:35:59.130 --> 03:36:01.130
TALIESIN: I don't think so.
TRAVIS: Not particularly.

4940
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:03.980
SAM: No, I mean, like--
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

4941
03:36:03.980 --> 03:36:06.363
SAM: I've got some stuff that I could try to use.

4942
03:36:07.340 --> 03:36:08.940
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

4943
03:36:08.940 --> 03:36:10.490
SAM: I bought these vials.

4944
03:36:14.220 --> 03:36:16.503
Willowshade oil.

4945
03:36:16.503 --> 03:36:17.810
LAURA: What's it do?

4946
03:36:17.810 --> 03:36:20.542
SAM: You can un-petrify someone.

4947
03:36:22.574 --> 03:36:24.340
TALIESIN: (chuckling)

4948
03:36:24.340 --> 03:36:26.939
SAM: Oh, but maybe not.

4949
03:36:26.939 --> 03:36:28.770
(laughter)

4950
03:36:28.770 --> 03:36:31.200
TRAVIS: What does the surgeon general's warning label say?

4951
03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:32.720
SAM: I forgot.

4952
03:36:32.720 --> 03:36:37.292
It has to-- it's been petrified for the last minute.

4953
03:36:37.292 --> 03:36:39.220
It has to be recently petrified.

4954
03:36:39.220 --> 03:36:40.620
MATT: It's got to be a rapid application.

4955
03:36:40.620 --> 03:36:43.230
SAM: Never mind.
TRAVIS: It's all right.

4956
03:36:43.230 --> 03:36:44.480
LAURA: Plus, they're not petrified.

4957
03:36:44.480 --> 03:36:46.760
These things are just really cool statues.

4958
03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:47.820
SAM: You're right.
TALIESIN: There's nothing--

4959
03:36:47.820 --> 03:36:51.830
There's no statues poised in fear or anything or--

4960
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:53.721
MATT: There's a couple.

4961
03:36:53.721 --> 03:36:55.400
MARISHA: <i>Oh.</i>

4962
03:36:55.400 --> 03:36:57.750
MATT: The further you walk, you see a few more.

4963
03:36:59.610 --> 03:37:02.360
And that ominous sense begins to come over you

4964
03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:04.700
as you begin to see some of these

4965
03:37:06.460 --> 03:37:09.680
arrayed in positions of people trying to

4966
03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:11.810
possibly defend themselves as groups.

4967
03:37:11.810 --> 03:37:15.035
MARISHA: Wait, people?
LAURA: Yeah, there are people now.

4968
03:37:15.035 --> 03:37:16.340
MATT: A handful of people you've started to find

4969
03:37:16.340 --> 03:37:17.870
and they're getting more and more numerous

4970
03:37:17.870 --> 03:37:19.460
the closer to the cave you get.

4971
03:37:19.460 --> 03:37:21.370
TRAVIS: I don't know that this would ever come in handy,

4972
03:37:21.370 --> 03:37:26.330
but I'm going to cast
Water Breathing on everyone in the party

4973
03:37:26.330 --> 03:37:28.020
for 24 hours.
MATT: Okay.

4974
03:37:28.020 --> 03:37:29.520
TRAVIS: So you can all breathe underwater

4975
03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:31.908
just in case you find the need to

4976
03:37:31.908 --> 03:37:35.280
dive under the waves of the lake.

4977
03:37:35.280 --> 03:37:37.220
MARISHA: So we're in the cave.
MATT: You're not in the cave,

4978
03:37:37.220 --> 03:37:39.330
you're walking towards it along the northern bank

4979
03:37:39.330 --> 03:37:41.080
to the western side--
TALIESIN: This is getting odd.

4980
03:37:41.080 --> 03:37:42.530
SAM: Do you have to go through the water?

4981
03:37:42.530 --> 03:37:43.980
LAURA: No.
SAM: Okay.

4982
03:37:43.980 --> 03:37:45.300
TRAVIS: Just in case it's a visual thing

4983
03:37:45.300 --> 03:37:47.650
and water can help refract, I don't know.

4984
03:37:47.650 --> 03:37:50.500
TALIESIN: I want to start inspecting these people.

4985
03:37:50.500 --> 03:37:52.808
MATT: Make a perception check.

4986
03:37:52.808 --> 03:37:54.466
TALIESIN: I am going to aid myself

4987
03:37:54.466 --> 03:37:57.288
because this is giving me the heebie jeebies.

4988
03:37:59.640 --> 03:38:01.690
Ooh, 29.
MATT: 29.

4989
03:38:01.690 --> 03:38:05.098
TALIESIN: Actually, it's--
SAM: 72.

4990
03:38:06.310 --> 03:38:07.580
TALIESIN: 30.
MATT: Okay.

4991
03:38:08.540 --> 03:38:09.680
You begin glancing past

4992
03:38:09.680 --> 03:38:11.110
and what first you thought were just statues,

4993
03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:13.600
you begin to look towards some of these people

4994
03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:15.230
in terms of the faces, the expressions,

4995
03:38:15.230 --> 03:38:19.000
beautifully captured, these moments of intensity,

4996
03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:21.590
moments of anger, moments of fear,

4997
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:24.770
it's a wide variety of emotions,

4998
03:38:24.770 --> 03:38:27.203
but they're intricately carved.

4999
03:38:28.830 --> 03:38:31.720
There's one off towards the shore that you look over,

5000
03:38:31.720 --> 03:38:33.850
right near the water's edge, you see two taller figures

5001
03:38:33.850 --> 03:38:35.300
that strike a familiar sight,

5002
03:38:36.450 --> 03:38:40.798
both firbolg captured in an emotional moment of fear.

5003
03:38:40.798 --> 03:38:43.256
The pair, female and older, they indeed resemble

5004
03:38:43.256 --> 03:38:46.630
your mother, Constance, and your aunt, Corrin.

5005
03:38:46.630 --> 03:38:49.530
About 15 feet from them, another pair of figures

5006
03:38:49.530 --> 03:38:52.510
captured in stone resemble your sister, Calliope,

5007
03:38:52.510 --> 03:38:54.250
her face resolute and her body fallen

5008
03:38:54.250 --> 03:38:56.050
at an odd, stiff angle, while the other

5009
03:38:56.050 --> 03:38:57.870
resembles your father, Cornelius,

5010
03:38:57.870 --> 03:39:00.210
seeming to try and pull her from the dirt

5011
03:39:00.210 --> 03:39:05.127
like a heavy chunk of a tree, he himself captured in stone.

5012
03:39:10.414 --> 03:39:11.331
LIAM: Caduceus?

5013
03:39:14.440 --> 03:39:16.182
TALIESIN: We have to be very careful.

5014
03:39:17.310 --> 03:39:18.518
This is,

5015
03:39:21.120 --> 03:39:23.482
these are <i>my</i> people.

5016
03:39:23.482 --> 03:39:27.000
LAURA: Do you, is this, they were petrified?

5017
03:39:28.260 --> 03:39:31.201
TALIESIN: Let's back up, let's--

5018
03:39:31.201 --> 03:39:32.892
MARISHA: What do you mean?

5019
03:39:33.810 --> 03:39:36.790
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly start pushing everyone

5020
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:38.760
back into the treeline.
MATT: Okay.

5021
03:39:38.760 --> 03:39:41.020
As you take one step back and give everyone the point,

5022
03:39:41.020 --> 03:39:45.890
you hear from the treeline (heavy footfalls).

5023
03:39:45.890 --> 03:39:48.958
Heavy sounds, earthy impacts of dirt

5024
03:39:48.958 --> 03:39:50.773
begin to find your ears.

5025
03:39:50.773 --> 03:39:52.960
You glance towards the lifted shore

5026
03:39:52.960 --> 03:39:56.951
where the treeline stands and you see

5027
03:39:56.951 --> 03:39:58.834
some deranged beast

5028
03:39:58.834 --> 03:40:02.690
of some kind emerging from the shadowy edge.

5029
03:40:02.690 --> 03:40:06.272
The massive, swollen bull-like creature

5030
03:40:07.660 --> 03:40:11.720
begins to pick up speed towards you, its thundering hooves,

5031
03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:16.720
its body a slightly-pulling tapestry

5032
03:40:16.872 --> 03:40:21.110
of metallic plates where large spines

5033
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:23.650
of darkened metal emerge between them,

5034
03:40:23.650 --> 03:40:26.900
its eyes glowing angry as between where

5035
03:40:26.900 --> 03:40:31.900
its limbs meet its body, little plumes of green fume

5036
03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:35.216
emerge and drift around it

5037
03:40:35.216 --> 03:40:39.331
as it begins to rush towards you.

5038
03:40:39.331 --> 03:40:41.041
And that's where we're going to pick up next week.

5039
03:40:41.041 --> 03:40:43.291
(groaning)

5040
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:49.546
SAM: Your family?
MARISHA: Oh shit.

5041
03:40:49.546 --> 03:40:51.754
TALIESIN: It's not everybody, but it's a lot.

5042
03:40:51.754 --> 03:40:54.220
TRAVIS: Does Greater Restoration--

5043
03:40:54.220 --> 03:40:56.436
LAURA: Greater Restoration undoes petrification.

5044
03:40:56.436 --> 03:40:57.502
MATT: It does.
TRAVIS: To how many people?

5045
03:40:57.502 --> 03:40:58.685
MATT and MARISHA: To one.

5046
03:40:58.685 --> 03:41:00.286
MARISHA: One at a time.

5047
03:41:00.286 --> 03:41:02.480
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Cool.

5048
03:41:03.472 --> 03:41:04.480
SAM: Oh no.
LAURA: Well, we have to--

5049
03:41:04.480 --> 03:41:06.795
TALIESIN: And that burns a big spell.

5050
03:41:06.795 --> 03:41:08.377
MARISHA: 5th-level, right?

5051
03:41:08.377 --> 03:41:11.382
TRAVIS: And then we have to preserve the statues, right?

5052
03:41:11.382 --> 03:41:13.580
TALIESIN: We just have to fight somewhere else than here.

5053
03:41:13.580 --> 03:41:15.150
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: How fast can we--

5054
03:41:15.150 --> 03:41:15.983
well, we'll find out how--

5055
03:41:15.983 --> 03:41:18.736
MARISHA: Is this like a minotaur? What is it?

5056
03:41:18.736 --> 03:41:20.294
MATT: It is a massive-looking

5057
03:41:20.294 --> 03:41:23.600
bull creature, larger than any bull you've ever seen,

5058
03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:27.950
its body swollen and muscular, metal-plated,

5059
03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:29.420
in a colossus-type way,

5060
03:41:29.420 --> 03:41:32.170
but jagged and not meeting properly

5061
03:41:32.170 --> 03:41:34.430
and these giant spines protruding from it.

5062
03:41:34.430 --> 03:41:37.820
LAURA: So the metal plates are not natural on it?

5063
03:41:37.820 --> 03:41:39.433
I guess we'll find out--
MATT: You don't know.

5064
03:41:39.433 --> 03:41:42.670
MARISHA: Is it quadrupedal or bipedal?
MATT: Quadrupedal.

5065
03:41:42.670 --> 03:41:43.503
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

5066
03:41:43.503 --> 03:41:47.680
MATT: Rushing towards you immediately at about maybe

5067
03:41:47.680 --> 03:41:49.620
60 or so feet from you.
LIAM: It has to stand up.

5068
03:41:49.620 --> 03:41:51.238
MATT: So we'll pick up from there next week.

5069
03:41:51.238 --> 03:41:53.229
LAURA: How far from the shore are we?

5070
03:41:53.229 --> 03:41:55.570
MATT: We'll figure that out next week.
LAURA: (yelling)

5071
03:41:55.570 --> 03:41:56.980
MATT: You guys are pretty close to the shore

5072
03:41:56.980 --> 03:41:58.750
and just began to move away when you heard this

5073
03:41:58.750 --> 03:42:01.587
and turned and saw it, so.
MARISHA: But we can't destroy them.

5074
03:42:01.587 --> 03:42:02.937
The people.

5075
03:42:02.937 --> 03:42:04.780
SAM: Sorry, you okay?
LAURA: Yeah.

5076
03:42:04.780 --> 03:42:06.060
MATT: Oh yeah, it'd be real bad to let this thing

5077
03:42:06.060 --> 03:42:07.330
get near any of these, wouldn't it?

5078
03:42:07.330 --> 03:42:10.360
TRAVIS: Navy SEAL that shit.
LIAM: Put them back together.

5079
03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:14.567
SAM: Complicated battle ahead.What a reason to tune in!

5080
03:42:14.567 --> 03:42:15.442
(laughter)

5081
03:42:15.442 --> 03:42:17.858
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

5082
03:42:17.858 --> 03:42:20.562
MATT: There's a reason they hadn't
gotten back to you or been home in a while.

5083
03:42:20.562 --> 03:42:22.520
LAURA: Buddy. Caduceus.
TALIESIN: I know, I know.

5084
03:42:22.520 --> 03:42:24.745
MATT: I'm sorry, buddy.
ASHLEY: You knew something was going on.

5085
03:42:24.745 --> 03:42:25.873
TALIESIN: I knew something was going on.

5086
03:42:25.873 --> 03:42:27.998
TRAVIS: Okay. (grunts)
MATT: All right!

5087
03:42:27.998 --> 03:42:31.208
Well, we'll pick this up next Thursday.

5088
03:42:31.208 --> 03:42:32.274
ASHLEY: Wowzers.

5089
03:42:32.274 --> 03:42:35.024
MATT: In the meantime, have a wonderful week, guys.

5090
03:42:35.024 --> 03:42:37.520
Stay tuned tomorrow at 7:00pm on our Twitch channel

5091
03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:39.793
to watch live our Monsterhearts one-shot

5092
03:42:39.793 --> 03:42:41.030
with these two lovely people

5093
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:42.530
with two other very lovely people.

5094
03:42:42.530 --> 03:42:44.120
TALIESIN: It was so fun.

5095
03:42:44.120 --> 03:42:45.921
MARISHA: So angsty.
MATT: So angsty, so--

5096
03:42:45.921 --> 03:42:48.558
MARISHA: So moody.
MATT: So teen awkward, horny--

5097
03:42:48.558 --> 03:42:50.790
TALIESIN: We're so awkward--
MATT: It's going to be hilarious.

5098
03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:54.360
MARISHA: Get some chocolates, get a pizza.

5099
03:42:54.360 --> 03:42:55.980
Curl up on the couch.

5100
03:42:56.980 --> 03:42:59.430
Transport yourself back to the '90s.

5101
03:42:59.430 --> 03:43:01.462
It'll be great.
MATT: Yeah.

5102
03:43:01.462 --> 03:43:04.440
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: But, nevertheless,

5103
03:43:04.440 --> 03:43:06.790
have a wonderful week, we love you very much,

5104
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:08.870
and is it Thursday yet?

5105
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:10.287
Good night, guys.

5106
03:43:11.227 --> 03:43:13.977
(dramatic music)

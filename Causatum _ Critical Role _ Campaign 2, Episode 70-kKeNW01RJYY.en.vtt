00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.850
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.120
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.410
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.138
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.354
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:09.987
LAURA: Dragons.
TRAVIS: Come on!

7
00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:12.310
LAURA: Sorry, I was distracted by Sam's--

8
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.949
MATT: It'll do that.

9
00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.430
We have a Liam O'Brien via internet connection

10
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.850
for the evening as he's been out for the week

11
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.991
with his family.
LAURA: He-ey!

12
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:22.540
(laughter)

13
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.772
MATT: Good job, that's about right sure!

14
00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:25.798
Perfect.

15
00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:28.300
(laughter)

16
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.410
MARISHA: Skipped that elective.

17
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.993
MATT: Exactly.

18
00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:32.890
Apologies in advance, don't flip out,

19
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.810
I rushed out of the shower, forgot my bands,

20
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.643
so I know people will be like,

21
00:00:35.643 --> 00:00:36.860
"What's wrong, what's different?"

22
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.890
"He's lost his power tonight." Maybe, we'll see.

23
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.700
LAURA: Oh my god, what if he rolls really bad?

24
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.780
MATT: Then it'll prove a lot of theories.

25
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.830
But yes, anyway, welcome.

26
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.510
Before we jump into tonight's game,

27
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.300
we're going to go through some quick announcements,

28
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.060
beginning with our fantastic sponsors for the night,

29
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.562
or quick for most of us.

30
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.640
Beginning with our first sponsor friends of Campaign Two,

31
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.457
from the very beginning, D&amp;D Beyond.

32
00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:00.810
(cheering)

33
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.640
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, guys, we all started off as voice actors.

34
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.740
Oh, you know what?

35
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.630
I didn't even look at what they sent me to read.

36
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.001
(laughter)

37
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.971
The D&amp;D Beyond Encounter Builder alpha version

38
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:16.910
is now available to all D&amp;D Beyond subscribers.

39
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.300
If you don't recall, it's a super handy tool to craft

40
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.000
unique and flavorful fights that fit

41
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.340
your current setting and difficulty level.

42
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.690
Check out the exciting updates

43
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.390
as they work their way through the alpha

44
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.730
including the official monsters who've now been added

45
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.130
and improved acce- oh.

46
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.270
And improved accessibility.

47
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.000
Check it out at the link in the chat.

48
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.178
Okay, we all--

49
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.980
MATT: Let me say, that's actually really cool.

50
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.500
Not to gloss over that, Sam.

51
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.940
Encounter Builder is actually really cool

52
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.182
and a really helpful tool.

53
00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:44.190
I've used it, it's been helpful, check it out.

54
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.310
It's awesome.

55
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.143
SAM: Yes!

56
00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:47.810
LIAM: I'm seeing the table for the first time,

57
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.180
is that a motherfucking fishbowl?

58
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.610
SAM: Yeah, there's lots of stuff, Liam.

59
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.430
Anyway, what Matt said. That is important and vital.

60
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.273
Anyway, the bit.

61
00:01:58.273 --> 00:01:59.789
(laughter)

62
00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.360
We all got our start as voice-over actors

63
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.108
and for this week's D&amp;D Beyond ad,

64
00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.610
I wanted to bring us back to our roots

65
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.450
with an old-fashioned radio play.

66
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.130
Now voice-over really became an art form

67
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.190
in the 30s and 40s with radio dramas

68
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.270
like "The Shadow," "Mercury Theater," "The Green Hornet,"

69
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.480
and my favorite part of these classic radio dramas

70
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.950
was the sound effects!

71
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.080
So tonight, the Critical Role--

72
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.337
No, that's mine!
MARISHA: Oh, shit! Sorry!

73
00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:27.807
(laughter)

74
00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:31.460
The Critical Role radio players are going to take you back

75
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.716
to the Golden Age of radio, with me, Sam Riegel,

76
00:02:34.716 --> 00:02:37.220
providing sound effects.

77
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.790
Okay, here we go.

78
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.738
Okay, ready?

79
00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:42.620
(xylophone chiming)

80
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.040
MATT: We now return to our regularly scheduled broadcast,

81
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.856
The Adventures of Detective Clint P. McGinty, Private Dick.

82
00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:51.727
(knocking)
LAURA: (trans-atlantic accent) Come on in.

83
00:02:51.727 --> 00:02:54.580
(stomping)

84
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.780
TRAVIS: Chief, I came as soon as I heard the dispatch.

85
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.960
Somebody got iced?

86
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.220
Where's the vic?

87
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.595
SAM: Hold on, McGinty, let me light another cigarette.

88
00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:03.978
(flicking)

89
00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:05.470
(blowing)

90
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.390
I'm afraid it's murder, McGinty.

91
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.860
That's why you're here.

92
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.610
You're the best dick I know.

93
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.340
TRAVIS: Well, if you want to solve this case,

94
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.810
you're going to need all the dicking I can give.

95
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.140
LAURA: We all will. Walk with me, McGinty.

96
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.388
The body's over here.

97
00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:20.638
(stomping)

98
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.947
Just past this carpet.

99
00:03:22.947 --> 00:03:24.405
(stomping)

100
00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:26.970
LAURA: Stupid.
(laughter)

101
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.940
TRAVIS: Should I follow you over this gravel area?

102
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.003
LAURA: Of course.

103
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:33.338
(crunching)
(laughter)

104
00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.538
Let's stop here on this mound of silverware.

105
00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:37.788
(clanking)

106
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.479
Go ahead, kick that vacuum cleaner aside.

107
00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.359
(vacuum sound)

108
00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.140
(laughter)

109
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.599
And get rid of that pussy.

110
00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.432
(claps)

111
00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:52.786
SAM: Meow!
(laughter)

112
00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:54.058
LAURA: There you go.

113
00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:56.570
(laughter)

114
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.120
One dead body.

115
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.930
TRAVIS: Good gravy, that's a lot of blood.

116
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.100
I'd better investigate it by touching it

117
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.559
and squishing it around.

118
00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.226
(water pouring)

119
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.459
MATT: In this toilet bowl.

120
00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.959
TRAVIS: Curious. Yes, interesting.

121
00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.110
Mmm, yes, of course.

122
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.943
Well I--

123
00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.693
(dripping continues)
(laughter)

124
00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:20.390
I think I know who committed this crime.

125
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.620
LAURA: What, how?

126
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.037
TRAVIS: There's blood splatter here, on this bell.

127
00:04:24.037 --> 00:04:25.778
(thunk)
SAM: Oh, shit!

128
00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:27.170
(ding)
There it is!

129
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.676
And here on this clock!

130
00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:32.280
(alarm ringing)

131
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.373
TRAVIS: And here on this lightsaber!

132
00:04:35.378 --> 00:04:37.545
(buzzing)

133
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.280
LAURA: My goodness, you're right!

134
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.240
TRAVIS: There's a reason they call me

135
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.396
the best goddamn dick in L.A.

136
00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:46.440
SAM: (laughs)

137
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.400
LAURA: So who did it?

138
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.370
SAM: We're halfway done, guys.

139
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.020
(laughter)

140
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.750
TRAVIS: The only person I know who can kill this quickly

141
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.050
and efficiently is none other than D&amp;D Beyond.

142
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.833
LAURA: D&amp;D Beyond?
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond.

143
00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.040
In any violent encounter,

144
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.860
D&amp;D Beyond makes you much more efficient,

145
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.330
so you can slay your enemies without

146
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.574
having to look up rules and--

147
00:05:04.574 --> 00:05:07.480
(fart noises)

148
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.180
LAURA: (monotone) Sorry, I had curry before, continue.

149
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.630
TRAVIS: Anyway, D&amp;D Beyond is the perfect resource for

150
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.161
anyone who wants to defeat a creature in record time.

151
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:17.330
(fart noise)

152
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.180
LAURA: I also ate corn, cauliflower,

153
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.550
and Diet Coke with Mentos.

154
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.734
TRAVIS: It's fine, Chief, I'll just moonwalk over here.

155
00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:26.134
(stomping)

156
00:05:26.134 --> 00:05:28.318
SAM: Hee hee!

157
00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:31.115
TRAVIS: As I was saying, the killer must've subscribed to

158
00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:34.625
dndbeyond.com and gotten access to all their great content.

159
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.630
(fart noise)

160
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.468
LAURA: I forgot to tell you I also ate Red Hots,
a hoppy IPA, deviled eggs,

161
00:05:40.468 --> 00:05:42.580
raw artichokes, and Funyuns and bean dip.

162
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.870
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, Chief, I can't take this smell anymore,

163
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.841
I'm going to jump out this window.

164
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:51.390
(cartoonish plummeting noise)

165
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.581
SAM: Ba!

166
00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:54.460
(laughter)

167
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.280
MATT: And thus concludes another adventure of

168
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.601
Detective Clint P. McGinty, Private Dick.

169
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.917
(ringing)
SAM: Hey, I did it!

170
00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:04.910
(laughter)

171
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.910
TRAVIS: Oh my god, what the fuck is the matter with you?

172
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.410
SAM: I did it!

173
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.643
MATT: He did it.
TRAVIS: Do we clap?

174
00:06:12.643 --> 00:06:14.419
MATT: Whatever Sam did, he did it!

175
00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.144
(clapping)

176
00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:18.025
TRAVIS: Nice. Really good.

177
00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:20.360
LAURA: Good job.
SAM: That was my dream come true!

178
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.651
MATT: I'm so happy that we and our <i>sponsors</i>

179
00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:26.849
can facilitate <i>your</i> private dream, Sam.

180
00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.680
(laughter)

181
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.850
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

182
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.660
SAM: Thanks guys, that was real fun!

183
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.450
MATT: No, thank you, Sam.

184
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.930
And thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for your infinite patience.

185
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.873
TALIESIN: Oh, man.
TRAVIS: What a bit.

186
00:06:38.873 --> 00:06:42.170
LIAM: My favorite part was how you wove D&amp;D Beyond into it.

187
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.327
SAM: So cleverly! Organically.

188
00:06:44.327 --> 00:06:46.552
MATT: Seamless! Natural.

189
00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:49.120
Our second wonderful sponsor for tonight's episode:

190
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.553
our returning friends at The Rook and The Raven.

191
00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:52.903
(clapping)

192
00:06:52.903 --> 00:06:54.310
You guys, we've talked about them before on the show.

193
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.335
Check it out,

194
00:06:55.335 --> 00:06:58.230
they have these amazing bound campaign books you can get,

195
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.820
both as a Dungeon Master and as a player,

196
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.950
with spiral notes that you can change out different pages

197
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.380
for your campaign character notes,

198
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.960
all kinds of fun stuff, details.

199
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.260
MARISHA: My last note before the break was "Fuckin' Yasha."

200
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.858
TRAVIS: Yep, that sounds about right.
MATT: It's about right.

201
00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:16.360
MARISHA: You too can make very poignant notes like that.

202
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.470
TALIESIN: Fucking Yasha.

203
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.300
MATT: For a very limited time right now,

204
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.210
you can get the new Rook and the Raven campaign planner

205
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.650
with the cover designed by fantasy artist Leesha Hannigan,

206
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.000
friend of the show, awesome, awesome artist.

207
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.230
Also new in their store is the large format

208
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.140
14 by 11 inch disc-bound campaign atlas

209
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.730
which is available with both square

210
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.000
and dual hex grid pages which is cool.

211
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.880
A hex dual scale, I should say.

212
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.780
Sorry.

213
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.050
Also, the new Tome of Legends and Lore,

214
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.740
which features oversize discs and dividers

215
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.950
that let you organize and archive up to 300 pages

216
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.350
for your Mischief and Misadventure diary planners,

217
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.850
which these are.

218
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.580

219
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.512

All righty.

223
00:08:05.687 --> 00:08:09.030
We also have a couple quick announcements.

224
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.860
The continuation of our comic book series, Legends--

225
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.430
sorry, Vox Machina Origins.

226
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.650
TRAVIS: Yes!
(cheering)

227
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.620
MATT: With our friends at Dark Horse Comics.

228
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.500
The first issue is now available at comic shops, hopefully.

229
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.887
Some of the stores are sold out already, which is crazy.

230
00:08:22.887 --> 00:08:24.508
So check out and order,

231
00:08:24.508 --> 00:08:25.678
if you can't find it in the store, check online.

232
00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:27.210
Once again, I recommend you going to

233
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.370
your local game store, local comic store,

234
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.910
support the brick and mortars best you can,

235
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.670
and then if you can't find it, other avenues.

236
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.800
You can find it at critrole.com

237
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.540
as well as Comixology, Dark Horse Digital,

238
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.836
and where other great digital comic books are sold.

239
00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:47.640
Also, we'll be-- next weekend, Saturday, July 20th,

240
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.268
in Room 6BCF at San Diego Comic-Con!

241
00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:53.923
(cheering)

242
00:08:53.923 --> 00:08:55.495
TALIESIN: BCF.
MATT: 6BCF.

243
00:08:55.495 --> 00:08:56.861
TRAVIS: We can't make this up.

244
00:08:56.861 --> 00:08:58.650
MATT: Same room we had our panel last year.

245
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.500
Our special Talks Machina panel will be there.

246
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.390
If you're planning on going to San Diego Comic-Con,

247
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.520
hopefully you can come join us

248
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.040
and bask in the chaos that they inevitably always are.

249
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.990
Hope to see you there!

250
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.303
Laura, we have some updates from the merch side of things.

251
00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:14.310
LAURA: Yes, we do!

252
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.143
TALIESIN: Yeah.

253
00:09:15.143 --> 00:09:17.270
LAURA: Okay, to commemorate--
you may have seen this online already,

254
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.190
to commemorate the one year--

255
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.360
TALIESIN: One year anniversary, yes.

256
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.935
LAURA: Yeah, of dear Mollymauk's,

257
00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:25.340
we have this fabulous shirt.

258
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.017
You want to hold it up?

259
00:09:27.017 --> 00:09:31.320
Designed by our friend and artist Caemie,

260
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.748
I hope I'm saying that right, Caemiel.

261
00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:35.250
@Caemil on Twitter.

262
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.620
It's spelled fun, check it out on our Twitter

263
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.913
for find out exactly, go check it out.

264
00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:40.860
MATT: @C-A-E-M-I-E-L.

265
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.693
LAURA: There you go.

266
00:09:41.693 --> 00:09:43.090
TALIESIN: It's an amazing piece, I'm so pleased with it.

267
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.983
LAURA: It's so beautiful and if you zoom in,
you can see sparkles.

268
00:09:45.983 --> 00:09:47.550
It's on the shop, go check it out.

269
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.170
It's on pre-order right now in both the US and the UK

270
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.250
at the same time.

271
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.430
Then, in addition to this,

272
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.337
we have our Pride shirt still available.

273
00:09:56.337 --> 00:09:59.800
That is in the UK shop now

274
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.435
and so in addition to what we did here in America,

275
00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:05.360
in the UK for the month of July,

276
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.240
all profits are going to go to OutRight International.

277
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.510
SAM: Yes. Awesome.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

278
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.885
MARISHA: Super great.

279
00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:13.330
LAURA: And I want that shirt.

280
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.340
TALIESIN: It's so nice, I'm so excited.

281
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.817
LAURA: There you go.

282
00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.578
MATT: Thank you, Laura. Really quick,

283
00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:20.303
before we get started on tonight's game,

284
00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:21.136
just want to take a moment to remind

285
00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:23.020
each and every one of you

286
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.260
to love each other, both online and off,

287
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.930
as much as we love you.

288
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.338
It's important.

289
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.530
So. Anyway.

290
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.680
Without further ado.

291
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.770
SAM: I feel like <i>I</i> did something wrong.
MARISHA: I know!

292
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.918
MATT: Usually-- it's usually you, Sam.

293
00:10:38.918 --> 00:10:40.430
It's usually you.

294
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.170
But, nevertheless, with that all being said,

295
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.078
let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode--

296
00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:48.150
(ascending slide whistle)

297
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.331
(laughter)

298
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:52.125
Now he's in trouble.

299
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.696
of Critical Role.

300
00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.640

301
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.390

302
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.283

LIAM: --arts.
MATT: And welcome back.

330
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:35.431
(laughter)

331
00:12:35.431 --> 00:12:38.478
The delay's not helping you there, Liam.

332
00:12:38.478 --> 00:12:42.010
LIAM: I timed that precisely.

333
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.980
MATT: Fair enough.

334
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.813
So--

335
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.810
My music's having problems here.

336
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.290
That's okay.

337
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.650
I'll just start.
LAURA: Oh no!

338
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.290
Do you want us to just hum?

339
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.250
MATT: No, I should check that-
(humming)

340
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.760
Last we left off, two weeks ago,

341
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.520
after our week of break,

342
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.610
The Mighty Nein,

343
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.610
upon investigating a series of strange occurrences,

344
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.520
where portals seemed to open to various locations

345
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.950
and the Abyss began to appear across Xhorhas,

346
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.190
had found an individual responsible,

347
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.770
through scrying means.

348
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.495
Hunted down a meeting point,

349
00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:22.627
and where they fled northward to Bazzoxan,

350
00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:25.220
you followed this entity, this Obann,

351
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.230
into a subterranean tomb,

352
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.920
known colloquially,

353
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.810
or historically, as The King's Cage,

354
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.420
as you came to discover.

355
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.600
There, in the depths below,

356
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.640
you went through all manner of dangerous traps,

357
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.250
challenges, terrible creatures,

358
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.680
and reflections of yourselves, even.

359
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.763
Before eventually--

360
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.708
I think I got it now.

361
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.470
There it is.
(mysterious music)

362
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.180
Yeah, it's not the same without the music.

363
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.640
Before eventually coming to a chamber

364
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.750
where you found some sort of a tomb itself.

365
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.620
A sarcophagus was there.

366
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.030
Obann had essentially been letting

367
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.610
you do the hard work for him.

368
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.670
Beginning to read from a tablet,

369
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.100
the chains began to tear apart from this sarcophagus.

370
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.130
Attempting to stop him but failing, it completed

371
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.240
and as such, unleashed what you came to find to be

372
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.092
The Laughing Hand.

373
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:25.250
A champion, if you will, of the Crawling King, Torog.

374
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.690
In the sense of this battle, Obann seemingly was destroyed

375
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.430
but in his final moments, called out to Yasha,

376
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.280
connecting to this past connection they seemed to have,

377
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.830
and asking to avenge him.

378
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.933
At which point, she began to be overtaken.

379
00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:40.766
LAURA: No.

380
00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:45.700
MATT: It was Mighty Nein versus Yasha and the Laughing Hand.

381
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.320
The battle began to turn rapidly,

382
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.960
and you all turned tail to flee with your lives,

383
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960
and through a series of very, very tight choices

384
00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.210
and tactical decisions, managed to all make it out alive,

385
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.890
sealing the door behind you,

386
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.290
running through the remaining dangers

387
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.592
that led you into this chamber.

388
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.880
Considering the terrible scenario

389
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.370
of leaving your friend behind

390
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.520
under the influence of this entity,

391
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.870
you've made your way towards Bazzoxan

392
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.590
for an evening's rest to figure out what and where

393
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.660
The Mighty Nein are to go and do.

394
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.590
So, as you all make your way to Bazzoxan,

395
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.340
we'll say holing up for the evening,

396
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.100
purchasing another night of rest

397
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.690
at the top of the same shop.

398
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.670
Though, seemingly to yourselves, at least,

399
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.940
for this particular evening.

400
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.395
What would you like to do?

401
00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:50.664
MARISHA: We're all in the room?

402
00:15:50.664 --> 00:15:52.550
SAM: It's evening time, yes?

403
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.383
MATT: It is.

404
00:15:53.383 --> 00:15:54.740
By the time you get here, I'll say yes.

405
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.420
It's just past dusk and the sky is turning

406
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.780
from oranges to purples, the sun is down,

407
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.840
the dust storms are kicking up

408
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.630
and there's actually a pretty heavy wind outside

409
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.630
that you can hear whistling through bits of where the boards

410
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:09.460
in the side of this general store are a bit too wide,

411
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.790
occasionally rattling and clattering.

412
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.990
TRAVIS: As we came back in,

413
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.280
was a military presence in town same as it was before?

414
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.110
MATT: Yep.

415
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.410
TRAVIS: No increase, no decrease?

416
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.820
MATT: No increase, no decrease,

417
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.663
and all seemingly geared towards the sealed doorway

418
00:16:25.663 --> 00:16:27.760
that Bazzoxan was built around.

419
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.070
This ancient temple that is built into

420
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.237
this part of the Penumbra Range.

421
00:16:34.492 --> 00:16:36.999
TRAVIS: Well.
MARISHA: (sighs)

422
00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:41.990
You said we're heading to the Iron-- Forge?

423
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.823
TRAVIS: Anvil.

424
00:16:42.823 --> 00:16:44.770
MARISHA: Anvil, Iron Anvil.

425
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.603
SAM: What's that?

426
00:16:45.603 --> 00:16:47.470
Oh yeah, the place that you want to go.

427
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.551
The kiln.

428
00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:51.360
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's where I think we should go next.

429
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.240
SAM: You don't have any specific reason to go there,

430
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.280
you just have a feeling, right?

431
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.690
TALIESIN: I feel like a feeling's a very specific reason.

432
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.906
SAM: Fair.

433
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.980
Should we be warning people or cities

434
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.650
about the impending doom that is about to

435
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.290
trample its way towards the town,

436
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.900
and kill everyone inside of it?

437
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.786
MARISHA: You mentioned we were going to send
a message to the Bright Queen.

438
00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:19.580
TALIESIN: We should tell everybody here what happened too.

439
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.490
TRAVIS: How do we send that message?

440
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.710
TRAVIS: Are we--
TALIESIN: We need to rest, I think.

441
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.650
SAM: Can you send tonight?

442
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.553
LAURA: No.

443
00:17:28.553 --> 00:17:29.403
Not tonight.

444
00:17:29.403 --> 00:17:31.430
TRAVIS: Hold on, are we actually talking about

445
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.270
speaking to her directly via Jester's shit?

446
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.103
LAURA: Yeah.

447
00:17:36.103 --> 00:17:38.660
TRAVIS: Instead of just sending a rider?

448
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.130
SAM: They should know sooner than later, don't you think?

449
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.970
TALIESIN: Expedience.

450
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.910
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

451
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.950
LIAM: Why put a middle man between us?

452
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.150
TRAVIS: Okay.

453
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.290
LAURA: I can do it in the morning.

454
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.010
Sorry, I don't have it prepared today.

455
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.570
MARISHA: It's no bigs.

456
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.986
TALIESIN: It's a lot.

457
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.395
SAM: I should also bring up the fact that I have this--

458
00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:05.410
I'll take out the knife.

459
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.130
This knife from the statue

460
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.700
inside the cavern where we just were.

461
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.930
This knife thing?

462
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:11.763
TRAVIS: Dagger?

463
00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:13.300
SAM: This dagger that we-- yeah.

464
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.740
I don't know if they can trace this to us

465
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.440
or maybe it's bad to have this.

466
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.300
Maybe it's really good to have this, I don't know.

467
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.710
I'm just bringing it up.

468
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.910
LAURA: I think if you put it in the bag, we should be safe.

469
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:28.910
SAM: Maybe Caleb, can you identify it, possibly?

470
00:18:29.249 --> 00:18:32.530
LIAM: If there is anything to be found, yeah.

471
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.030
May I?

472
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.250
TRAVIS: Yeah, please.

473
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.460
SAM: Take it.

474
00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.220
LIAM: Okay, while the group deliberates further,

475
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.130
I will take my 10 minutes with my book and

476
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.020
see if there's anything to be found.

477
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.503
MATT: Okay, identifying the dagger, it is indeed magical.

478
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.100
I would hand you the paper, but you're not here.

479
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.950
LAURA: I'll take it!

480
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.788
MATT: So--
TALIESIN: That's fine, that's fine.

481
00:18:54.788 --> 00:18:56.530
(laughter)

482
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.089
SAM: Eager, eager.

483
00:18:58.089 --> 00:19:01.630
MATT: Sorry, buddy,
that's how it works out.

484
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.503
SAM: The Dagger of Denial,

485
00:19:03.503 --> 00:19:06.680
for Liam's edification. This silver--

486
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.610
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

487
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.365
SAM: Why don't you read it, you're a voice actor.
TRAVIS: Wait, it's legit?

488
00:19:10.365 --> 00:19:11.606
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yes!

489
00:19:11.606 --> 00:19:12.689
It's super legit.

490
00:19:12.689 --> 00:19:15.255
LIAM: Laura Bailey, do a Caleb impression.

491
00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:17.366
SAM: Do a Caleb impression, Laura.

492
00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:20.490
LAURA: I can't do a German accent, no, I suck!

493
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.745
Here, you're really good at it.

494
00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.461
TALIESIN: (German accent) This silver stiletto blade
bears intricate grooves

495
00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:27.520
that spiral from point to the ivory hilt and handle.

496
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.950
You have a plus two bonus to attack

497
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.720
and damage rolls made with this weapon.

498
00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720
TRAVIS: What?

499
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.940
TALIESIN: While attuned to this dagger,

500
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.120
you can spend an action to place the point of the blade

501
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.960
into any keyhole and seal it shut.

502
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.940
It's too thick for you, but I'm doing it anyway.

503
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.540
A keyhole sealed in this way cannot be unlocked

504
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.500
until this dagger is placed into that keyhole once more.

505
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.620
Attempting to seal a keyhole

506
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.840
unseals any previous sealed keyholes.

507
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.600
LAURA: Like, it's amazing!

508
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.530
TALIESIN: It's superglue.

509
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.130
TRAVIS: Where did that thing come from?

510
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.310
TALIESIN: From the doorway.
MARISHA: From the statue.

511
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.820
TRAVIS: No no no, I know, but what does it--

512
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.190
LAURA: How great is it that we actually

513
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:01.960
took it with us, you guys?

514
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.430
TALIESIN: This is actually--
SAM: Who could use such a thing?

515
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.056
MARISHA: This is like a tiny--

516
00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:10.060
LAURA: I mean, you are probably--

517
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.501
SAM: I could.
TRAVIS: Yep.

518
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:13.180
LAURA: Do you use any daggers ever, Nott?

519
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.590
SAM: I have a short sword that I sometimes use

520
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.330
but it's pretty weak sauce.

521
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.540
LAURA: Yeah.

522
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.820
SAM: I mean, I wouldn't say no to it,

523
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.180
but if someone else needs it more than I do.

524
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.278
TALIESIN: How much attunement do you have right now?

525
00:20:25.278 --> 00:20:28.834
LIAM: It is the most logical for you to use it, Nott.

526
00:20:28.834 --> 00:20:30.950
TRAVIS: Yeah, did you get up close a lot?

527
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.878
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: But if you do.

528
00:20:32.878 --> 00:20:34.210
It would be nice to have something.

529
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.043
SAM: Yeah!

530
00:20:35.043 --> 00:20:36.760
TALIESIN: It also has such a wonderful use.

531
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.130
LAURA: Beau does get up close.

532
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.000
SAM: Do you use pointy things?

533
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.090
MARISHA: I'm better with my fists.

534
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.811
LAURA: Makes sense.
SAM: Yeah, you are.

535
00:20:43.811 --> 00:20:44.861
TRAVIS: Can I see it?

536
00:20:44.861 --> 00:20:46.260
LIAM: Nott, just consider it a tool,

537
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.390
even if you don't fight with it.

538
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.910
Well, you can fight with it.

539
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.465
SAM: For locks and stuff, you're right.

540
00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:51.980
Yeah.
TALIESIN: Very useful.

541
00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.813
LAURA: Yeah.

542
00:20:52.813 --> 00:20:54.890
SAM: Good to-- I'll hang onto it for now

543
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.670
and if one of you guys needs it more, you can take it.

544
00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.760
MARISHA: I'm assuming it does 1d4, right?

545
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.170
MATT: Yeah.

546
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.560
MARISHA: But then plus two?

547
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.393
MATT: Plus two.

548
00:21:03.393 --> 00:21:05.680
MARISHA: On top of your dex?

549
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.190
Is this a finesse weapon?

550
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.082
Daggers are finesse weapons, yes.

551
00:21:10.942 --> 00:21:13.548
SAM: Oh, she's looking a little harder now.

552
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.610
LIAM: Oh, maximize.

553
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.937
LAURA: What kind of a finesse weapon do you use right now?

554
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.470
Your bo?

555
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.620
MARISHA: Can I use finesse weapons as a monk?

556
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.770
MATT: Anyone can use a finesse weapon.

557
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.317
It means you can use strength or dex for the attack.

558
00:21:31.317 --> 00:21:32.956
LAURA: Anybody can?

559
00:21:32.956 --> 00:21:33.789
MATT: Anybody can use either,

560
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:34.650
that's the point of a finesse weapon.

561
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.080
LIAM: Yeah, you just have to be proficient

562
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.360
to use your proficiency advantage.

563
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.110
MATT: Exactly.

564
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.683
I'm not sure, I'm pretty sure,

565
00:21:43.683 --> 00:21:46.530
I mean, it's good for rogues for multiple reasons

566
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.090
because it's a dagger.

567
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.618
It's also, I believe, considered a monk weapon.

568
00:21:51.618 --> 00:21:53.018
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's usually good for people who get

569
00:21:53.018 --> 00:21:53.851
right up on 'em,

570
00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:56.401
which now used to be three,

571
00:21:56.401 --> 00:21:59.958
only seems to be two.

572
00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:00.791
MARISHA: Oh.

573
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.485
LAURA and SAM: Yeah.

574
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.140
LAURA: Yeah.

575
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.770
MARISHA: Guess we'll be compensating a bit more.

576
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.280
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we will.

577
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:15.140
Hey Caduceus, this kiln you keep talking about,

578
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.160
how far is it from here, do you gather?

579
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.051
TALIESIN: I don't know.

580
00:22:20.268 --> 00:22:21.680
I've never been there.

581
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.000
TRAVIS: You've never been there?!

582
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.060
TALIESIN: No.

583
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.810
TRAVIS: You've been talking about it this whole time,

584
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.710
like it's--

585
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.050
LAURA: Yeah, but he's been saying
he's been searching for it.

586
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.857
TALIESIN: It is somewhere I'm supposed to go.

587
00:22:32.857 --> 00:22:36.823
TRAVIS: Do you know what it looks like if you see it?

588
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.260
TALIESIN: I think, when I did this description earlier,

589
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.543
I believe it's north,

590
00:22:45.543 --> 00:22:48.180
northwest of us.

591
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.660
LAURA: Is it Empire or is it Xhorhas?

592
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.240
TALIESIN: I don't think it's either.

593
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.090
LAURA: Oh.

594
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.160
TRAVIS: Oh, like in between the two?

595
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.890
TALIESIN: I think it's above it.

596
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.750
TRAVIS: We're just going all off the map,

597
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.533
all sorts of fucking ways.

598
00:23:02.533 --> 00:23:05.698
TALIESIN: It's a mountain without snow,

599
00:23:05.698 --> 00:23:07.870
it's one mountain without snow amongst others.

600
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:08.820
LAURA: So it's a shorty?

601
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.890
TRAVIS: Well no, I think because of heat.

602
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.278
TALIESIN: Because of the heat.

603
00:23:13.278 --> 00:23:15.080
LAURA: Oh, that makes more sense.

604
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.420
TALIESIN: And there's a salt plain with snow in front of it.

605
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.480
LAURA: Oh, because it's a kiln!

606
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.590
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

607
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.730
LAURA: So it's hot!

608
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.200
TALIESIN: I mean, one would hope.

609
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.390
LAURA: I understand!

610
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.720
So it's a volcano.

611
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.553
TALIESIN: Maybe.

612
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.020
SAM: Seems like we might need some more info

613
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.830
before we just start walking.

614
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.663
MARISHA: True.

615
00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:39.990
SAM: Do you have any sense of how far it might be?

616
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.520
TALIESIN: No, I mean I can meditate on these things,

617
00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.250
I've been feeling like we've been going

618
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.983
in the right direction.

619
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.440
MARISHA: Are there any more cities north of here?

620
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.720
I feel like we're pretty far north as it is.

621
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.640
TALIESIN: I have no idea.

622
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.040
MARISHA: I mean, to get more information,

623
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.710
it could take a lot of time.

624
00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.750
TALIESIN: Meditate once I've rested.

625
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.242
TRAVIS: And then there's fucking water.

626
00:24:05.242 --> 00:24:07.350
And then more fucking water.

627
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.720
MARISHA: What's this?

628
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.553
What's that say?

629
00:24:09.553 --> 00:24:10.700
LIAM: I don't have the map--

630
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.220
MARISHA: Jigow?
TRAVIS: Jigow!

631
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.763
TRAVIS: Mercer, what do we know about Jigow?

632
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.180
MATT: You know nothing.

633
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.358
SAM: Ji-gi-gi-gi-gow!

634
00:24:22.358 --> 00:24:23.760
TRAVIS: I know nothing about Jigow.

635
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.610
MARISHA: Me neither, do I know anything?

636
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.700
MATT: You proficient in history?

637
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.621
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

638
00:24:27.621 --> 00:24:28.930
MATT: Go ahead and make a history check.

639
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.050
Anybody who's proficient in history,

640
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.413
go ahead and make a check.

641
00:24:32.413 --> 00:24:34.840
TALIESIN: I don't even know why I'm looking.

642
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.380
MARISHA: 18.

643
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.482
LAURA: Roll, Liam, roll.

644
00:24:39.482 --> 00:24:44.482
MATT: All you know of Jigow is it remains--

645
00:24:44.784 --> 00:24:45.617
oh, what'd you get?
TRAVIS: 16.

646
00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:48.460
MATT: 16, okay.
LIAM: 16.

647
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.330
MATT: Beau's the only one who picks up

648
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.510
any information on this one,

649
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.460
and what you know of it is it's primarily a,

650
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.100
it's a collection of smaller villages,

651
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.380
partially goblin-based, partially orc-based,

652
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.610
that are very competitive,

653
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.733
largely a fishing community.

654
00:25:02.733 --> 00:25:04.020
MARISHA: Fishing village?

655
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.861
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Okay.

656
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:06.730
MATT: That's all you know.

657
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.310
TRAVIS: It's a goblin and orc village, slightly competitive,

658
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.030
and mostly fishing establishments.

659
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.250
SAM: Why?

660
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:17.638
I can hear the-- I can hear the god talking to us.

661
00:25:17.638 --> 00:25:19.888
(laughter)

662
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:24.262
TRAVIS: That's a good shot.

663
00:25:24.262 --> 00:25:25.820
SAM: That was a good shot.

664
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.683
TRAVIS: So Caduceus...

665
00:25:27.683 --> 00:25:28.880
SAM: But that's not where we're going,

666
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.510
that's just maybe on the way.

667
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.270
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't, yeah.

668
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.540
Well, we're going to try to send the Bright Queen

669
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.138
a message in the morning, right?

670
00:25:38.138 --> 00:25:40.765
LAURA: Then head out as soon as possible, I'd assume.

671
00:25:40.765 --> 00:25:42.430
TALIESIN: So perhaps she'll have

672
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.130
some opinion on the matter as well.

673
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.205
TRAVIS: Who, the Bright Queen?

674
00:25:45.205 --> 00:25:46.620
We're going to tell her where we're going?

675
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.010
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

676
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.010
TRAVIS: Oh, boy, look.

677
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.500
LAURA: What am I going to say, like what,

678
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.700
like: Oh hey, we did this really bad thing,

679
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.140
and we're trying to fix it?

680
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.840
TALIESIN: I feel like maybe it's taking responsibility

681
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.320
for something that's not necessarily--

682
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.530
LAURA: This really bad thing happened

683
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.850
while we were standing around.

684
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.060
TALIESIN: We happened to-- well,

685
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.393
We failed to stop this

686
00:26:07.393 --> 00:26:08.859
really bad thing from happening.
LIAM: We know more,

687
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:10.070
there is something bigger

688
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.163
than this war at the moment.

689
00:26:12.163 --> 00:26:16.003
This Obann, or whoever he really is,

690
00:26:16.003 --> 00:26:17.550
LAURA: All of this information is sounding like

691
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.630
a lot more than 25 words.

692
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.760
TRAVIS: Okay so, we unleashed a terrible evil

693
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.450
on the northern mountain line just west of Bazzoxan.

694
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.980
MARISHA: <i>We</i> didn't unleash it.

695
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.238
It's very-- a demon,

696
00:26:32.238 --> 00:26:34.607
flying man...

697
00:26:34.607 --> 00:26:36.180
TALIESIN: The person we were sent to track.

698
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.110
TRAVIS: How about an evil we unleashed?

699
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.060
LIAM: We didn't unleash it,

700
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.320
we were unable to prevent it from being unleashed.

701
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.561
MARISHA: I mean, if we want to call him the Crawling King.

702
00:26:45.561 --> 00:26:49.400
LAURA: Do we mention the fact that he took Yasha?

703
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.696
TRAVIS: No, I don't think she'll care.

704
00:26:52.696 --> 00:26:54.200
TALIESIN: I think that's a--

705
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.610
SAM: You don't have that many words, either.

706
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.970
TRAVIS: How many times can you send?

707
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.150
LAURA: Well, I could send like four times, but...

708
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.030
TRAVIS: That's a waste of your--

709
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.630
LAURA: Not necessarily, if this is important.

710
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.580
TALIESIN: This thing's been, this thing's escaped.

711
00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.660
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should say

712
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.280
the mountain ridge west of Bazzoxan,

713
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.500
a great evil has emerged.

714
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.660
TALIESIN: It had a name.
MARISHA: The Laughing Hand.

715
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.170
TALIESIN: Yeah, laughing.

716
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.400
MARISHA: Maybe if we tell them the name,

717
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.990
they could do some research, figure out how to stop it.

718
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.430
TRAVIS: I'm a big fan of being vague about ourselves

719
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.290
in this scenario so we are going to try

720
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.270
and find a remedy in the meantime,

721
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.920
maybe she'll have some thoughts about sending reinforcements

722
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.850
while we get the fuck out.

723
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.708
LIAM: Again, we say nothing about why we are not returning

724
00:27:37.708 --> 00:27:41.500
to see our new friends and to deliberate with them.

725
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.070
We're keeping that vague as well.

726
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.650
TALIESIN: We think maybe that there's an answer

727
00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.960
to stopping this thing further north.

728
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.793
MARISHA: Yeah.

729
00:27:47.793 --> 00:27:49.570
TRAVIS: Better to return with a possible solution

730
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:50.710
than nothing at all, right?

731
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.126
MARISHA: Plus, the amount of time it would take to

732
00:27:52.126 --> 00:27:53.342
even get back.

733
00:27:53.342 --> 00:27:54.970
TRAVIS: Yep.

734
00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.260
MARISHA: We're already halfway there.

735
00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.080
LIAM: Getting back is easy, I can get us back in an instant.

736
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.860
MARISHA: But the Bright Queen doesn't need to know that.

737
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.860
LIAM: Well, I'm just reminding you.

738
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.700
TALIESIN: But if she decides she wants to help us--

739
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.300
LAURA: You could take us to anywhere really fast now,

740
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.910
Caleb?

741
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.101
LIAM: Well, I can take you home

742
00:28:15.101 --> 00:28:17.710
through the tower in Nicodranas

743
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.927
and I can take us back to Rosohna.

744
00:28:20.927 --> 00:28:22.443
That's all for now.

745
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.760
TRAVIS: Anywhere there's a transportation sigil, circle?

746
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:33.620
LIAM: That's correct, if I can see and study a circle

747
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.710
in a new location, I can bring us there.

748
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.030
LAURA: Whoa.

749
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.805
LIAM: I can't just go anywhere willy-nilly,

750
00:28:38.805 --> 00:28:39.650
but I can return to--

751
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.900
LAURA: So once we went, we would be stuck.

752
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.780
LIAM: That's right.

753
00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.420
LAURA: Okay.

754
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.390
TRAVIS: You okay, Jester?

755
00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.965
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

756
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.410
I think I'm going to go to bed.

757
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:52.868
LIAM: But if we have very few words to offer,

758
00:28:52.868 --> 00:28:54.101
and keeping it vague,

759
00:28:54.101 --> 00:28:55.900
maybe, Caduceus, you're right. We tell them

760
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.450
that we have a lead.

761
00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.960
We are just pursuing it,

762
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.020
but that they need to be prepared for

763
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.740
something worse than the Empire.

764
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.257
Something different.

765
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.480
MARISHA: War between demon and angels?

766
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.010
Because that's what it certainly feels like.

767
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.790
TRAVIS: Who are the angels in the scenario?

768
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.979
MARISHA: I don't know.

769
00:29:20.979 --> 00:29:23.410
LIAM: We're still going on very little information.

770
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.130
MARISHA: There's a lot of celestial covering up.

771
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.150
TALIESIN: At the very least, we should also alert

772
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.140
people in the town right now about what's going on.

773
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.610
TRAVIS: Plus if that thing is going to smash its way out,

774
00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.000
we'll be able to find where it came from,

775
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.400
trace it back to its origin.

776
00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.000
I'm sure go to town on that iconography that was everywhere.

777
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.890
SAM: Well, before we alert this town,

778
00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.650
why don't we call the home office first and

779
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:52.259
she might say don't tell the people in town, I don't know,

780
00:29:52.259 --> 00:29:54.765
but we should ask her first.

781
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.620
TALIESIN: I don't disagree.

782
00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.020
TRAVIS: Let's turn in.

783
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.233
MARISHA: Great, it's been a long day.
TRAVIS: We're all smoked.

784
00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:05.120
I'm super tired and really bad.

785
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.208
TALIESIN: We all need to sleep.

786
00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:09.041
SAM: Okay, let's go to bed.

787
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:11.127
TRAVIS: I should be like--

788
00:30:11.127 --> 00:30:12.930
I'm really tired.

789
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.680
LIAM: I really need my cat

790
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.890
so I'm going to take the time before bed

791
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.860
to return Frumpkin to his feline form.

792
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.218
MATT: You got it.
MARISHA: Swollen eye.

793
00:30:22.218 --> 00:30:24.657
MATT: Go ahead and mark off the materials for that.

794
00:30:24.657 --> 00:30:26.073
MARISHA: Broken arm.

795
00:30:27.323 --> 00:30:29.512
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

796
00:30:29.512 --> 00:30:31.020
MATT: All right, so you got-- you okay?

797
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.010
TALIESIN: Yeah, I saw everything reset and it was like,

798
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.992
it was like being slapped in the face.

799
00:30:34.992 --> 00:30:37.050
(laughter)

800
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.810
Wow, that was a lot.

801
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:39.885
MATT: That was a lot.

802
00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:42.501
All right.

803
00:30:42.501 --> 00:30:43.625
You guys go ahead,

804
00:30:43.625 --> 00:30:45.540
prepare yourselves for an evening's rest

805
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.803
in the upper area of the Ready Room in Bazzoxan.

806
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.170
The wind is still strong

807
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.220
and sleep isn't the most easy to come to you

808
00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.330
with the sound of the windstorms blowing through,

809
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.830
swelling and diminishing and then swelling again.

810
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.020
The whistling, the battering,

811
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.540
and the occasional bits of sand and dust

812
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.010
get kicked up through the,

813
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.840
what you thought were mostly closed windows,

814
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.920
not properly sealed.

815
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.080
But, eventually you find yourselves

816
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.810
through sheer exhaustion and soreness,

817
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.330
finding a night's rest.

818
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.950
The room acts like a sauna in the morning.

819
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.458
Moreso now because of your

820
00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:29.320
post-battered experience.

821
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.140
As you all come to consciousness,

822
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:36.140
the sweaty, hot upper area of the Ready Room

823
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.280
is what jolts you to consciousness.

824
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.522
You find yourselves rested, and the day is yours.

825
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.690
MARISHA: How's the weather look?

826
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.190
MATT: Looking outside, the dust storms are not as strong

827
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.710
as they were yesterday, there's a light breeze,

828
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.708
a little cooler, which is nice.

829
00:31:51.708 --> 00:31:54.320
The sky is not completely clear, it's partially cloudy

830
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.137
but you can see blue and you can see sun.

831
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.518
MARISHA: Maybe we should move while the weather's clear.

832
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.176
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's all gather in a room, shall we?

833
00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:07.230
MARISHA: All right.

834
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.340
TRAVIS: Knock around, collect everybody, and join up

835
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.890
with Jester and Beau's room.

836
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.410
MATT: You're all in one big chamber.

837
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.660
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just kidding.

838
00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.576
MARISHA: Wait for anyone else to leave, I guess.

839
00:32:16.576 --> 00:32:18.990
TRAVIS: I almost died yesterday, so I'm a little loopy.

840
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.823
MATT: It's all good, yeah.

841
00:32:19.823 --> 00:32:21.670
The Ready Room is like a big hostel-like open space

842
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.595
with a bunch of beds everywhere.

843
00:32:23.595 --> 00:32:24.710
You guys thankfully were the only ones

844
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:25.820
that were staying there the night before

845
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.680
so there's nobody else in here that's an issue.

846
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.430
TRAVIS: Nice.

847
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.500
MARISHA: I'm going to go and peek out the door,

848
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.620
look downstairs, see if anyone's listening.

849
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.787
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

850
00:32:38.968 --> 00:32:40.310
MARISHA: 16.

851
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.020
MATT: 16, okay, you're keeping watch.

852
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.790
TRAVIS: I'll actually go-- will you be okay in here?

853
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.210
SAM: Yeah, it's a room.

854
00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.800
TRAVIS: All right. I'm going to head downstairs and just,

855
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.600
just keep an eye out in case our,

856
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.670
I don't even want to say the words,

857
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.490
in case our friend made it out

858
00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:01.330
and followed our tracks this way.

859
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:05.100
I'm sure that's not possible, just be safe.

860
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.640
SAM: You mean, followed us here to kill us all?

861
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.431
TRAVIS: Well, I mean we did walk through

862
00:33:11.431 --> 00:33:13.860
a terrible wasteland. I know it's been pretty windy,

863
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.960
so hopefully the tracks are gone, but--

864
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.570
SAM: She knows where we are, doesn't she?

865
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.060
LAURA: Yeah.

866
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.813
Yasha would know where to find us.

867
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.190
TALIESIN: That's assuming they
don't have something better to do.

868
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.329
TRAVIS: I'll go out and keep an eye out.

869
00:33:29.329 --> 00:33:30.762
SAM: Yeah, maybe you should keep watch.

870
00:33:30.762 --> 00:33:32.650
TRAVIS: If you see a bunch of Eldritch Blasts

871
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.618
coming through the roof.

872
00:33:33.618 --> 00:33:34.710
(laughter)

873
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.760
It's time to turn up, okay?

874
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.340
MATT: All right, so you're keeping an ear

875
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.080
for the two proprietors of the locale,

876
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.480
you're actually outside the establishment.

877
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.370
Make a perception check for me.

878
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:51.180
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding me?

879
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.170
MARISHA: Oh, welcome back.

880
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.003
TRAVIS: Four.

881
00:33:53.003 --> 00:33:55.131
MATT: Four, okay.

882
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:57.082
(laughter)

883
00:33:57.082 --> 00:34:01.160
You feel pretty confident that you're keeping a close watch.

884
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.480
All right, so while they're keeping watch,

885
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.860
what would the rest of you like to do?

886
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.560
SAM: Time to send some messages.

887
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.970
LAURA: Yeah, of course.

888
00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:11.310
SAM: You know what you're going to say?

889
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.350
LAURA: No.

890
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.183
SAM: Cool.

891
00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.610
Do you want to drink?

892
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:16.443
LAURA: No.

893
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.450
SAM: I'm going to have one.

894
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.353
LAURA: Okay.

895
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.134
MATT: Don't forget you still have Yeza back in Rosohna.

896
00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:25.967
SAM: Oh, I know.

897
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.027
MATT: Literally just sitting at home

898
00:34:29.027 --> 00:34:30.270
in the house that you were given, waiting.

899
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.090
SAM: We'll see how many messages this takes first.

900
00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:37.390
LAURA: I'm going to send the message to the Bright Queen.

901
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:38.223
MATT: All right.

902
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.865
LAURA: We tracked that guy.

903
00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.203
We followed him into a cave.

904
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:08.142
A great evil was unleashed.

905
00:35:08.142 --> 00:35:10.062
The Laughing Hand.

906
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:12.770
Our friend was taken.

907
00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:28.280
TRAVIS: West of Bazzoxan?

908
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.477
LAURA: West of Bazzoxan.

909
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.860
MATT: Very rapidly, the Bright Queen responds.

910
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.650
"There is a crypticness to your message.

911
00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.210
"Seemingly bad news,

912
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.843
"whereas I had hoped to give you good.

913
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.825
"Where are you now?"

914
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.630
LAURA: I'll send a second message.

915
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.830
SAM: Well, are you going to tell her?

916
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.270
TRAVIS: She's the only one that heard that, right?

917
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:01.530
LAURA: Mm-hmm!
TRAVIS: Okay.

918
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.430
TALIESIN: Yes.

919
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.660
SAM: We're going to tell her where we are.

920
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.590
TRAVIS: Oh no.

921
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.510
Look. Okay. I'm not there.

922
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.896
LAURA: Should I tell her where we are?

923
00:36:11.896 --> 00:36:13.433
TRAVIS: Do you remember "Terminator 2?"

924
00:36:13.433 --> 00:36:16.250
With the pay phone?
LAURA: Should I tell her where we are?

925
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.961
SAM: She probably has the power to come here.

926
00:36:19.961 --> 00:36:22.060
She probably has the power to come here instantly.

927
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.390
TALIESIN: Why would we act like we did something wrong?

928
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.873
LAURA: I didn't say we did anything wrong.

929
00:36:27.873 --> 00:36:29.330
MARISHA: How does it look?

930
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.050
TALIESIN: What did we do wrong?

931
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.690
SAM: We promised that we would take care of business

932
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:38.090
in the capital, we failed, and we failed up here as well.

933
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.770
MARISHA: We were still Empire shitbags

934
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:41.340
who were trying to prove ourselves.

935
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.230
But, you're right, we didn't do anything wrong.

936
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.970
It's just--
TALIESIN: It's just failure.

937
00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.890
MARISHA: The optics.
SAM: We failed.

938
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.240
When we promised that we--

939
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.488
TALIESIN: So this is the moment to start lying?

940
00:36:51.488 --> 00:36:53.280
LIAM: But we are trying to build a relationship

941
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.130
with power and these people.

942
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.050
LAURA: Yeah.

943
00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:02.050
LIAM: I think maybe honesty is the smarter play.

944
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.610
LAURA: I send a message.

945
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:04.443
MATT: Okay.

946
00:37:04.443 --> 00:37:06.260
TALIESIN: This is the only moment honesty's worth anything.

947
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.237
LAURA: We're in Bazzoxan.

948
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.960
We are planning to head north.

949
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.718
We think there might be a solution there.

950
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.790
The Laughing Hand is really bad.

951
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.150
I'm really sorry.

952
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.307
SAM: Should we tell people?

953
00:37:27.307 --> 00:37:29.640
LAURA: Well, I didn't ask that.

954
00:37:32.427 --> 00:37:35.227
MATT: There is a little more of a pause in response to this.

955
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:44.130
"I would hope for more information on this."

956
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.700
LAURA: I don't have all the words!

957
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.733
MATT: "How soon can you return?"

958
00:37:49.733 --> 00:37:51.570
MATT: "This should be discussed in person."

959
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.130
MARISHA: Fuck.

960
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.230
TALIESIN: We could return instantly.

961
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.948
LAURA: Technically.

962
00:38:00.124 --> 00:38:03.410
SAM: Mom wants us to come home.

963
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:05.293
What do we do?

964
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.090
LAURA: I don't know.

965
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.780
SAM: She's expressed her request.

966
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.613
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

967
00:38:12.613 --> 00:38:13.446
SAM: But I don't think we have to answer.

968
00:38:13.446 --> 00:38:15.050
We either come back or we don't.

969
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.580
LAURA: She asked how soon we can be back.

970
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.591
That's an open question that we should probably respond to

971
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:21.173
because she's a queen!

972
00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:23.423
(laughter)

973
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.120
LIAM: If you want to offer our return,

974
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.900
you have to tell her 24 hours because I did not prepare it.

975
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.020
LAURA: It's going to take some time, I'm going to say,

976
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.700
it's just going to take some time.

977
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.210
TRAVIS: It takes some patience and time.

978
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.060
TALIESIN: At least a day, that's what I'd say.

979
00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.217
MARISHA: Maybe this is a...

980
00:38:44.457 --> 00:38:48.152
SAM: A whole lot of spending money.

981
00:38:48.152 --> 00:38:49.960
MARISHA: I feel like maybe we've all been

982
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.385
avoiding the inevitable

983
00:38:51.385 --> 00:38:54.160
and maybe not talking about our priorities,

984
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.530
and we're all a group of assholes

985
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.370
who like running from things.

986
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.690
LAURA: Am I going to tell her all this?

987
00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.471
MARISHA: No, this is just me.

988
00:39:02.471 --> 00:39:03.600
(laughter)

989
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.952
SAM: We don't say this part out loud.

990
00:39:04.952 --> 00:39:06.160
MARISHA: Just thinking out loud.

991
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.583
LIAM: This is a think tank right now, circle of trust.

992
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.490
MARISHA: I don't know.

993
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.870
LAURA: I mean, we want to fix this, yeah?

994
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.530
That's our priority, yeah?

995
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.550
TALIESIN: We're being offered an opportunity to show faith.

996
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.540
To show trust.

997
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.860
MARISHA: Faith and trust in a woman and an army

998
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:36.470
who are building giant war machines

999
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.260
to send to kill people in the Empire.

1000
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.200
LAURA: I think we go north.

1001
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.602
LIAM: We've tried multiple times to try to convince her

1002
00:39:43.602 --> 00:39:45.970
to turn away from the course she's on

1003
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.830
and just fucking off is not going to help that case.

1004
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.570
MARISHA: Exactly.

1005
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.320
TALIESIN: I think we go back.

1006
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.670
I want to go north so badly.

1007
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.790
LAURA: I think if we go back,
she's going to put us in prison.

1008
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.040
TALIESIN: I don't think she's going to.

1009
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.820
TRAVIS: Do I see anything on the dusty horizon?

1010
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.070
MATT: Occasional plumes of kicked-up sand,

1011
00:40:07.968 --> 00:40:12.330
a few of the wandering Kryn soldiers just keeping watch,

1012
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.870
not showing much acknowledgement towards you.

1013
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.860
It's a hotter day out here so most folks

1014
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.110
that would normally be perusing the city

1015
00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.140
seem to be keeping to the shade,

1016
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.170
especially since a large portion of the drow here

1017
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.917
aren't big fans of direct sunlight.

1018
00:40:23.917 --> 00:40:25.600
But it seems a lazier day in Bazzoxan.

1019
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.120
TRAVIS: A pretty far horizon, but nothing like,

1020
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.370
oh, I don't know, the size of a huge, steroidal

1021
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.450
linebacker lumbering towards our direction?

1022
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.380
MATT: At the moment, no.

1023
00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.910
TRAVIS: Okay, great, I'll head back inside, go upstairs.

1024
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.100
MATT: Okay, Fjord joins you.

1025
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.600
LIAM: During this whole conversation,

1026
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.530
Frumpkin has been going from a member of the Mighty Nein

1027
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.590
to member and just rubbing against the line of their ankles

1028
00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.400
and going onto the next.

1029
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.000
He's trying to keep things chill.

1030
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
MATT: You got it.

1031
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.833
TALIESIN: I think if we run,

1032
00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:55.341
that's how you end up in prison.

1033
00:40:55.341 --> 00:40:59.468
I don't mean to raise my voice.

1034
00:40:59.468 --> 00:41:04.300
(laughter)

1035
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.750
TRAVIS: What'd I walk into?

1036
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.525
TALIESIN: Am I the only person here who doesn't

1037
00:41:09.525 --> 00:41:14.360
instantly assume that they're the bad guy?

1038
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.890
SAM: That they, you mean?

1039
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.490
LAURA: Us.
SAM: Us.

1040
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:18.900
TALIESIN: I mean, is anybody else here

1041
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:23.900
actually had any experience being just trusted

1042
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.950
and doing the right thing? Is this so alien, I--

1043
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.520
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

1044
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.010
I think for a lot of us, Caduceus.

1045
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.310
TALIESIN: We've got to go back.

1046
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.440
I want to go north.

1047
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.920
But we got to show faith.

1048
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.011
LIAM: He's right, the only reason to run

1049
00:41:42.011 --> 00:41:43.211
is to never come back

1050
00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:46.310
and we are trying to build something here.

1051
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:47.810
TALIESIN: We can never come back if we run.

1052
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.240
SAM: Well, regardless, if you tell her,

1053
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.780
we can be back as early as tomorrow.

1054
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.490
It still gives us a day to putz around here

1055
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.233
and maybe warn some folks and do some recon.

1056
00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:00.099
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Can we

1057
00:42:00.099 --> 00:42:01.732
just game this out for one second?

1058
00:42:01.732 --> 00:42:03.550
When we go back, we tell the Bright Queen that

1059
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.430
while trying to track someone for her,

1060
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.290
we helped to unleash a great evil

1061
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.865
that might fucking wipe out this entire--

1062
00:42:08.865 --> 00:42:09.698
LAURA: We don't have to--

1063
00:42:09.698 --> 00:42:11.210
TRAVIS: Let me finish, this continent.

1064
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.370
Okay?

1065
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.370
We're going to then ask to go out and pursue another lead

1066
00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.670
of another thing that might help the situation

1067
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.030
and she's going to say what?

1068
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.863
Yeah, go for it?

1069
00:42:19.863 --> 00:42:23.530
You're not going to unleash terrible
demon presence number two?

1070
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.373
TALIESIN: May I perhaps offer a slightly different

1071
00:42:26.373 --> 00:42:29.160
perspective on the last 24 hours?

1072
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.470
We walked into something

1073
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.780
we couldn't possibly have been prepared for

1074
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.860
that was far beyond us.

1075
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.790
If we had had triple the number of us,

1076
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.960
we would have been hopelessly overwhelmed

1077
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.080
and witnessed something that was inevitable,

1078
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.810
and are giving them time to prepare

1079
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.220
for this thing that was coming with or without us.

1080
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.390
We gave them a lead and we have another lead

1081
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.420
and there's no sense at this point

1082
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.590
of stopping anything that might save this.

1083
00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.540
LAURA: That is true.

1084
00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.560
TRAVIS: You know Obann used us.

1085
00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.740
LAURA: Obann used us though how?

1086
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.390
TRAVIS: The door, the last door doesn't get open without us.

1087
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.710
He waited for us, he baited us.

1088
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:08.680
TALIESIN: Of course he did.

1089
00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.710
TRAVIS: We got used.

1090
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.780
TALIESIN: Of course we got used.

1091
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.990
TRAVIS: That thing doesn't come without us.

1092
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.440
It stays in there.

1093
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.388
LAURA: Why did the last door without us?

1094
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.860
Why wouldn't the last door open?

1095
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.800
SAM: We defeated a lot of different traps

1096
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.760
and monsters to get there.

1097
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.593
LAURA: What if he--

1098
00:43:23.593 --> 00:43:24.710
TALIESIN: He would've just done it by himself.

1099
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.140
LAURA: He would be able to defeat them.

1100
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.480
It's not like he wasn't super powerful on his own,

1101
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.460
he just didn't want to waste the effort.

1102
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.170
TALIESIN: I think he wanted to watch us do it
because he enjoyed it.

1103
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.940
MARISHA: It doesn't matter, it's--

1104
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.950
LAURA: He'd have gone in and said that chant

1105
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.710
and nobody would've been there to stop him.

1106
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.640
TRAVIS: This sounds like a trial that I feel like

1107
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.950
we're going to have if we go back.

1108
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.316
MARISHA: It's all about the narrative that we present,

1109
00:43:46.316 --> 00:43:49.530
though. We told the Bright Queen that we had

1110
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:54.140
pretty strong evidence that this spy or scout

1111
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.350
was from the Empire.

1112
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.900
And that was true, that was the information

1113
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.680
that we were working off of.

1114
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.534
We simply tell her that the case ended up being

1115
00:44:01.534 --> 00:44:05.150
much worse than if he was just a spy of a different kind

1116
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.680
and we don't have to mention anything about Yasha's history.

1117
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.240
We don't have to talk about her again.

1118
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.124
TRAVIS: What if she asks?

1119
00:44:16.124 --> 00:44:18.962
TALIESIN and MARISHA: We lost her.

1120
00:44:18.962 --> 00:44:21.410
LIAM: We lost her, and we are the ones with the information.

1121
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.020
We're the ones who are able to suss this out.

1122
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.310
We're the ones who found this man

1123
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.214
and we witnessed what we witnessed.

1124
00:44:29.214 --> 00:44:32.160
No one in Rosohna did, we did.

1125
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.440
And that's how we play this.

1126
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.180
SAM: Fjord, not to be super selfish,

1127
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.974
but I do have the sneaking suspicion that if we run,

1128
00:44:40.974 --> 00:44:43.450
she might find and kill my husband?

1129
00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:45.110
I don't know, but maybe.

1130
00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:46.380
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're right.

1131
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.530
Look, if it's what everybody wants to do, we'll go back.

1132
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:51.040
Prison's not what I'm worried about,

1133
00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.910
I thought we could get out of it in the first place.

1134
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:54.801
I'm sure we're a bunch of talented individuals

1135
00:44:54.801 --> 00:44:56.492
that will make do.

1136
00:44:56.492 --> 00:44:58.592
TALIESIN: The only shred of guilt I feel about anything

1137
00:44:58.592 --> 00:45:02.150
we've done in the last 24 hours is losing a friend.

1138
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.050
Everything else, I know I did my best.

1139
00:45:05.492 --> 00:45:07.590
MARISHA: I feel a little guilty on my ego.

1140
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:10.920
I feel like we all knew we were walking into a trap

1141
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.350
and thought we could beat it.

1142
00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.400
LAURA: Yasha knew she was going into something,

1143
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.217
she kept saying it.

1144
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.610
TALIESIN: It's a terrible lesson.

1145
00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:25.380
SAM: Message her back and say tomorrow.

1146
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.213
TALIESIN: Ask if we should warn the town

1147
00:45:27.213 --> 00:45:29.421
about what happened.

1148
00:45:30.685 --> 00:45:33.440
SAM: Who we should warn the town.

1149
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.140
Probably give us a more concrete direction.

1150
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.130
TALIESIN: It's going to be okay.

1151
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:41.563
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1152
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.060
MARISHA: Our main goal is to convince her

1153
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.310
that this is bigger than the war

1154
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.185
that she is currently obsessed with.

1155
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:59.127
I think as long as we keep that as our main prerogative.

1156
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.200
LAURA: I send another message.

1157
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.700
SAM: Yeah!

1158
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.325
Fire it up!

1159
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.873
LAURA: Sorry that took a while.

1160
00:46:14.947 --> 00:46:16.147
TRAVIS: Awhile? A while?

1161
00:46:16.147 --> 00:46:18.288
Awhile.
SAM: It's one word.

1162
00:46:19.822 --> 00:46:23.505
LAURA: We can be there as soon as tomorrow.

1163
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.802
Yes, there's a lot to talk about in person.

1164
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.940
Should we tell anyone here?

1165
00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.773
And who?

1166
00:46:34.773 --> 00:46:36.392
SAM: Ooh, nice.

1167
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.500
MATT: "One day is sufficient.

1168
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.890
"Don't warn anyone yet.

1169
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.060
"We need to ensure this information is framed correctly

1170
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.220
"to avoid hysteria.

1171
00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.602
"We look forward to your return."

1172
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.032
LAURA: She said don't tell anyone.

1173
00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:08.799
TRAVIS: She said don't tell anyone?

1174
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.360
Last thing, and then I will truly put it to bed,

1175
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.580
does that not freak anyone else out just a little bit?

1176
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.620
TALIESIN: Just a little bit.

1177
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.420
MARISHA: There's a little 'bout her that freaks me out.

1178
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.550
TRAVIS: Right, we'd be talking about subterfuge,

1179
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.456
maybe spies, maybe double-sided spies,

1180
00:47:27.456 --> 00:47:29.890
maybe trying to unleash something at our own place,

1181
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.300
maybe trying to incite a war.

1182
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.520
I mean, look, I'm not the smartest man around

1183
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.500
but that reeks of terrible,

1184
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.988
to not even send the armed guard outside the perimeter,

1185
00:47:38.988 --> 00:47:41.440
investigative force to check it out?

1186
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.960
SAM: What if she doesn't trust the people

1187
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.930
in charge of the city?

1188
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.900
What if she doesn't, maybe there's someone here

1189
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.040
that she thinks might be aligned with the evil forces.

1190
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:55.040
We are close to this weird temple gate thing, right?

1191
00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.030
LIAM: She could be starting to wonder who she can trust.

1192
00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:02.410
TRAVIS: In one day, that creature can go any direction

1193
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.270
and cover any amount of distance.

1194
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.040
SAM: I feel like if it goes too far our of its cave,

1195
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.422
that roc is going to find it,

1196
00:48:10.422 --> 00:48:13.164
and we'll be fine.

1197
00:48:13.164 --> 00:48:16.570
It's still looking for a meal out there.

1198
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:19.120
The roc's going to get it for us.

1199
00:48:21.487 --> 00:48:23.970
MATT: Not the bird, the actual performer.

1200
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:26.290
SAM: Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
MATT: Yes.

1201
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.470
TRAVIS: D.J.'s coming.

1202
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.070
LIAM: Fjord, I think it is a gamble.

1203
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.550
It's not unreasonable.

1204
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:38.550
SAM: What do we do for 23 and a half hours now?

1205
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:39.500
Should we walk around

1206
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.511
and look at all the people who might die tomorrow?

1207
00:48:42.511 --> 00:48:44.870
MARISHA: Do we obey her?

1208
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:49.794
Or do we maybe just

1209
00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:51.882
speak a little loudly?

1210
00:48:51.882 --> 00:48:53.490
A little more loudly than we should

1211
00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.107
at the pub tonight.

1212
00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.430
TRAVIS: I'm a fan of educating these innocent individuals

1213
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.580
that may be incurring the wrath

1214
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.240
of a giant laughing death machine.

1215
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.420
If don't give 'em a heads up,

1216
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.450
maybe wander out and give it a look.

1217
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.140
SAM: We don't have to say the Laughing Hand is coming,

1218
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:14.840
we can say, "Oh, I heard some crazy monsters be coming!"

1219
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.990
TRAVIS: Yep. Sure.

1220
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:19.070
SAM: Better hide your kids!

1221
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:20.200
TRAVIS: Yep, hide your wife.

1222
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.140
LAURA: So in case she already doesn't trust us enough,

1223
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.810
we are definitely going to do something

1224
00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.890
she specifically said not to do.

1225
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:30.610
SAM: How about we just walk around
and get a lay of the land?

1226
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:31.990
Maybe these people aren't worth saving,

1227
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:34.646
we haven't even met them yet.

1228
00:49:34.646 --> 00:49:37.250
They could all be assholes or something.

1229
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.016
LAURA: I mean, honestly,

1230
00:49:39.016 --> 00:49:40.970
I don't give a fuck who we are with.

1231
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:42.520
I don't care if it's the Empire.

1232
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.410
I don't care if it's Xhorhas.

1233
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:46.844
I don't care.

1234
00:49:46.844 --> 00:49:49.387
TRAVIS: I mean, what does matter?

1235
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.000
What if these men have families

1236
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.370
who are out there in danger?

1237
00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.327
What if what we could say could help?

1238
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:03.230
LIAM: What if we don't fully understand

1239
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.524
what's going on right now?

1240
00:50:05.524 --> 00:50:08.382
MARISHA: Well, I would be willing to lay money down

1241
00:50:08.382 --> 00:50:11.650
on that one, that we don't.

1242
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:12.483
TRAVIS: I'll take that.

1243
00:50:12.483 --> 00:50:15.132
LIAM: So let's not go off half-cocked.

1244
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.810
TALIESIN: "Half-cocked," I like that.

1245
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:19.668
MARISHA: Caduceus.

1246
00:50:19.668 --> 00:50:21.130
TALIESIN: Yeah?

1247
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:23.730
MARISHA: You're a good guy.

1248
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:24.680
TALIESIN: Thanks.

1249
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.030
TALIESIN: What would a good guy do?

1250
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.940
TALIESIN: I'm so tired right now.

1251
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.250
SAM: We just woke up.

1252
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.152
TALIESIN: Ah, it's been a long day.

1253
00:50:35.152 --> 00:50:37.182
MARISHA: You said you don't feel like a bad guy.

1254
00:50:37.182 --> 00:50:38.835
TALIESIN: I don't.

1255
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.820
MARISHA: You didn't do anything wrong,

1256
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.860
we didn't do anything wrong.

1257
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.426
TALIESIN: We didn't.

1258
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.380
MARISHA: Is a good guy loyal to a queen

1259
00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:51.500
or is a good guy loyal to protecting citizens?

1260
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.680
LAURA: Should I scry on Yasha?

1261
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.810
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's a question.

1262
00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.118
TRAVIS: We're certainly going to be hanging around

1263
00:50:57.118 --> 00:50:57.960
for most of the day.

1264
00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.970
TALIESIN: Let's wait till the end of the day.

1265
00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.980
LAURA: What if maybe she's, you know, still in the cave?

1266
00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.370
What if her and the Laughing Hand haven't even gotten out

1267
00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.560
and then we don't have to warn anyone.

1268
00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.060
TALIESIN: What if they see you?

1269
00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:10.930
LAURA: Can they do that?

1270
00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.310
TALIESIN: Of course they can do that.

1271
00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:17.380
LAURA: Well then, she'll know she's not alone there

1272
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.213
and it's okay.

1273
00:51:18.213 --> 00:51:21.300
TALIESIN: I don't know if it's entirely her right now.

1274
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.600
TRAVIS: Do it, Jester.

1275
00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:31.170
TALIESIN: Sometimes it's okay to not know what's happening.

1276
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.260
And when you don't know what's happening,

1277
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.780
it's all right to sometimes

1278
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.553
submit to somebody with a higher perspective.

1279
00:51:43.194 --> 00:51:46.694
I follow a higher perspective as often as I can

1280
00:51:46.694 --> 00:51:48.330
and right now we're being offered

1281
00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.710
a slightly more mortal, higher perspective.

1282
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.290
If we had information that contradicted it,

1283
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:57.690
if we had other ideas, I would say that's one thing,

1284
00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:02.156
but simply just deciding that authority

1285
00:52:02.156 --> 00:52:05.006
should be

1286
00:52:05.006 --> 00:52:07.381
disavowed because it's authority

1287
00:52:07.381 --> 00:52:11.714
seems reckless.

1288
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.050
That's the only problem

1289
00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.970
anyone really has with her at this point.

1290
00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:16.810
SAM: I think you're right.

1291
00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.270
Having information would help,

1292
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:22.210
so I would be okay with you checking in on Yasha.

1293
00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:24.060
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1294
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.268
LAURA: I'll try it.

1295
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:30.032
MATT: Okay. You're ready to perform a scry ritual on Yasha.

1296
00:52:30.032 --> 00:52:33.297
LAURA: A fucking 5th-level spell early in the morning.

1297
00:52:33.297 --> 00:52:35.040
(laughter)

1298
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.860
MATT: Strangely enough, that's exactly the incantation

1299
00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.530
you require to scry.
(laughter)

1300
00:52:42.558 --> 00:52:43.391
Okay.

1301
00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.350
Your neck still has a little crick in it

1302
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:52.300
from how you slept the night before,

1303
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.870
as you sit there and prepare your scry ritual,

1304
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:59.970
here in the warm interior of the elevated,

1305
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.432
attic space.

1306
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.500
You feel a cold breeze pass over your shoulders

1307
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:11.500
as that familiar sense of the Traveler with you.

1308
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:13.560
Leans forward and says,

1309
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.737
"Let's see what she's doing."

1310
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:20.860
Then you feel his hands go over your eyes

1311
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.170
and a darkness peek-a-boo type sensation

1312
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.120
as his fingers pull back.

1313
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.280
You're now looking within a darker cavern.

1314
00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.790
You can see Yasha sitting on her knees,

1315
00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.830
eyes closed, meditating.

1316
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:39.320
Similar to how you are when you scry,

1317
00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.755
but not the same type of ritual.

1318
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.130
You watch over her quietly for a few minutes

1319
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:52.850
and there's a bit of light under her chin.

1320
00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:55.945
A reddish-orange firelight.

1321
00:53:55.945 --> 00:53:57.710
It flickers.

1322
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:59.560
Brighter.

1323
00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.450
And brighter.

1324
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.980
You try and glance under the periphery

1325
00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:07.980
of that scope of the scry position.

1326
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.070
You can see that flame blurred,

1327
00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.830
but growing brighter and brighter

1328
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:16.380
before it manages to flash (whooshing)

1329
00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:23.052
Yasha opens her eyes, you can see the dead stare.

1330
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:26.053
Intense.

1331
00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:30.417
The clenched jaw turns into a grin.

1332
00:54:31.657 --> 00:54:36.110
You see a red skinned hand come out from where the flame was

1333
00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.802
that touches her shoulder,

1334
00:54:38.802 --> 00:54:41.135
and a voice say, "Very good.

1335
00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:44.640
"Thank you for your patience.

1336
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.250
"Now, this has been one fine reunion.

1337
00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.980
"Let's go see if we can find the others."

1338
00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.680
Then he turns around and begins to walk away.

1339
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.790
She stands up and begins to follow.

1340
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:05.530
As the end of the scry spell's length

1341
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.206
begins to peter out, you can hear the

1342
00:55:08.206 --> 00:55:10.456
(thumping)

1343
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:14.860
looming footsteps of the Laughing Hand.

1344
00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.810
At which point, the fingers curl once more around your eyes

1345
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:24.060
and you feel them pull back and you find yourself once more

1346
00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.582
within the store's elevated floor.

1347
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.650
The Traveler, pulling away, just gently whispering,

1348
00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.629
"We should talk, it's been a bit."

1349
00:55:37.629 --> 00:55:39.796
(blowing)

1350
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.550
SAM: Did you see where she was?

1351
00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.987
LAURA: I didn't see where she was.

1352
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.873
TALIESIN: Was it outdoors, indoors?

1353
00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:56.810
LAURA: (tearfully) What if she was bad, you guys,

1354
00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:59.170
what if she was bad the whole time?

1355
00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.950
SAM: I mean...
LAURA: (crying)

1356
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:05.520
TALIESIN: She wasn't.

1357
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.893
SAM: I'm not sure.

1358
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.926
LAURA: She brought him back!

1359
00:56:10.926 --> 00:56:11.759
MARISHA: What?

1360
00:56:11.759 --> 00:56:15.170
LAURA: That guy, Obann, he's back.

1361
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:16.640
He's back.

1362
00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.065
They're going to find their friends or something.

1363
00:56:20.967 --> 00:56:23.059
MARISHA: I give Jester a hug.

1364
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:25.826
LIAM: We don't know.

1365
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.950
There's just too much we don't know,

1366
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:32.690
we did not know her entirely.

1367
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:35.964
Maybe she's beyond saving.

1368
00:56:35.964 --> 00:56:37.914
Jester, we didn't know.

1369
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.350
MARISHA: You sure he's back?

1370
00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:44.722
LAURA: He's back, I saw him.

1371
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.027
He came out of a fire, I don't know, he's--

1372
00:56:52.792 --> 00:56:56.464
LIAM: DM, through reading about history and the arcane,

1373
00:56:56.464 --> 00:57:01.260
would Caleb know if a feller like that

1374
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:04.210
would just be able to respawn like my fae cat?

1375
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:08.167
MATT: I would say from your experience and studies,

1376
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.127
and actually you having some

1377
00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:13.900
religious studies as well for that time.

1378
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.225
Are you trained in, yes you are.

1379
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.340
Certain fiends, usually of considerable power,

1380
00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:27.340
who either are oriented or began

1381
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.080
in one of the various outer planes,

1382
00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.210
whether it be the Abyss, the Nine Hells,

1383
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:34.609
or have become bound to it strongly,

1384
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:38.320
can only truly be killed when on their home plane.

1385
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.240
Otherwise, their death is a temporary convenience.

1386
00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:45.410
When they recorporate on their home plane

1387
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:47.220
and depending on their capabilities,

1388
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:50.270
are able to return relatively quickly.

1389
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:54.180
LIAM: So it's clear that he lost his flesh suit, went home,

1390
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:56.067
and saw when he returned.

1391
00:57:56.067 --> 00:57:56.900
MATT: More or less.

1392
00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.888
LIAM: Based on his story.

1393
00:57:58.888 --> 00:58:01.110
TALIESIN: We didn't actually kill him.

1394
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.450
SAM: Did you see any details of where she was,

1395
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.020
like in the cave, indoors, outdoors?

1396
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.686
LAURA: It was dark.
MATT: It was dark, it looked,

1397
00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:12.470
so there weren't any defining characteristics of it.

1398
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:14.910
It looked familiar, similar to the same location

1399
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:16.940
that you'd been trudging through.

1400
00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.690
From best that you can tell,

1401
00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:20.790
because it looked more earthen and opened,

1402
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:25.320
it wasn't part of the King's Cage interior itself.

1403
00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:27.120
In the time that you were resting for the evening,

1404
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.730
they've traveled nearer to the entrance.

1405
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:32.840
TALIESIN: Oh.

1406
00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.330
LAURA: They're still in the cave, though, I bet.

1407
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:38.305
TALIESIN: Oh, they're coming here.

1408
00:58:38.305 --> 00:58:39.330
SAM: Or something.

1409
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:40.600
TALIESIN: No, they're coming here.

1410
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.030
SAM: Well no, he said--

1411
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:44.830
LAURA: He said he was going to find his friends.

1412
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:46.430
TALIESIN: I know.

1413
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:48.610
They're coming here.

1414
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.220
MARISHA: How do you feel about that authority now?

1415
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.212
TALIESIN: Well, now we have information.

1416
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.370
MARISHA: I've never been one to really respect

1417
00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:58.780
the perspective of authority,

1418
00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:02.081
I've always trusted my own perspective.

1419
00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:03.485
TRAVIS: Think we knew that about you.

1420
00:59:03.485 --> 00:59:04.643
TALIESIN: Which is why I'm so complimented

1421
00:59:04.643 --> 00:59:05.476
that you take the time

1422
00:59:05.476 --> 00:59:07.440
to respect my opinion on the matter.

1423
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.130
MARISHA: I'm trying.

1424
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.230
I'm getting better.

1425
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:11.470
TALIESIN: We now have new information.

1426
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:15.290
SAM: The Bazzoxan, Bazzoxan is connected to,

1427
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.680
mountains that are some sort of temple.

1428
00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.510
MATT: On the mountain range here, the Penumbra Range,

1429
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.260
this northern side of it.

1430
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.820
Bazzoxan is built around

1431
00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.400
what's referred to as the Umbra Gates.

1432
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.260
It was an old temple from the Calamity,

1433
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.490
that was attempted to be retrofitted

1434
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.130
when they were building the city,

1435
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:37.140
and then discovered that elements of its deep interior

1436
00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.350
still had connections to the Abyss.

1437
00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:41.150
TRAVIS: Underground tunnels underneath...

1438
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:43.650
TALIESIN: So they're the main--

1439
00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:44.710
SAM: So they're probably going there.

1440
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:48.127
TALIESIN: The main door is how far away from us right now?

1441
00:59:49.551 --> 00:59:51.640
MATT: From where you are right now in the Ready Room,

1442
00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:56.570
I'd say about close to 1000 feet, if not more?

1443
00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:59.199
SAM: Why don't we go there? Check it out.

1444
00:59:59.199 --> 01:00:00.580
TALIESIN: The door that's about to crack open

1445
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.360
when this thing comes out of it.

1446
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.210
SAM: No no no, what thing?

1447
01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.033
TALIESIN: It's where they're heading. It's the main door.

1448
01:00:06.033 --> 01:00:07.260
SAM: Yes, where they're going to.

1449
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.520
TALIESIN: Is 1000 feet from us right now.

1450
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.270
SAM: Yeah, let's go there and see how,

1451
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.380
let's see how well secured it is.

1452
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.780
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm on board.

1453
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.040
I'm down.

1454
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.190
TALIESIN: I kind of want to tell people to leave,

1455
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:23.470
to be honest.

1456
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.470
SAM: We've seen it, we haven't seen it.

1457
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:26.710
TALIESIN: We did, didn't we?

1458
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.480
MATT: You saw it from a distance,
but you didn't approach it.

1459
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.680
SAM: We haven't been there, we don't know what it is.

1460
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.277
TRAVIS: Big bad that shit under there, big bad shit.

1461
01:00:33.277 --> 01:00:34.877
TALIESIN: That's going to be here any minute.

1462
01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:35.710
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

1463
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:37.318
Well, it'll take a hot second for them to get here.

1464
01:00:37.318 --> 01:00:39.288
TALIESIN: They've been traveling all--

1465
01:00:39.288 --> 01:00:41.610
SAM: No, she just scryed on them, they're still in the cave.

1466
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:43.400
They're five miles away inside the cave.

1467
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.640
LAURA: No no no, the cave probably connects the whole way.

1468
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.763
SAM: That's still five miles away.
TALIESIN: They've been walking.

1469
01:00:50.763 --> 01:00:51.596
SAM: Okay.

1470
01:00:52.509 --> 01:00:53.520
MARISHA: Because there was another passage.

1471
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.390
LAURA: To the doorway.

1472
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:56.250
TRAVIS: I thought it had caved in on one side,

1473
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.580
near the entrance and then--

1474
01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.060
MATT: It caved in and then the other seemed to eventually

1475
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.810
trail off into a very, very extensive slope.

1476
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:04.210
TRAVIS: Oh, we didn't go that way.

1477
01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.764
MATT: No, because it seemed to go beyond a 45 degree angle.

1478
01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:09.419
TRAVIS: Fuck shit balls.

1479
01:01:09.419 --> 01:01:11.620
SAM: So Caduceus, you're saying

1480
01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.790
this thing might come out of this cavern

1481
01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:16.580
and you think we should just run away before it does.

1482
01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.654
TALIESIN: I think it is going to come out of this cavern

1483
01:01:18.654 --> 01:01:20.637
and I'm--
SAM: Don't want to warn anyone?

1484
01:01:20.637 --> 01:01:23.300
TALIESIN: I'm happy to warn people.

1485
01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.690
SAM: You just want to run away.

1486
01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:25.570
TALIESIN: What do you want to do?

1487
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:27.260
SAM: I want to go to see what it is.

1488
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.840
We don't even know what this portal is,

1489
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.310
it could be heavily fortified.

1490
01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:31.610
TALIESIN: It is heavily fortified.

1491
01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.740
SAM: We haven't been there!

1492
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.510
TALIESIN: We've seen it from a distance, but we can go look.

1493
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.660
LAURA: We need to tell them not to

1494
01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.235
puncture the Laughing Hand.

1495
01:01:39.235 --> 01:01:42.410
Not to hit him, or cause him any bodily harm.

1496
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:43.880
MARISHA: Realistically, none of these people should

1497
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.760
probably even fight Obann and the Laughing Hand.

1498
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.690
They should just let them go.

1499
01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:51.240
TRAVIS: Yep.

1500
01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.860
MARISHA: We also don't want to send warnings,

1501
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.960
saying, "Hey, shit's coming,"

1502
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.040
and then send a bunch of soldiers to their death

1503
01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.887
who are under prepared.

1504
01:01:58.887 --> 01:02:01.740
LIAM: This Obann, whoever he is,

1505
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.860
he is a being of significant power,

1506
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:08.040
if he was able to return immediately, almost.

1507
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.040
This is beyond these people's dealing, probably.

1508
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.960
The Bright Queen and her echelons

1509
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.730
should be focusing on this.

1510
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:23.820
I know that it feels wrong to keep these people in the dark,

1511
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.060
but both our relationship with her

1512
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.370
and her ability with us to address the situation

1513
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:34.220
could be compromised in ways that we cannot predict,

1514
01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.000
if we set this place abuzz.

1515
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.870
TRAVIS: So real simple question, okay?

1516
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:41.100
Show of hands.

1517
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.810
Obey the Bright Queen, yes or no?

1518
01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:45.950
No means we go check out the gate,

1519
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:48.540
we go to the kiln, we do anything else, we go back.

1520
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.807
Do we obey the Bright Queen, raise your hand.

1521
01:02:51.807 --> 01:02:53.460
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: It's too big.

1522
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.640
SAM: I don't think that--

1523
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.800
TRAVIS: Majority wins, we're going back.

1524
01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.520
SAM: Sure, we still have a day.

1525
01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.990
We could walk over to the gate and just look at it.

1526
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.890
I don't know why--

1527
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:03.380
TALIESIN: We can walk over, look at it,

1528
01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.060
but I would want to get out of town real quick.

1529
01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.498
TRAVIS: Sure, you think we're coming back?

1530
01:03:07.498 --> 01:03:08.980
LAURA: The gate is right here in the city.

1531
01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.840
SAM: It's 1000 feet away, we can just walk over

1532
01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.673
and just look and then--

1533
01:03:11.673 --> 01:03:13.623
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you meant once it goes.

1534
01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.100
LAURA: No no no, the gate that opens up onto the city

1535
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.580
where they probably will exit and kill everyone in the town.

1536
01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.700
TRAVIS: So let's do it.

1537
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.940
MATT: All right.

1538
01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.420
You guys gather your things,

1539
01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.160
you exit the Ready Room,

1540
01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.510
head out into the warm--

1541
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:28.480
You've all been sweating a bit,

1542
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.150
even this early in the morning, it's uncomfortable.

1543
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:31.330
You head out into the bright sun,

1544
01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:33.777
you can see some of the guards, specifically the drow

1545
01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:37.080
are trying to jump from awning to awning

1546
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.950
to basically just stay out of the light as much as possible.

1547
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:45.820
You do notice that the guard presence is increasing.

1548
01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.870
There is movement.

1549
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:50.390
There are soldiers that are now starting to

1550
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.840
work towards the perimeter of the city.

1551
01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.740
You do see there seems to be a little more liveliness

1552
01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.393
based on the lazier morning

1553
01:03:57.393 --> 01:04:00.513
that you first were keeping an eye on, Fjord.

1554
01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.570
As you approach, you do see

1555
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:05.390
the gargantuan set of black doors,

1556
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:09.340
hewn from dark stone, inlaid with copper and silver details.

1557
01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.160
They're closed, seemingly sealed.

1558
01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.290
The large barricade of steel rigging

1559
01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:17.577
that has been bolted across the entirety of the entryway

1560
01:04:17.577 --> 01:04:20.370
in a large cross, criss-cross.

1561
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:24.306
A smaller temporary entrance is closely guarded to the right

1562
01:04:24.306 --> 01:04:26.800
of this massive, impressive gateway.

1563
01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.700
You can see right now it looks to be probably

1564
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.560
close to three dozen soldiers

1565
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.840
are currently stationed directly around the gate

1566
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.950
in that smaller entranceway.

1567
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:38.828
You can see there are numerous bridges that are bolted up

1568
01:04:38.828 --> 01:04:43.820
that eventually climb up, meeting other very sheer stairways

1569
01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:47.600
that are partially pushing out of the cliff face

1570
01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.914
that meet the base of other portions of the stone

1571
01:04:50.914 --> 01:04:55.364
and rock that then transform into smaller towers,

1572
01:04:55.364 --> 01:04:58.155
portions of this ancient temple that was built within

1573
01:04:58.155 --> 01:04:59.508
the side of this mountain.

1574
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:01.533
As you guys approach,

1575
01:05:01.533 --> 01:05:04.050
you can see soldiers arming up,

1576
01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:07.400
just taking a perimeter on the gate as well.

1577
01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.850
As you begin to walk, one of them you can see is

1578
01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:14.850
a hefty bugbear wearing a breastplate

1579
01:05:15.004 --> 01:05:18.800
adorned similarly to the general Kryn armor designs

1580
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.730
that you're used to seeing approaches and goes,

1581
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:23.140
"Halt, sorry.

1582
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.170
"There's no one close to the gate today."

1583
01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:27.520
LAURA: What's happening at the gate today?

1584
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.512
MATT: "We got word from the Bright Queen to keep an eye."

1585
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:33.400
SAM: There you go.

1586
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.841
LAURA: Oh, okay.

1587
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.780
SAM: Because of danger?

1588
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.370
MATT: "No specifics, but we were notified of

1589
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:46.487
"possible flare-ups and incursions."

1590
01:05:46.487 --> 01:05:47.417
LAURA: All right, all right.

1591
01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:51.290
SAM: When was the last incursion?

1592
01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:54.520
MATT: "Oh, incursions happen almost weekly here."

1593
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.745
LAURA: When did the Bright Ween-- Queen send word?

1594
01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.410
MATT: "I'm uncertain specifically--"

1595
01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:03.028
LAURA: Because I said the Bright Ween. It was funny.

1596
01:06:03.028 --> 01:06:04.140
(laughter)

1597
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.260
MATT: Very different NPC.

1598
01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.415
Her name-- long may he reign.

1599
01:06:08.415 --> 01:06:10.665
(laughter)

1600
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.740
MATT: "I got my orders about maybe a half an hour ago."

1601
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.167
LAURA: Okay okay okay okay.

1602
01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:22.080
Okay.

1603
01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.500
LIAM: Excuse me, I also have a question for you.

1604
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.952
MATT: When you make yourself known, Caleb, the--

1605
01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:30.640
LIAM: Pulling out the necklace as as I say that.

1606
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.473
MATT: Okay.

1607
01:06:31.473 --> 01:06:33.570
The bugbear goes into a defensive stance

1608
01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:35.550
and looks at you with a glare

1609
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:37.420
and then looks over the symbol you hold out

1610
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:41.080
and still remains defensive and untrusting,

1611
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.780
but doesn't seem to make any aggressive action.

1612
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.260
LIAM: Yeah, I know it is highly odd. This happens a lot.

1613
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.118
Just a quick question and we'll be out of your hair.

1614
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:55.220
I imagine people are able to travel here quickly from

1615
01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:59.015
Rosohna, if need be. Do you know of or can you send me to

1616
01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:03.115
anyone to inquire after a

1617
01:07:03.115 --> 01:07:05.690
teleportation circle here.

1618
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:07.910
Does one exist?

1619
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:10.133
MATT: "Not within Bazzoxan, no.

1620
01:07:10.133 --> 01:07:14.735
"Those are usually relegated to the bigger city.

1621
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:18.350
"We're just an outpost these days.

1622
01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:20.212
"My apologies."

1623
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:23.660
And just keeps staring at you,

1624
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.280
confused by both the question and

1625
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.284
what the hell is a human with a Zemnian accent

1626
01:07:29.284 --> 01:07:31.400
holding the symbol of the Bright Queen out here

1627
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.130
in the middle of the Barbed Fields.

1628
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:34.780
TRAVIS: I'll take out my Bright Queen symbol as well,

1629
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.900
and say we are here to assist her in her efforts.

1630
01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.580
She's very useful to us.

1631
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:43.410
I know, not normally welcome, but we mean well.

1632
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.596
MATT: "All right.

1633
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:47.920
"Well, anyway.

1634
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.280
"We have to go about our business.

1635
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.520
"If there's anything-- you see anything funny,

1636
01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.988
"just make sure to tell one of the soldiers nearby."

1637
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:57.543
SAM: Okay.

1638
01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:00.650
TALIESIN: Do you have magical defenses against things

1639
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:04.130
that come out of there, or is it just armed guards?

1640
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:05.770
MATT: "No, we have all sorts of defenses.

1641
01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:09.180
"Not my specialty. I'm more in the infantry units

1642
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.490
"here at the front of the gate, but we have all sorts."

1643
01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:12.323
And he begins to point,

1644
01:08:12.323 --> 01:08:14.448
and you can see now areas where these ladders

1645
01:08:14.448 --> 01:08:17.480
have been situated and bolted in those cliff faces,

1646
01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.730
as he is pointing up in the region

1647
01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:22.760
you can see there are soldiers that have these large,

1648
01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.610
intricate-looking ballista.

1649
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.640
For as far as the weaponry and how it's designed,

1650
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.452
it doesn't appear to be just a standard type of ballista,

1651
01:08:31.452 --> 01:08:36.000
it has some strange, like a blueish crystalline tube

1652
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.580
that is put in towards the front

1653
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.430
and the individuals that are currently manning it are

1654
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:44.400
assembling some sort of ammunition that you don't recognize.

1655
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.533
LIAM: Do they look like Waccoh design?

1656
01:08:48.570 --> 01:08:52.080
MATT: From what you've seen, it could very well be the case.

1657
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.230
MARISHA: About how many men are stationed?

1658
01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:56.220
MATT: Right now since you've arrived,

1659
01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.360
and a few more have come,

1660
01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.290
there're now probably about 40 or so soldiers

1661
01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:01.360
that are right here outside of the gate.

1662
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.400
Including the ones, that's maybe like ten of those?

1663
01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.783
It's 30 at the front,

1664
01:09:04.783 --> 01:09:07.060
and then 10 that are up on the face of the main gate.

1665
01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.680
You don't know how many are further up on the cliff face

1666
01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.510
and there are others that are part of

1667
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:12.720
taking the perimeter around the city,

1668
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.232
as well as a secondary force behind this front line.

1669
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:19.850
TRAVIS: Are we good here?

1670
01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:20.983
TALIESIN: I am.

1671
01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:23.818
SAM: Yes, helpful.

1672
01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:28.430
Guess we'll just go get a drink

1673
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:31.410
and wait out the next 22 hours?

1674
01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:32.910
TALIESIN: I'd like to get on the road.

1675
01:09:34.378 --> 01:09:36.110
TRAVIS: I think we're teleporting.

1676
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.982
LAURA: Yeah.

1677
01:09:36.982 --> 01:09:39.330
TALIESIN: I don't know if I want to spend a day here.

1678
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:42.480
LAURA: What if they come out and then we die anyway?

1679
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.720
SAM: If they come out, Yasha would be with them

1680
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.020
and I would want to be here.

1681
01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.197
LAURA: They come out, we just fight them some more.

1682
01:09:49.197 --> 01:09:50.560
TRAVIS: If they come out, they come out.

1683
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.676
LAURA: They come out. They come out of the doorway.

1684
01:09:53.676 --> 01:09:54.509
TALIESIN: Of course they're going to

1685
01:09:54.509 --> 01:09:55.342
come out of the doorway.

1686
01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.709
LAURA: And we kick their ass.

1687
01:09:57.709 --> 01:10:00.340
TALIESIN: That's not...

1688
01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.857
SAM: There's a chance that we could grab Yasha and run,

1689
01:10:02.857 --> 01:10:04.106
if there was a melee.

1690
01:10:04.106 --> 01:10:06.160
MARISHA: But she's not Yasha anymore.

1691
01:10:07.094 --> 01:10:07.927
TALIESIN: All right now--

1692
01:10:07.927 --> 01:10:09.207
MARISHA: We have to stop referring to her

1693
01:10:09.207 --> 01:10:13.860
like she hasn't become something else.

1694
01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.460
TALIESIN: Getting her back is going to require

1695
01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.385
more than just grabbing her.

1696
01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:21.352
LAURA: Right now, she is definitely the Orphan Maker.

1697
01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:26.032
TALIESIN: Right now, it's just a...

1698
01:10:27.628 --> 01:10:30.013
It's just a death trap.

1699
01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.837
I think we've got to leave.

1700
01:10:33.837 --> 01:10:37.000
If we've any hope of saving her, we got to leave.

1701
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.240
TRAVIS: We can't get there any faster, right?

1702
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.400
Caleb, you're not--

1703
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.220
you can't do your thing till tomorrow, right?

1704
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.056
LIAM: No, I need to study.

1705
01:10:45.056 --> 01:10:46.310
I'm sorry.

1706
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:47.600
TRAVIS: No no.

1707
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.633
TALIESIN: Well, I think if we're here,

1708
01:10:48.633 --> 01:10:49.658
I think they're going to attack.

1709
01:10:49.658 --> 01:10:53.215
They're going to see us and we're going to become a target.

1710
01:10:54.571 --> 01:10:55.720
LAURA: Maybe you should just, you know,

1711
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:58.060
stick that dagger or something in the doorway there

1712
01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.020
and then we can leave.

1713
01:10:59.020 --> 01:10:59.853
SAM: Sure.

1714
01:10:59.853 --> 01:11:01.400
LAURA: Give a little extra protection or something.

1715
01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.246
SAM: Seems like there's more than one door, right?

1716
01:11:03.246 --> 01:11:04.760
There's a big door and then a small door.

1717
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.920
TALIESIN: Probably just--

1718
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.320
MATT: The small door is more of an entryway that's guarded.

1719
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.980
You don't see an actual door,

1720
01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.393
though you're not sure if there's one further in.

1721
01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:13.880
It's mostly blocked off,

1722
01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.560
from what you can see from this distance.

1723
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.250
The large door, and it's two heavy, heavy doors,

1724
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:23.690
standing about, I'd say close to 30 feet tall,

1725
01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:25.015
bottom to top.

1726
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:29.020
There's detailing in the sculpture on the doors.

1727
01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.810
You see a scene of somewhat abstract action,

1728
01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:34.530
like shapes comprised of bones and faces,

1729
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:38.310
and creature-like forms ranging from human to animal,

1730
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:41.260
all twisted across the surface.

1731
01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.830
Looks like a sizable chunk of this bottom region

1732
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:45.530
has been defaced and chiseled away,

1733
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:47.100
like an attempt to remove a design

1734
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.220
left abandoned, partially.

1735
01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.937
TRAVIS: Any sort of imagery that we would recognize?

1736
01:11:51.937 --> 01:11:54.037
MATT: You can make an arcana or religion check.

1737
01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.474
TALIESIN: I'll get in on that.

1738
01:11:56.474 --> 01:11:58.724
TRAVIS: Me, too.
LAURA: Doo doe, doo doe.

1739
01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:03.130
(laughter)

1740
01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:04.117
TALIESIN: 10.
LIAM: 25 arcana.

1741
01:12:04.117 --> 01:12:05.328
LAURA: One!

1742
01:12:05.328 --> 01:12:06.161
TRAVIS: 15.

1743
01:12:07.088 --> 01:12:07.921
MATT: What did you get then, Caleb?

1744
01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:08.754
SAM: 25.

1745
01:12:08.754 --> 01:12:10.930
MATT: 25, all right.

1746
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:12.140
Fjord and Caleb.

1747
01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.490
TALIESIN: Wow.

1748
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:16.210
MATT: You guys recognize that the depiction of this door

1749
01:12:16.210 --> 01:12:19.120
represents a demon lord from the Abyss,

1750
01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.400
specifically the massive bestial body

1751
01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.757
of the Horned King, Baphomet.

1752
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:27.720
He appears to be walking along a broken land,

1753
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.500
an army of malformed creatures swarming around him.

1754
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.390
A long, snakelike creature borders the doors

1755
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.140
with a single arm protruding from the right side,

1756
01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.780
just above the ruined portion of the relief

1757
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.020
where it's all broken and carved away

1758
01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:42.232
in a 15-foot section, end to end.

1759
01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:45.681
TRAVIS: (whimper) No. Oh fucking shit.

1760
01:12:45.681 --> 01:12:50.670
LIAM: Do we know any more detail on Baphomet?

1761
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:56.640
Other than that's who this is depicted.

1762
01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.870
MATT: I mean, as one of the demon lords,

1763
01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:02.560
generally the master of beasts

1764
01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.600
and beast form demons and such,

1765
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.730
I can give you a more detailed run-down later via email.

1766
01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:10.000
Yeah, give you some more-- with a 25,

1767
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.570
you get a little more of a rundown on that,

1768
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:12.820
so I'll send that to you.

1769
01:13:13.898 --> 01:13:15.140
TRAVIS: Can I propose something?

1770
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.410
MATT: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Yeah!

1771
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:18.160
TRAVIS: If we can't teleport until tomorrow,

1772
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.780
and as much as we would love to get on the road,

1773
01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.338
it's not going to close the distance that much more.

1774
01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.800
If these poor fucks are actually going to be

1775
01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.290
on the other side of this door when that shit comes through,

1776
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:32.640
I would at least like to tell them to run

1777
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.920
or not cut into the thing or whatever.

1778
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.902
Maybe nothing happens and maybe we stay.

1779
01:13:36.902 --> 01:13:39.210
Maybe we just need to see what plays out either way.

1780
01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.410
We should stay here until we're ready to go in the morning

1781
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:43.800
and just see what happens.

1782
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.220
Best case scenario, nothing does,

1783
01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.310
and we're out lickety-split.

1784
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:48.970
We're going back to the Bright Queen and seeing what's what.

1785
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.998
But if it comes through, we could save lives.

1786
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:57.800
LIAM: What if, then, as a compromise,

1787
01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.907
one of us, yourself,

1788
01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.880
who are good at disguising ourselves.

1789
01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.340
You are the perfect choice

1790
01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.402
because of your knack for accents.

1791
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.960
Slip into the barracks and disguise as one of the guards.

1792
01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:18.160
Or whatever shithole passes as a tavern here.

1793
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.460
You spread the rumor

1794
01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:25.460
that this is the big one, the worst that you've heard of.

1795
01:14:25.559 --> 01:14:29.298
Then that way, it just starts among the soldiers here.

1796
01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:31.920
TRAVIS: I'd be okay with that.

1797
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.880
LAURA: A whisper campaign.

1798
01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.850
SAM: We're good at those!

1799
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.390
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Worked last time.

1800
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:38.200
LAURA: Totally, every time it's always worked.

1801
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.033
SAM: Oh, were you around?

1802
01:14:39.033 --> 01:14:41.120
TALIESIN: I probably was, I just don't remember.

1803
01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.488
(laughter)

1804
01:14:42.488 --> 01:14:44.789
SAM: We said there was ghosts on the pier.

1805
01:14:44.789 --> 01:14:45.886
TALIESIN: There were ghosts on the pier?

1806
01:14:45.886 --> 01:14:48.200
LAURA: Oh that's-- yeah.

1807
01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.360
TALIESIN: Haunted pier.
LAURA: Yeah.

1808
01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.808
Yeah, you want to do it, Fjord?

1809
01:14:51.808 --> 01:14:53.700
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd be fine with that.

1810
01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.660
TALIESIN: Miss that haunted pier.

1811
01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.690
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Okay, so--

1812
01:14:56.690 --> 01:14:58.040
SAM: Is there a tavern around?

1813
01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.473
MATT: There...

1814
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:05.426
is...

1815
01:15:05.426 --> 01:15:06.949
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1816
01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:08.430
LAURA: (sighs) I feel like I'm going to throw up.

1817
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:10.200
MATT: Actually, the closest thing there is to a tavern

1818
01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.530
in this vicinity is the Ready Room.

1819
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:13.310
Aside from the actual military barracks itself.

1820
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:14.470
Like, most of this city--

1821
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:16.117
TALIESIN: Worst town ever.

1822
01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:17.747
MATT: It's pretty rough.

1823
01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:20.020
TRAVIS: This thing's about to be wiped from the bucket list.

1824
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.550
TALIESIN: This is Blythe, California.

1825
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:24.330
For the three viewers in Blythe, I apologize,

1826
01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:25.680
you have one good restaurant

1827
01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.620
and you know you've only got one good restaurant.

1828
01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.842
MARISHA: I have a terrible feeling about this.

1829
01:15:28.842 --> 01:15:30.630
SAM: Do we want to go in the barracks then?

1830
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:33.420
TALIESIN: I know I got caught there once.

1831
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:37.194
TRAVIS: If you want me to meet you back in the tav--

1832
01:15:37.194 --> 01:15:40.530
the Ready Room, I'll be back in just a bit.

1833
01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:41.910
SAM: I think we want to stay around here

1834
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:44.685
in case we see some action, right?

1835
01:15:44.685 --> 01:15:46.278
TRAVIS: I'll find my way back.

1836
01:15:46.278 --> 01:15:48.402
LAURA: Just sit here in the road.

1837
01:15:49.306 --> 01:15:50.139
MATT: You guys are taking the day,

1838
01:15:50.139 --> 01:15:52.110
just keeping an eye on the--

1839
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:53.300
SAM: Yeah.

1840
01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.837
MATT: The Umbra Gates and the whole

1841
01:15:54.837 --> 01:15:57.310
Penumbra Range visage before you.

1842
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:59.901
LAURA: Set up a sad little picnic on the side

1843
01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:01.167
of the road.

1844
01:16:01.167 --> 01:16:03.858
MATT and LAURA: The saddest little Jester picnic.

1845
01:16:03.858 --> 01:16:06.130
TRAVIS: We have our medallions, we know Professor Waccoh

1846
01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:08.550
and maybe we can find out what that munition is

1847
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:10.120
they're using.

1848
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.800
SAM: Kay.
TRAVIS: Just in case that helps.

1849
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.885
SAM: You want to go ask around?

1850
01:16:13.885 --> 01:16:15.450
LAURA: Uh, sure.

1851
01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.650
Should I be a soldier, too?

1852
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:19.758
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Okay.

1853
01:16:20.946 --> 01:16:21.779
I'll do that, too.

1854
01:16:21.779 --> 01:16:24.400
I'll find a place to hide and turn into a soldier.

1855
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.940
MATT: Okay.

1856
01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.773
TRAVIS: Same.

1857
01:16:26.773 --> 01:16:30.000
SAM: I'm going to go looking for crossbow bolts.

1858
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:30.833
MATT: Okay.

1859
01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:31.740
SAM: Because I have eight.

1860
01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.070
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

1861
01:16:34.296 --> 01:16:36.580
MARISHA: I want to stay looking at the gate,

1862
01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.670
but also pay attention to the weather.

1863
01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:40.986
MATT: Got it. Good to know, okay.

1864
01:16:40.986 --> 01:16:42.200
Taking this in order,

1865
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.810
you're going for your search for crossbow bolts.

1866
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:47.150
Go ahead and make a stealth check.

1867
01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:49.790
SAM: Stealth. I'm not trying to steal them, though.

1868
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:51.657
MATT: Oh, okay.
SAM: I'm trying to go buy them.

1869
01:16:51.657 --> 01:16:53.327
TALIESIN: Whoa!
MATT: Okay, I misunderstood.

1870
01:16:53.327 --> 01:16:54.247
TALIESIN: New character development!

1871
01:16:54.247 --> 01:16:56.940
(laughter)

1872
01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.320
MATT: I apologize for assuming.

1873
01:16:59.270 --> 01:17:00.760
SAM: I would steal them if I knew,

1874
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.220
I don't even know where to go that they would have it.

1875
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:05.590
LAURA: I'm going to steal them, I just need to.

1876
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:07.810
MATT: Well, the Ready Room, when you were there last.

1877
01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:09.730
Like the upper floor is a makeshift hostel.

1878
01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:11.430
The lower floor is a massive general store.

1879
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:13.800
It's like a warehouse that's comprised as like a,

1880
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.980
whatever you need, we got it, kind of a feel.

1881
01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.400
LAURA: Oh, right, for very expensive prices.

1882
01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.995
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Well, varying.

1883
01:17:20.995 --> 01:17:22.120
They do have crossbow bolts for sale

1884
01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:22.953
if you want to purchase them.

1885
01:17:22.953 --> 01:17:23.830
SAM: I'll just go buy some.

1886
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:25.046
MATT: Okay.

1887
01:17:25.046 --> 01:17:26.130
TALIESIN: (hiccups)

1888
01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:27.440
MATT: Hello.

1889
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.273
Mmm.

1890
01:17:28.273 --> 01:17:30.653
TALIESIN: That's exactly the sound he makes, too.

1891
01:17:30.653 --> 01:17:32.988
MATT: It breaks stealth every time.

1892
01:17:32.988 --> 01:17:35.930
Okay, so just looking real fast for crossbow bolts.

1893
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:37.396
LAURA: I renamed it.

1894
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.610
MATT: Bolts...

1895
01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:41.760
SAM: Oh no, I have five left.

1896
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.445
MATT: Oh, shit.

1897
01:17:44.445 --> 01:17:48.250
I'm going to say just for the sake of...

1898
01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:50.610
There we go, I found it, I found it!

1899
01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:53.783
We'll say for 20 of them, it's two gold.

1900
01:17:53.783 --> 01:17:54.800
SAM: I'll take 80.

1901
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.633
MATT: There you go.

1902
01:17:55.633 --> 01:17:58.520
LAURA: That's right, it's the Ruddy Poon now.

1903
01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.770
TRAVIS: The Ruddy Poon?

1904
01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:02.010
LAURA: Yeah, I changed the name on the sign, remember?

1905
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:04.070
MATT: Yep, and I do not believe anybody has noticed

1906
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:05.703
or has taken the time to--

1907
01:18:05.703 --> 01:18:07.003
SAM and TRAVIS: Or cares.

1908
01:18:07.003 --> 01:18:10.216
(laughter)

1909
01:18:10.216 --> 01:18:11.804
TRAVIS: I do like that name better.

1910
01:18:11.804 --> 01:18:13.660
(laughter)

1911
01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.493
MATT: All right.

1912
01:18:15.776 --> 01:18:17.725
All right, perception check for you.

1913
01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:19.306
If you don't mind, Beauregard.

1914
01:18:19.306 --> 01:18:20.789
MARISHA: Yeah? See what happens.

1915
01:18:20.789 --> 01:18:21.780
Perception check?

1916
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:22.613
MATT: Yes.

1917
01:18:22.613 --> 01:18:25.310
MARISHA: Oh, it was almost a natural 20.

1918
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:26.143
11.

1919
01:18:26.143 --> 01:18:27.880
MATT: Okay, so 11 will be you're keeping a watch

1920
01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:31.010
on both the weather and just the general front of the gate.

1921
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:33.290
TALIESIN: Oh, that's true.

1922
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:34.220
MATT: Jester.
LAURA: Yes.

1923
01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.620
MATT: What are you doing?

1924
01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:39.429
LAURA: I'm going to look like, are there any,

1925
01:18:39.429 --> 01:18:41.270
there's no goblins here, it's what,

1926
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:42.789
it's mostly drow and what?

1927
01:18:42.789 --> 01:18:43.780
MARISHA: (sneezes)

1928
01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:44.680
MATT: Bless you.

1929
01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.390
Actually, there are,

1930
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:49.600
in spending an hour or so looking over the populace,

1931
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.780
there are, maybe a dozen or so goblins out of the,

1932
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.930
you know, I'll say couple hundred people

1933
01:18:55.930 --> 01:18:57.220
that you've seen over the past hour.

1934
01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.150
LAURA: I feel like that would be--

1935
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.240
MATT: So they're present, but they're not, you know.

1936
01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.906
LAURA: They're not common.
MATT: Not primary.

1937
01:19:01.906 --> 01:19:03.770
LAURA: I'm just going to make myself into a drow.

1938
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:04.690
MATT: Okay.

1939
01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:05.800
LAURA: Dude.

1940
01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.420
Do I see any female soldiers?

1941
01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.253
MATT: Yeah.

1942
01:19:08.253 --> 01:19:09.680
LAURA: Okay, then I'll stay as a chick.

1943
01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.620
MATT: Okay.

1944
01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.000
LAURA: Then I'll just have the regular armor on.

1945
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.150
You know, like a couple, I'm going to braid my hair,

1946
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:18.483
it's going to be white.

1947
01:19:18.483 --> 01:19:19.960
MATT: Okay.

1948
01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.160
LAURA: Okay, and then I'm going to go

1949
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.670
towards the ballista thingies.

1950
01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:25.503
MATT: Okay.

1951
01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:27.453
You approach,

1952
01:19:27.453 --> 01:19:29.700
there's a ladder that leads up to one of them.

1953
01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.890
One of the first ones that you saw.

1954
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:32.890
It's about a 20 or so foot climb

1955
01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:34.420
to the platform that it's affixed to.

1956
01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.610
LAURA: Is there anybody on the ground, or is it--

1957
01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:39.440
MATT: There are two soldiers
flanking the sides of the ladder.

1958
01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.830
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to walk up to them.

1959
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:42.663
MATT: Okay.

1960
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.040
LAURA: Oh, hello!

1961
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.390
I see we've got our ballistas ready.

1962
01:19:52.784 --> 01:19:55.890
MATT: "We have them prepared, yes."

1963
01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:58.810
LAURA: From good old Waccoh?

1964
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.690
MATT: They look at each other.

1965
01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:07.305
"And you are?"

1966
01:20:07.305 --> 01:20:08.288
LAURA: Odd.

1967
01:20:08.288 --> 01:20:11.483
(laughter)

1968
01:20:11.483 --> 01:20:13.520
TRAVIS: Oh no!

1969
01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.250
MATT: Their eyes narrow in your direction.

1970
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.170
TRAVIS: Pick it up!

1971
01:20:17.170 --> 01:20:18.341
LAURA: I'm sorry!

1972
01:20:18.341 --> 01:20:21.310
TRAVIS: Pick it up!

1973
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:23.010
LAURA: Nancy McFancypants.

1974
01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:25.530
SAM: Mm. Mm-hmm.

1975
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:28.280
Seems like a real name.

1976
01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.020
MATT: "Pronounced McFancypants?"

1977
01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.630
LAURA: Family, uh, family came from the far east.

1978
01:20:38.282 --> 01:20:39.990
MATT: "Where do you,

1979
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:43.240
"where do you hold your position in this soldier brigade?"

1980
01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:49.003
LAURA: Uh, I just transferred here from--

1981
01:20:49.003 --> 01:20:52.840
from Rosohna, actually.

1982
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.940
MATT: Make a deception check.

1983
01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:55.975
LAURA: Jesus.
TALIESIN: Oh man.

1984
01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:00.300
LAURA: Wow, that was actually surprisingly good!

1985
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.420
21!

1986
01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:03.661
MATT: Really?

1987
01:21:03.661 --> 01:21:08.036
(laughter)

1988
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:13.542
They both seem less on guard and more like just,

1989
01:21:13.542 --> 01:21:16.120
confused and probably a little bit sad

1990
01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.220
that your name happens to be what it is.

1991
01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:24.220
In an empathetic brow furrow

1992
01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:27.100
makes its way in your direction.

1993
01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.250
"Well yes, these are our,

1994
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.458
"these are Waccoh's designs, yes."

1995
01:21:32.328 --> 01:21:34.880
LAURA: What do they do again?

1996
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.655
I just transferred, I don't know anything.

1997
01:21:38.658 --> 01:21:39.491
MATT: "As far as I know,

1998
01:21:39.491 --> 01:21:43.132
"they are partially

1999
01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:44.973
"constructed from something

2000
01:21:44.973 --> 01:21:49.350
"they recovered up north, in Eiselcross."

2001
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:51.770
LAURA: That's pretty- oh.

2002
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:56.210
I think that's a pretty magical place.

2003
01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:58.780
MATT: "Yeah, it's...

2004
01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:02.700
"It prevents or provides its own ammunition.

2005
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:05.266
"It shoots variations of

2006
01:22:05.266 --> 01:22:08.591
arcane attacks."

2007
01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:10.500
LAURA: She's really smart.

2008
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.333
MATT: "That's what they tell me.

2009
01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:12.650
"I have not met her in person, but--"

2010
01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:14.180
LAURA: I have.

2011
01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:18.310
She's got one tusk that goes straight into.

2012
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:19.720
MATT: "Interesting.

2013
01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.140
"So can we help you?"

2014
01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:25.380
LAURA: Oh yeah, I was supposed to operate it.

2015
01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:27.850
But you know, if you don't want me to or something,

2016
01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:29.400
I understand.

2017
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:32.900
MATT: "We are..."

2018
01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.379
Make another deception check.

2019
01:22:34.379 --> 01:22:37.240
(laughter)

2020
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.681
LAURA: Oh no, that one's real bad.

2021
01:22:38.681 --> 01:22:42.204
TRAVIS: -- you're trying to fly the jet.

2022
01:22:42.204 --> 01:22:43.345
LAURA: Eight?

2023
01:22:43.345 --> 01:22:45.711
MATT: He goes, "Uh,

2024
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:50.110
"while I appreciate your enthusiasm,

2025
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:54.870
"we have been assigned to handle this particular ballista.

2026
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:58.550
"However, word is to keep a close eye on the perimeter,

2027
01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:00.390
"so perhaps you are better used

2028
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:02.950
"maybe on the eastern bank of Bazzoxan."

2029
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:05.340
LAURA: Perimeter, you got it.

2030
01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.950
MATT: "Of course, McFancypants."

2031
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:12.160
LAURA: See you in the battle, that's probably coming.

2032
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.010
Seriously though, be careful, you guys,

2033
01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:16.335
because it could be bad and stuff.

2034
01:23:16.335 --> 01:23:18.185
MATT: Of course. It always is.

2035
01:23:18.185 --> 01:23:19.285
LAURA: All right!

2036
01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:22.876
Don't shoot anything with a bunch of mouths,

2037
01:23:22.876 --> 01:23:23.951
okay, goodbye!

2038
01:23:23.951 --> 01:23:25.820
(laughter)

2039
01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:29.100
MATT: As you turn around, you can hear behind you go,

2040
01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.113
"Who the fuck was that?"

2041
01:23:32.113 --> 01:23:35.983
"I don't know, but I'm far too sober for this."

2042
01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:40.670
LAURA: I learned so much.

2043
01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:42.420
SAM: Yes, you did.

2044
01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.145
MATT: All righty.

2045
01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.350
Caduceus, you doing anything?

2046
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:48.450
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, I'm doing a couple things.

2047
01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:51.632
I'm actually, if I've got a minute.

2048
01:23:51.632 --> 01:23:54.070
I'm going to cast Legend Lore.

2049
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:55.430
MATT: Legend Lore, okay.

2050
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.370
On what?

2051
01:23:57.370 --> 01:24:00.150
TALIESIN: That ridiculous two pieces of sword that I have.

2052
01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:02.210
MATT: Oh, okay, do you have the material components for it?

2053
01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:03.521
TALIESIN: Yes I do.

2054
01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:06.404
It's a lot of weird ivory and--

2055
01:24:06.404 --> 01:24:09.630
MATT: Okay, let me get out my notes on this one.

2056
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:13.150
TALIESIN: Ivory and weird bits--

2057
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.730
incense I had to pick up for that.

2058
01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:16.563
MATT: Okay.

2059
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.200
Where are you going to do this ritual?

2060
01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.070
TALIESIN: I see all of this happening.

2061
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:23.230
I'm going to go back up into the room for a minute,

2062
01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:25.290
sit down, set up,

2063
01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:28.060
make a little setup, put the sword in front of me,

2064
01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.930
and maybe hopefully get a glimpse

2065
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:31.480
as to what I'm supposed to do next.

2066
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.350
I have some theories

2067
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:34.280
and I just want to see if I'm on the right track.

2068
01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.090
MATT: Okay, you go ahead and get partway through it

2069
01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:40.350
and you hear, climbing up the ladder

2070
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:41.320
that leads to the second point,

2071
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.190
you see this middle aged, big bushy bearded orc

2072
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:47.700
comes up and goes,

2073
01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.823
"You look like you're in the middle of something."

2074
01:24:50.823 --> 01:24:52.189
TALIESIN: Thaumaturgy,

2075
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:55.220
I'm going to turn in just the blackest eyes.

2076
01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.170
MATT: "I'm going to leave you to it."

2077
01:24:57.170 --> 01:24:59.980
He just like slowly leaves the chamber.

2078
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.305
TALIESIN: Close doors.

2079
01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.760
(laughter)

2080
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.450
MATT: The hatch (whooshes) slaps over.

2081
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:08.740
All right.

2082
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:11.180
As you complete the ritual, the smell of the incense

2083
01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:14.756
mingling with this sweat-dried wood

2084
01:25:14.756 --> 01:25:17.530
around you on the floor here.

2085
01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:20.950
It fills your nose, your eyes sting,

2086
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:22.850
and the warmth overtakes you,

2087
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:24.850
not the heat but the warmth.

2088
01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:27.600
A familiar comfort.

2089
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.020
At which point you don't hear a voice,

2090
01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:35.632
but a series of images and emotions convey

2091
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:39.940
what seems like a montage of moments

2092
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.040
through time, through history.

2093
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.640
The best that you can,

2094
01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:49.240
that your brain, that your mind can interpret these images,

2095
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:54.240
say: "This blade was once known as Dwueth'var,

2096
01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.037
"the Star Razor."

2097
01:25:58.037 --> 01:26:00.270
LAURA: Write it down, write it down!

2098
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:02.710
MATT: You can see the blade now before you

2099
01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:04.240
set upon a stone tablet,

2100
01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.140
glowing with runes across the center of it.

2101
01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:12.060
"A weapon forged through a union of two acolytes

2102
01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.370
"of Melora and Sehanine,

2103
01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:16.380
"during the Age of Arcanum.

2104
01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.270
"It carries the blessing of the fiercest full moon

2105
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:21.530
"and starlit night.

2106
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:24.735
"Recovered by the elves and dwarves of Uthodurn,

2107
01:26:24.735 --> 01:26:28.300
"it was reforged and strengthened under the skilled work

2108
01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.720
"of the dwarven smith, Dulgrim Smeltborne,

2109
01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.290

01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:36.830

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.072
"within the Savalirwood.

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:43.310
"The pieces have since been recovered as historical relics,

01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:47.300
"trading hands through traveling merchants and smugglers

2114
01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:51.710
"and lost through time."

2115
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.770
TALIESIN: Until now.

2116
01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:56.537
MATT: At that point, the visions subside.

2117
01:26:58.575 --> 01:26:59.569
TRAVIS: That'll do.

2118
01:26:59.569 --> 01:27:01.036
MARISHA: Yeah.

2119
01:27:01.036 --> 01:27:03.203
TALIESIN: We're going to the kiln.

2120
01:27:04.305 --> 01:27:07.207
(whispering)

2121
01:27:07.207 --> 01:27:08.396
Going to the kiln.

2122
01:27:08.396 --> 01:27:10.225
TRAVIS: Savalirwood.

2123
01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:11.929
MARISHA: Elves of Uthadorn?

2124
01:27:11.929 --> 01:27:13.050
TRAVIS: Uthodurn.

2125
01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:15.660
MATT: The Savalirwood is the forest in which you grew up.

2126
01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.930
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Oh.

2127
01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:18.165
MATT: In the Greying Wildlands.

2128
01:27:18.165 --> 01:27:18.998
LAURA: Oh!

2129
01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:22.215
It's meant for you.

2130
01:27:22.215 --> 01:27:23.595
TALIESIN: I don't think it's meant for me.

2131
01:27:23.595 --> 01:27:25.836
LAURA: It's maybe meant for somebody else.

2132
01:27:25.836 --> 01:27:28.290
(laughter)

2133
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:31.379
LAURA: I don't, don't, don't.

2134
01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:33.331
Dwueth'var, Dwueth'var?

2135
01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:34.290
TALIESIN: I'm going to be the jerk who just

2136
01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:36.425
watches the playback on Monday and then writes it down.

2137
01:27:36.425 --> 01:27:39.103
LAURA: Actually, that's smarter.

2138
01:27:39.103 --> 01:27:40.740
I'm going to be the jerk that just looks at CritRoleStats.

2139
01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.573
MATT: Here, I'll spell it for you

2140
01:27:41.573 --> 01:27:43.680
because I'm sure people will want clarification as well,

2141
01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.763
D-W-U-E-T-H,

2142
01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:49.788
apostrophe V-A-R,

2143
01:27:49.788 --> 01:27:51.010
because that's how Elvish works.

2144
01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:53.084
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yeah!

2145
01:27:53.084 --> 01:27:55.290
TRAVIS: V-A-R?

2146
01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:59.360
MATT: D-W-U-E-T-H, apostrophe, V-A-R.

2147
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.837
TRAVIS: V as in Viktor.
LAURA: Yes.

2148
01:28:00.837 --> 01:28:02.520
SAM: I'm pretty sure I'm still spelling it wrong.

2149
01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.273
MATT: That's fine.

2150
01:28:04.273 --> 01:28:06.222
Dwueth'var, the Star Razor.

2151
01:28:06.222 --> 01:28:07.880
SAM: Great.
LAURA: Yeah.

2152
01:28:09.236 --> 01:28:10.850
MATT: Your ritual is complete.

2153
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:14.074
TALIESIN: That was an expensive thing but it was worth it.

2154
01:28:14.074 --> 01:28:15.130
LAURA: Did you just use your 5th-level?

2155
01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:17.110
TALIESIN: Yep, that was my 5th-level.

2156
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:18.108
SAM: Worth it.

2157
01:28:18.108 --> 01:28:19.140
TALIESIN: Yep.

2158
01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:22.083
MATT: All righty.

2159
01:28:22.083 --> 01:28:22.916
TALIESIN: That was so expensive.

2160
01:28:22.916 --> 01:28:24.410
LAURA: I'm going to make my way back to Beau.

2161
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:25.770
MATT: Okay.

2162
01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:26.603
LAURA: Beau.

2163
01:28:26.603 --> 01:28:27.600
MARISHA: What happened?

2164
01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.690
LAURA: I did such a bad job.

2165
01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:31.720
I mean, I learned that that thing was like, okay,

2166
01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.800
it was Waccoh, yeah,

2167
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.830
and it uses magical ammunition

2168
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.600
and they got the supplies from the north

2169
01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.810
which I think is interesting,

2170
01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:42.100
that's where we want to go for the kiln, right?

2171
01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.630
So isn't it supposed to be like some place really like--

2172
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:46.733
MARISHA: Maybe super magical or something.

2173
01:28:46.733 --> 01:28:48.780
The elves live there, right?

2174
01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:50.880
LAURA: Yeah, maybe it's elven or something.

2175
01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.650
MARISHA: Yeah, that's interesting.

2176
01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:53.750
But what do you mean you did bad?

2177
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:54.760
LAURA: Like I don't know,

2178
01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.860
like I was all over the place with my accent,

2179
01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.108
Fjord would've been so disappointed in me.

2180
01:28:59.108 --> 01:29:00.740
(laughter)

2181
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:01.573
MARISHA: Well--

2182
01:29:01.573 --> 01:29:02.710
LAURA: Like I could see it in their face,

2183
01:29:02.710 --> 01:29:07.030
and then I almost said my name was Drowy McFancypants

2184
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:09.070
and then I realized that I shouldn't say

2185
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:11.046
and so I said Nancy?

2186
01:29:11.046 --> 01:29:12.730
(laughter)

2187
01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:14.271
TRAVIS: Drowy?

2188
01:29:14.271 --> 01:29:16.713
LAURA: That was seriously what I--

2189
01:29:16.713 --> 01:29:20.560
MARISHA: Wait, but you still kept the McFancypants part,

2190
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.999
you were Nancy McFancypants?

2191
01:29:21.999 --> 01:29:23.567
(laughter)

2192
01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:24.400
Is that what it was?
TALIESIN: Oh my god,

2193
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.600
it's so much better when you say it.

2194
01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.890
LAURA: Wait, is the McFancypants part the bad part,

2195
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:29.560
I thought Nancy was.

2196
01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.170
MARISHA: Oh, I don't...

2197
01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:33.900
You know, is there a long lineage

2198
01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:35.720
of Fancypants in the region?

2199
01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.240
LAURA: I don't know, that's always just the name

2200
01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.688
that I went with, is that not?

2201
01:29:39.688 --> 01:29:41.980
Maybe I should not go with that one.

2202
01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.625
MARISHA: I feel like I had a clown come to my birthday once

2203
01:29:44.625 --> 01:29:47.810
that was named something McFancypants,

2204
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:48.920
so I don't know.

2205
01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.048
LAURA: So it's been said before?

2206
01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:55.470
MARISHA: By no one taken seriously.

2207
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:56.303
LAURA: Oh.

2208
01:29:56.303 --> 01:30:01.303
MARISHA: But it's been a long week.

2209
01:30:01.519 --> 01:30:02.352
LAURA: It has.

2210
01:30:02.352 --> 01:30:04.750
MARISHA: And you shouldn't be hard on yourself,

2211
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:07.310
and you especially shouldn't be hard on yourself

2212
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:08.990
for not doing accents.

2213
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:11.960
You know, like Fjord's thing.

2214
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.855
All these accents.
LIAM: Those are hard.

2215
01:30:13.855 --> 01:30:16.290
MARISHA: They are, you know.

2216
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:18.340
You have amazing other qualities to your voice

2217
01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:21.811
that are very unique.

2218
01:30:21.811 --> 01:30:23.270
LAURA: Thank you?

2219
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:24.103
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

2220
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:28.800
You did fine.

2221
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.633
LAURA: Thanks, Beau.

2222
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:35.207
MARISHA: Now also, you know you don't...

2223
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:41.050
You don't need Fjord's approval to be amazing,

2224
01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.030
right, you know you're great, right?

2225
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:47.030
Do you need his validation?

2226
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:50.457
LAURA: Well, no, no.

2227
01:30:50.457 --> 01:30:54.257
It's just you know, it's like if I punched somebody

2228
01:30:54.257 --> 01:30:56.600
and I did like a really good job,

2229
01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.480
I would look at you

2230
01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.320
and I would want you to think it was good.

2231
01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.153
MARISHA: Sure.

2232
01:31:01.153 --> 01:31:02.180
LAURA: Or if I did a really bad job,

2233
01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:04.090
I would hope you didn't see because you know,

2234
01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:08.158
you're really good at punching people.

2235
01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:10.270
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, that's--

2236
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:12.069
LAURA: I mean, you're good at a lot of other things too,

2237
01:31:12.069 --> 01:31:14.320
Beau. That's just the, you know you're like (growls)

2238
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.712
you're really good at punching things.

2239
01:31:15.712 --> 01:31:17.710
MARISHA: Oh, I'm super proud that punching things

2240
01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:19.370
is pretty much my best asset.

2241
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:20.690
Yeah.
(laughter)

2242
01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:23.455
No, that was a deep compliment, thank you.

2243
01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:25.848
Yeah, you just...

2244
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:30.822
The reason our group works is because we're each

2245
01:31:30.822 --> 01:31:35.108
really good at different things.

2246
01:31:35.108 --> 01:31:35.941
LAURA: Yeah.

2247
01:31:35.941 --> 01:31:37.840
MARISHA: Caduceus is the only one good at being good.

2248
01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.740
So that's his thing that he is good at.

2249
01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.030
LAURA: He's really good at it.

2250
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.863
MARISHA: Yeah.

2251
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:44.050
LAURA: Yeah.

2252
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:44.883
MARISHA: I don't know if I agree

2253
01:31:44.883 --> 01:31:46.963
with his views on authority.

2254
01:31:46.963 --> 01:31:48.029
(laughter)

2255
01:31:48.029 --> 01:31:49.340
LAURA: Really?

2256
01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.215
MARISHA: I know.

2257
01:31:51.215 --> 01:31:52.540
I know.

2258
01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.470
LAURA: Thanks, Beau.

2259
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:56.510
MARISHA: Hey, I--

2260
01:31:56.510 --> 01:32:00.060
I know you're taking this Yasha thing hard

2261
01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.622
and the truth is, I am, too.

2262
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.690
I just, you know.

2263
01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:11.250
LAURA: Are better at hiding it.

2264
01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:14.060
MARISHA: I'm sure it'll come out in a terrible way

2265
01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.702
here later on.

2266
01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.170
Trust issues.

2267
01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:20.790
Abandonment.

2268
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:22.380
Yeah, you know, it's you know,

2269
01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:25.825
it all taps into so many of my issues.

2270
01:32:25.825 --> 01:32:26.908
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

2271
01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:34.720
MARISHA: Anyway, it's not a sandstorm yet.

2272
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.553
LAURA: The wind is--

2273
01:32:35.553 --> 01:32:38.505
MARISHA: The wind is--
LAURA: Windy.

2274
01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:41.840
(whistling)

2275
01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.640
MARISHA: I had this, this...

2276
01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:49.192
last night, when the storm was kicking up.

2277
01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.560
It was like I was only half sleeping

2278
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.190
because I kept waiting for lightning.

2279
01:32:56.490 --> 01:33:01.356
Like, something would--

2280
01:33:02.973 --> 01:33:05.040
I don't know.

2281
01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.714
LAURA: Like save her?

2282
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:09.403
MARISHA: Yeah.

2283
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:13.046
Yeah.

2284
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.970
LAURA: What if we can, like,

2285
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:19.320
find a way to talk to the Stormlord or something

2286
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.770
and he can break through?

2287
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:25.422
He's more powerful than anything else, right?

2288
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:30.833
MARISHA: Remember that fight she had with that thing?

2289
01:33:30.833 --> 01:33:33.240
LAURA: Lightning thingie on the boat?
MARISHA: Lightning thing on the boat?

2290
01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.531
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

2291
01:33:37.041 --> 01:33:40.060
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe you're right, but...

2292
01:33:41.150 --> 01:33:43.407
Maybe there's something to that.

2293
01:33:45.092 --> 01:33:45.925
LAURA: Yeah.

2294
01:33:45.925 --> 01:33:49.430
I'll talk to the Traveler.

2295
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:51.755
See if he's got any advice.

2296
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:56.290
MARISHA: When were you supposed to connect with him again?

2297
01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:59.420
That's a thing that's happening, right?

2298
01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.730
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2299
01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:02.100
Yeah, yeah.

2300
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:04.040
MARISHA: Days blur together.

2301
01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.280
LAURA: It's coming up.

2302
01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.213
I need to talk to him.

2303
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:12.120
MARISHA: Have you not talked to him in a while?

2304
01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.210
LAURA: I mean, no no no, I've talked to him some, you know,

2305
01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:19.210
just not as maybe I have in the past.

2306
01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.840
Should go talk to him.

2307
01:34:25.257 --> 01:34:26.905
Yeah.

2308
01:34:26.905 --> 01:34:28.397
MARISHA: (sighs)

2309
01:34:28.397 --> 01:34:30.530
LAURA: I'm going to wander away.

2310
01:34:31.484 --> 01:34:33.560
MATT: All right, so while this is transpiring,

2311
01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.910
Caleb, anything you're wanting to handle or just...

2312
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:38.920
LIAM: I was just eavesdropping on all that.

2313
01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.000
MATT: Okay, got it.

2314
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.643
LIAM: I didn't go anywhere, I was just standing there.

2315
01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:43.585
MATT: Makes sense.

2316
01:34:43.585 --> 01:34:44.418
Checks out.
TALIESIN: There was a clown

2317
01:34:44.418 --> 01:34:45.251
in Whitestone by the way,

2318
01:34:45.251 --> 01:34:47.019
by the name of Sarah McShinyshorts.

2319
01:34:47.019 --> 01:34:49.200
So you were not far off.

2320
01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:50.360
Well, that is a thing.

2321
01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.193
That's canon.

2322
01:34:51.193 --> 01:34:52.790
LIAM: In fact, in fact,

2323
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:56.490
after a pause after Jester walked away,

2324
01:34:59.175 --> 01:35:01.918
I'll just toss out to Beauregard.

2325
01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.250
MARISHA: Uh, I forgot you were standing there.

2326
01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:06.083
Sorry.

2327
01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:08.930
LIAM: Yeah, that happens.

2328
01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.310
Caduceus is not the only one who's good.

2329
01:35:20.410 --> 01:35:22.220
MARISHA: You talking about me?

2330
01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.710
LIAM: You shit on yourself a lot, yeah, I am.

2331
01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:27.120
You shit on yourself a lot

2332
01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.941
and I see you do good day after day, so

2333
01:35:30.941 --> 01:35:33.251
there's a little bit of dissonance there.

2334
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.123
MARISHA: Old opinions die hard, I guess.

2335
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:41.150
LIAM: I am slightly--

2336
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:43.300
MARISHA: Is that what they say, that's what they say, right?

2337
01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:44.691
Whatever.

2338
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.050
LIAM: Slightly nervous about the nuke.

2339
01:35:50.050 --> 01:35:51.940
Slightly.

2340
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.297
We had a lot of different hopes and dreams.

2341
01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:04.700
And we are swimming a fast-moving current right now.

2342
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:07.020
I think there's strength in this group,

2343
01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.407
I really want this group to hold.

2344
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.617
I think you and Fjord, actually,

2345
01:36:15.490 --> 01:36:18.422
are very good at holding the group together.

2346
01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.803
MARISHA: You know,

2347
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:31.565
when my father wanted me to take over the business,

2348
01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.400
he was a piece of shit,

2349
01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.550
but something that he said

2350
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:42.267
has been sticking out in my head here lately.

2351
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:47.218
I don't know if he ever followed his own advice, but

2352
01:36:48.556 --> 01:36:49.700
he said try and hire people

2353
01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.070
who don't agree with you all the time.

2354
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:56.398
Surround yourself with people with different opinions.

2355
01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.150
I think,

2356
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:03.760
I think I would be concerned

2357
01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:06.364
if everyone agreed with Fjord and I,

2358
01:37:06.364 --> 01:37:07.970
and I would be very concerned

2359
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:10.570
if everyone agreed with Caduceus.

2360
01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.083
LIAM: Well, I argue with you all the time.

2361
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.340
MARISHA: At least that means we're strong

2362
01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.630
in our own thoughts and opinions.

2363
01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:21.465
Not easily swayed.

2364
01:37:23.730 --> 01:37:27.021
LIAM: I worry that

2365
01:37:27.021 --> 01:37:29.387
Yasha splintering off

2366
01:37:29.387 --> 01:37:31.930
will fracture the whole and

2367
01:37:34.393 --> 01:37:36.268
I think we need to

2368
01:37:38.223 --> 01:37:41.780
try to find a way to meet everyone's needs.

2369
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:45.235
We need to visit this kiln.

2370
01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:50.938
We have to get Nott's family to safety somehow.

2371
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:54.440
Make sure that Jester's mother is safe.

2372
01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.431
Make sure that Fjord

2373
01:37:58.431 --> 01:38:00.622
is okay, I guess.

2374
01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:10.170
Then we have all this stuff happening very fast

2375
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:12.000
and then we're going to have a lot of mud

2376
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.702
thrown in our face tomorrow, probably.

2377
01:38:15.702 --> 01:38:17.827
What am I getting at?

2378
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:22.520
Keep being good at good.

2379
01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.113
Keep being good at being good.

2380
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:31.740
You help people, you know,

2381
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:34.457
whether you realize it or not.

2382
01:38:36.879 --> 01:38:39.140
That's it.

2383
01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.740
MARISHA: Thanks, Caleb.

2384
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:45.020
You're not too bad yourself.

2385
01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:46.887
Like, most of the time.

2386
01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:51.730
It's like 10 percent that you're, you know.

2387
01:38:51.730 --> 01:38:53.220
It's debatable.

2388
01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:58.220
LIAM: Is the 10 percent is when I am doing well or poorly?

2389
01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:00.943
MARISHA: Don't read too much into it.

2390
01:39:00.943 --> 01:39:03.193
(laughter)

2391
01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:07.240
MATT: All right.

2392
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.185
LIAM: Let's just stop talking.

2393
01:39:08.185 --> 01:39:09.890
MATT: All right, perfect.

2394
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:11.730
While that's transpiring, Fjord.

2395
01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:12.680
What are you doing?

2396
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:16.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll find my way over, I guess,

2397
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.800
then to a dark shadow or corner or alley

2398
01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.810
or behind a building and--

2399
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:26.180
in all the time that we've been in the Dynasty,

2400
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.550
different plumage and decorations of the soldiers.

2401
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:30.400
MATT: Correct.

2402
01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.010
TRAVIS: Is there any way to differentiate between

2403
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.937
what might constitute an officer?

2404
01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:40.220
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: And what might constitute a sergeant?

2405
01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:41.770
More of an enlisted man.

2406
01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:42.603
Someone that works for--

2407
01:39:42.603 --> 01:39:45.120
TALIESIN: A floral crown.

2408
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.020
MATT: No, officers tend to have

2409
01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.803
a cape over one shoulder.

2410
01:39:50.803 --> 01:39:52.070
Not necessarily over the shoulder,

2411
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:53.360
but one part of the shoulder armor itself

2412
01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.270
will carry a capelet

2413
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:58.360
that bends behind,

2414
01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:02.920
generally in purples and blues with gold trim.

2415
01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.580
You're not sure what the positioning is,

2416
01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:07.160
you don't have enough knowledge about the Dynasty to know

2417
01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.260
what different color and designs differentiate

2418
01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.150
between the different positions

2419
01:40:11.150 --> 01:40:13.170
but you have seen those that speak with authority

2420
01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:16.780
and usually are the heads of various groups of soldiers,

2421
01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:19.260
both in the field and in Bazzoxan and in Rosohna

2422
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:22.690
seem to have this capelet.

2423
01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:23.523
TRAVIS: Okay.

2424
01:40:23.523 --> 01:40:25.798
MATT: Over one arm and shoulder.

2425
01:40:25.798 --> 01:40:28.250
TRAVIS: Have I also seen

2426
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:32.770
maybe couriers or message carriers of this service,

2427
01:40:32.770 --> 01:40:33.800
not somebody that would be wearing

2428
01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.730
the same standard full plate or armor

2429
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:37.600
that's someone of infantry position,

2430
01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.480
but maybe someone that's a little more lightly armored

2431
01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.103
to carry a message or...

2432
01:40:42.103 --> 01:40:46.430
MATT: I would say, make a,

2433
01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.066
make a perception check.

2434
01:40:49.066 --> 01:40:51.000
TRAVIS: Okay.

2435
01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:52.933
16.

2436
01:40:52.933 --> 01:40:54.170
MATT: 16.

2437
01:40:54.170 --> 01:40:56.020
I'll say, because you've been keeping watch

2438
01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.190
for a good part of the day,

2439
01:40:57.190 --> 01:40:58.860
and looking out here,

2440
01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:02.500
you have seen what essentially are informational runners

2441
01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.840
that will, especially in this time,

2442
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.910
where everyone's starting to gear up

2443
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:09.910
for the Bright Queen's seeming warning,

2444
01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:12.330
you've seen some lighter-armored individuals

2445
01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:16.610
that will be rushing from segment to segment to, you know,

2446
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:19.360
troop to troop around the city to deliver.

2447
01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.570
You can see similar designs, but nothing like

2448
01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:23.880
the full heavy pauldrons, full chest armor.

2449
01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.431
It's mainly leathers with similar coloration

2450
01:41:26.431 --> 01:41:28.960
and what looks to be like a,

2451
01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.767
like a circlet head frame as opposed to an actual helmet.

2452
01:41:32.767 --> 01:41:36.970
TRAVIS: I will use Mask of Many Faces to disguise myself

2453
01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:41.460
as more of a courier-type bugbear individual.

2454
01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.240
MATT: Okay, big old furry bugbear.

2455
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:46.920
TRAVIS: I will locate the barracks.

2456
01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.320
Is there anyone outside the entrance

2457
01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.070
to the barracks standing guard?

2458
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:53.680
MATT: There are a handful of barracks here.

2459
01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.550
In keeping watch around there,

2460
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:58.580
there's a few that are pretty well-guarded.

2461
01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.080
It looks like some buildings here

2462
01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.290
have been retrofitted into barracks

2463
01:42:01.290 --> 01:42:03.560
and there's one that's currently still being expanded

2464
01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.710
and constructed as more soldiers are sent northward,

2465
01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:10.000
just over time, to Bazzoxan.

2466
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.880
You do find, like every now and then,

2467
01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:13.830
every 15 or so minutes,

2468
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:14.710
there might be a period of time

2469
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:16.420
where nobody's directly at the front.

2470
01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:17.253
TRAVIS: Okay.

2471
01:42:18.735 --> 01:42:21.960
I will try and locate someone standing guard at the barracks

2472
01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.240
not wearing the plumage of an officer.

2473
01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.120
MATT: Okay. I'll say within an hour, you find somebody.

2474
01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:30.023
TRAVIS: I'll walk up and I will say:

2475
01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:34.490
Can I have your ear for a moment, please?

2476
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:35.710
MATT: Okay, as you approach,

2477
01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:40.680
the one that you see here is an armored ogre

2478
01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.150
who currently has this large great club

2479
01:42:44.150 --> 01:42:46.100
that's affixed through a leather strap on the side.

2480
01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:47.890
It's hanging and digging this groove in the ground

2481
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:48.723
where he's been walking

2482
01:42:48.723 --> 01:42:52.090
but it's currently just resting there at the side.

2483
01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:55.900
Big, giant, quadruple chin

2484
01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:58.310
that seems to remove any semblance of a neck,

2485
01:42:58.310 --> 01:43:00.960
the head just resting between two shoulders.

2486
01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.400
Large belly, armored,

2487
01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:05.240
and glances over as you approach and he goes,

2488
01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.050
"Yeah?"

2489
01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:11.230
TRAVIS: I am sorry, I have been traveling all day.

2490
01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:15.540
Is there someone in these barracks that speaks for the men?

2491
01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:19.468
No, not an officer, someone that looks out for

2492
01:43:19.468 --> 01:43:23.700
the new and inexperienced.

2493
01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.824
MATT: "Yeah, it could be me."

2494
01:43:25.824 --> 01:43:27.260
(laughter)

2495
01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:28.650
SAM: Yes!

2496
01:43:28.650 --> 01:43:30.980
TRAVIS: Great.

2497
01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.910
I come with a message from the Bright Queen, sorry.

2498
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:36.210
MATT: "Bright Queen?"

2499
01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:37.100
TRAVIS: Yes.

2500
01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:39.416
MATT: "(chuckles) All right!"

2501
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:45.305
TRAVIS: I work for her at the Den Bilan, the security detail

2502
01:43:45.305 --> 01:43:49.573
and I bring an urgent message of a danger out here.

2503
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:55.560
I delivered it to the gate, but as it was being read,

2504
01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.560
it sounded, it sounded most dangerous indeed.

2505
01:44:00.914 --> 01:44:03.493
MATT: "All right."

2506
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:07.046
TRAVIS: I worry that its words

2507
01:44:07.046 --> 01:44:10.754
might not find the right ears.

2508
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:13.165
MATT: "Kay."

2509
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:18.723
TRAVIS: There is a great danger that is coming this way.

2510
01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.500
A creature.

2511
01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.170
It carries a blade on its arm

2512
01:44:25.170 --> 01:44:29.050
and if engaged, will...

2513
01:44:29.050 --> 01:44:31.430
Are you getting all of this?

2514
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:34.330
MATT: "It's got a blade in its arm

2515
01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:39.275
"and it's coming this way."

2516
01:44:39.275 --> 01:44:40.717
(laughter)
"Right?"

2517
01:44:40.717 --> 01:44:42.463
TRAVIS: Yes.

2518
01:44:42.463 --> 01:44:43.569
For Bazzoxan.

2519
01:44:43.569 --> 01:44:44.602
MATT: "Got it.

2520
01:44:44.602 --> 01:44:47.833
"Got it, lickity-split."

2521
01:44:47.833 --> 01:44:50.350
(laughter)

2522
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:53.790
TRAVIS: If you could, spread word to the men

2523
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:57.830
that further damage to this creature makes it more powerful,

2524
01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:02.810
amplifies its ability to drive men mad, make them flee.

2525
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:05.140
MATT: "Spreadin' the word.

2526
01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.495
"Makin' all the men mad.

2527
01:45:07.495 --> 01:45:09.050
"Got it."

2528
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:13.450
TRAVIS: Thank you, I feel much better knowing

2529
01:45:13.450 --> 01:45:18.080
this message has reached sound and responsible ears.

2530
01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:21.425
MATT: "Don't worry, little fuzzball, I got it."

2531
01:45:21.425 --> 01:45:24.345
(laughter)

2532
01:45:24.345 --> 01:45:25.295
TALIESIN: We cool, we cool.

2533
01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.740
TRAVIS: I will go get a drink.

2534
01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:32.400
I bid you good day.

2535
01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.526
MATT: "Good day!"
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2536
01:45:34.526 --> 01:45:36.560
(laughter)

2537
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.440
Stay in the light, and I start walking off.

2538
01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:40.660
As you walk off, he turns around and goes

2539
01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:43.655
and you start to hear him lumbering into the barracks.

2540
01:45:43.655 --> 01:45:48.655
"Hey! Bright Queen says there's a mad guy

2541
01:45:49.021 --> 01:45:50.810
"coming!

2542
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:52.598
"Danger!

2543
01:45:53.534 --> 01:45:55.853
"Holdin' a blade!

2544
01:45:55.853 --> 01:45:58.796
(laughter)

2545
01:45:58.796 --> 01:46:01.945
"It's going to make you mad!

2546
01:46:01.945 --> 01:46:04.075
"(chuckling)

2547
01:46:04.075 --> 01:46:07.855
"He was a tired little one."

2548
01:46:07.855 --> 01:46:09.080
That's the last thing you hear

2549
01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.710
as he continues walking inside.

2550
01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:11.839
TRAVIS: Shit.

2551
01:46:11.839 --> 01:46:12.950
(laughter)

2552
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:16.041
Fuck.
SAM: Message received.

2553
01:46:16.930 --> 01:46:17.763
TALIESIN: Well done.

2554
01:46:17.763 --> 01:46:22.210
TRAVIS: I'll keep moving towards the gate.

2555
01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:23.925
MATT: You can hear other people interrogating

2556
01:46:23.925 --> 01:46:26.717
about what the fuck he's talking about.

2557
01:46:26.717 --> 01:46:28.210
TRAVIS: Shit.

2558
01:46:28.210 --> 01:46:30.150
As I head towards the gate where we were before,

2559
01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.260
and where we rebuffed,

2560
01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:36.072
anyone in that area with the plumage of an officer?

2561
01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:38.650
MATT: Near the gate, yes.

2562
01:46:39.566 --> 01:46:41.624
TALIESIN: (yawns) Excuse me.

2563
01:46:42.477 --> 01:46:47.105
TRAVIS: (audibly inhales and exhales)

2564
01:46:47.105 --> 01:46:47.960
No.

2565
01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.010
I think better of it.

2566
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:50.980
I go to the Ready Room.

2567
01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:52.008
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2568
01:46:52.008 --> 01:46:55.080
(laughter)

2569
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:55.913
MATT: All right.

2570
01:46:55.913 --> 01:46:56.830
You guys have regathered,

2571
01:46:56.830 --> 01:47:00.310
we'll say a day spent keeping watch,

2572
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:01.800
going about your business,

2573
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.800
and preparing for the next leg of your journey,

2574
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.146
wherever that may be.

2575
01:47:06.146 --> 01:47:07.800
Is there anything else you wish to discuss or go over

2576
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.040
before a night's rest comes to you?

2577
01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.090
SAM: Night's rest.

2578
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.970
LAURA: Whoa.

2579
01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:12.803
Whoa.

2580
01:47:12.803 --> 01:47:14.980
MATT: I'm asking, is there anything else you during the day?

2581
01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:15.840
LAURA: I guess not.

2582
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:16.796
TRAVIS: Is there any fol--

2583
01:47:16.796 --> 01:47:18.510
I mean, I know where we are.

2584
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:21.476
Is there any sign of foliage of any kind around here?

2585
01:47:21.476 --> 01:47:23.637
Or is it all just wasteland?

2586
01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:25.320
MATT: On this end, you can see bits of

2587
01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:28.150
dried scrub brush.

2588
01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:32.220
It's not quite as bad as the Barbed Fields were directly,

2589
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.450
you can see especially along the base

2590
01:47:33.450 --> 01:47:34.450
where the mountains are,

2591
01:47:34.450 --> 01:47:37.540
there are areas of some very hardy,

2592
01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:42.540
desert plant life that seem to exist

2593
01:47:42.547 --> 01:47:44.880
and subsist around the vicinity.

2594
01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.013
TALIESIN: Singing bush.

2595
01:47:46.013 --> 01:47:49.550
MATT: Yep. (imitates Singing Bush from Three Amigos)

2596
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:53.380
SAM: Jester, do you have any more sending ability today?

2597
01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:55.100
LAURA: I've got one more I can do.

2598
01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:58.200
SAM: Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to check in on

2599
01:47:59.590 --> 01:48:04.590
either my hubby or perhaps Shakäste.

2600
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:06.460
LAURA: Which one do you want?

2601
01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:08.797
SAM: Oh boy, that's a tough choice.

2602
01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:13.468
What's that?

2603
01:48:13.468 --> 01:48:14.540
TRAVIS: I'm getting ready to send.

2604
01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:15.373
SAM: Oh.

2605
01:48:16.981 --> 01:48:19.920
Thought you were going to punch me in the face.

2606
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:22.548
TALIESIN: Message sent and received.

2607
01:48:22.548 --> 01:48:25.070
SAM: I don't think hubby's in danger yet.

2608
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.903
Maybe.

2609
01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:28.960
LAURA: It's up to you.

2610
01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.960
LIAM: Nott the Brave, when we go back,

2611
01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.390
it's hard to predict what's about to happen,

2612
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:36.240
we could be thrown in prison, I don't think so,

2613
01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:40.767
we could be sent off somewhere else or pulled into intrigue.

2614
01:48:40.767 --> 01:48:43.440
Do you know in advance what you want to do

2615
01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.973
with your husband when we get there?

2616
01:48:45.973 --> 01:48:47.706
Tell him to stay put, send him on?

2617
01:48:47.706 --> 01:48:49.500
SAM: I wanted him to be safe, but I don't know anyone

2618
01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:53.945
who can take care of him in Rosohna.

2619
01:48:53.945 --> 01:48:58.470
Maybe I was thinking Beauregard's friend?

2620
01:48:58.470 --> 01:49:02.110
But she's never met him, has she?

2621
01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:03.780
Was she there with us?

2622
01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.443
LAURA: She isn't, we haven't seen her there yet,

2623
01:49:06.443 --> 01:49:08.090
but I know she was on her way.

2624
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:10.720
MARISHA: We met her in the cellar.

2625
01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.150
MATT: You met her in Asarius.

2626
01:49:12.150 --> 01:49:13.380
MARISHA: In Asarius.

2627
01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.880
MATT: And you set up plans to meet in Rosohna

2628
01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.090
and have not done so.

2629
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:18.210
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

2630
01:49:18.210 --> 01:49:21.595
SAM: We don't have anyone in Rosohna that we can trust.

2631
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:26.190
I don't know, I think, he can't just run...

2632
01:49:26.190 --> 01:49:31.050
MARISHA: I could, I should probably reach out to her.

2633
01:49:32.734 --> 01:49:34.080
TALIESIN: You're <i>that</i> friend.

2634
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:34.913
MARISHA: Huh?

2635
01:49:34.913 --> 01:49:36.150
TALIESIN: You're that friend.

2636
01:49:36.150 --> 01:49:38.878
LAURA: Who am I sending a message to, you guys?

2637
01:49:38.878 --> 01:49:40.344
SAM: Send a message to Shakäste.

2638
01:49:40.344 --> 01:49:42.710
Just ask if he's gotten to my son yet.

2639
01:49:42.710 --> 01:49:44.730
LAURA: Okay, your son's name is Luc?

2640
01:49:44.730 --> 01:49:46.300
SAM and LAURA: Luc.

2641
01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:47.133
Okay.
TALIESIN: Luck.

2642
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:49.870
LAURA: Sending a message.

2643
01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:54.660
Shakäste.

2644
01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:55.760
Okay, I'm not saying.
SAM: Sorry.

2645
01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:56.593
LAURA: I'm thinking it in my head.

2646
01:49:56.593 --> 01:49:59.330
TALIESIN: You're thinking in your head.

2647
01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.113
LAURA: Hey.

2648
01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.150
It's Jester, have you got to Luc yet?

2649
01:50:08.150 --> 01:50:09.120
Woof!

2650
01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.175
Things are crazy.

2651
01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.718
Let me know where you guys are.

2652
01:50:18.718 --> 01:50:22.650
Nott's really wondering.

2653
01:50:22.650 --> 01:50:24.352
Thank you.

2654
01:50:26.467 --> 01:50:29.180
SAM: Nice. Good.

2655
01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:31.360
MATT: "Hey, Jester, baby."

2656
01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.354
(laughter)

2657
01:50:33.354 --> 01:50:35.080
TRAVIS: Shakäste!

2658
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:36.230
MARISHA: Every time!

2659
01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:37.220
MATT: "Don't you worry.

2660
01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:40.010
"I went ahead and just finished dropping

2661
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:44.120
"that boy and that old lady off down in Nicodranas,

2662
01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:45.659
"and making my way back north."

2663
01:50:45.659 --> 01:50:47.270
LAURA and SAM: (gasping)

2664
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:48.961
MATT: "I got you."

2665
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.140
SAM: Wow!
LAURA: Shakäste's amazing!

2666
01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:54.720
SAM and LAURA: Yeah!

2667
01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.290
LAURA: I am assuming that I told you everything.

2668
01:50:56.290 --> 01:50:58.740
SAM: You just told me everything.
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

2669
01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:00.657
SAM: You were so excited you blurted it out!

2670
01:51:00.657 --> 01:51:02.113
LAURA: Saying it right along with him!

2671
01:51:02.113 --> 01:51:02.972
SAM: Wow!

2672
01:51:02.972 --> 01:51:03.859
LAURA: Yeah.

2673
01:51:03.859 --> 01:51:04.910
SAM: That was amazing.

2674
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:06.460
LAURA: I mean, that was so much faster

2675
01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:07.320
than I thought he was going to be.

2676
01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.570
SAM: Any other details did he give you

2677
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:10.383
or did it sound like it's done?
LAURA: No, he just said they're safe.

2678
01:51:10.383 --> 01:51:11.710
He called my baby.

2679
01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:14.600
SAM: Oh, do you think--?

2680
01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:16.141
LAURA: No.
SAM: No?

2681
01:51:16.141 --> 01:51:17.730
LAURA: I think he just calls everybody baby.

2682
01:51:17.730 --> 01:51:20.034
No, I mean, I don't think I'm his type.

2683
01:51:20.034 --> 01:51:20.990
SAM: Oh.

2684
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:24.720
LAURA: I don't know, maybe I am, I don't know.

2685
01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.570
SAM: What do you think his type is?

2686
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:28.600
What would be Shakäste's type?

2687
01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.110
LAURA: Someone really cool.

2688
01:51:30.110 --> 01:51:31.740
SAM: Well, you're cool!

2689
01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:36.740
LAURA: Yeah, I mean but someone chill and cool.

2690
01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:38.246
SAM: You're not chill?

2691
01:51:38.246 --> 01:51:39.079
LAURA: No!

2692
01:51:39.079 --> 01:51:41.228
(laughter)

2693
01:51:41.228 --> 01:51:43.537
TRAVIS: That's true. Very true.

2694
01:51:43.537 --> 01:51:46.120
SAM: You know who was chill was Yasha...

2695
01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:48.070
Yasha was kind of chill.

2696
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:51.010
LAURA: Yasha was really chill.
SAM: Before she tried to kill us all.

2697
01:51:51.010 --> 01:51:53.170
LAURA: She didn't try to kill all of us.

2698
01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:54.470
Just, you know, Fjord.

2699
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:55.303
SAM: And me.

2700
01:51:55.303 --> 01:51:56.450
LAURA: And you.

2701
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:58.150
SAM: She would've killed you, too.

2702
01:51:58.150 --> 01:51:59.130
LAURA: Probably.

2703
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:00.590
TALIESIN: She was chill,

2704
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:02.830
but not cool.

2705
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:04.790
LIAM: Nott, I don't know, again,

2706
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:07.260
if we will have the ability or the time

2707
01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:11.040
when we go back on Rosohna, but we could,

2708
01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:16.040
I've already voiced my reservations about your family,

2709
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:19.890
and everything Nicodranas, but we could

2710
01:52:19.890 --> 01:52:21.990
bring your husband to your child.

2711
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:23.910
SAM: Well, now that my child's in Nicodranas,

2712
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:26.370
that's exactly what I would like to do, yes.

2713
01:52:26.370 --> 01:52:30.250
LIAM: Yes, we can visit, use his tower.

2714
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:32.180
If we are granted the time.

2715
01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:33.013
SAM: Yes!

2716
01:52:33.013 --> 01:52:34.970
Yes, that would be incredible.

2717
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:35.803
LAURA: That would be great.

2718
01:52:35.803 --> 01:52:40.002
SAM: If we are lucky enough to be free that long.

2719
01:52:40.002 --> 01:52:43.180
LAURA: We'll find out in the morning!
SAM: We'll find out tomorrow!

2720
01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:45.420
LAURA: Everybody sleep well!

2721
01:52:47.473 --> 01:52:49.170
MATT: All right, so you guys are,

2722
01:52:49.170 --> 01:52:51.550
you finished out the day, all right.

2723
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:53.570
LIAM: Yes.

2724
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:55.090
MATT: As you are resting--

2725
01:52:55.090 --> 01:52:57.650
TALIESIN: Damn it.
TRAVIS: Damn, shitballs and...

2726
01:52:57.650 --> 01:53:00.625
TALIESIN: Are we taking shifts or are we not taking shifts?

2727
01:53:00.625 --> 01:53:01.545
TRAVIS: We didn't say we were.

2728
01:53:01.545 --> 01:53:03.260
MARISHA: No.

2729
01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:04.600
Oh shit!

2730
01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:06.350
What is happening?
SAM: (slide whistle)

2731
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:08.500
LAURA: I feel like I should talk to the Traveler before.

2732
01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:11.205
SAM: Guys, I bought a slide whistle at the Ready Room!

2733
01:53:11.205 --> 01:53:13.091
MATT: You want to talk to the Traveler?

2734
01:53:13.091 --> 01:53:15.741
LAURA: I feel like I should talk to him before we go to bed,

2735
01:53:15.741 --> 01:53:17.290
or as everybody else is going to sleep,

2736
01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:18.270
I want to stay up.

2737
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:19.910
TALIESIN: I was going to suggest to somebody

2738
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:21.670
that we do the shift thing as well

2739
01:53:21.670 --> 01:53:24.410
but that somebody's awake.

2740
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:25.780
MATT: We'll say Jester takes first watch

2741
01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:30.160
while she's having her communion.

2742
01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:34.727
LAURA: I'll start by, you know, drawing in my journal.

2743
01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:42.540
I'll draw just Yasha's eyes.

2744
01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:45.750
I'll try to get them how they used to be

2745
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:50.723
and then how they looked in the scry, the difference.

2746
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:56.555
I'll just say: I'm sorry.

2747
01:53:58.625 --> 01:54:00.686
I'm sorry I haven't talked to you as much.

2748
01:54:00.686 --> 01:54:04.248
I...I don't...

2749
01:54:05.110 --> 01:54:07.743
I don't know what's going on.

2750
01:54:09.046 --> 01:54:11.417
I feel kind of lost.

2751
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.293
Are you there?

2752
01:54:20.770 --> 01:54:22.920
MATT: In a warm, humid interior,

2753
01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:26.960
your friends sleeping nearby,

2754
01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.840
drifts to a colder sensation,

2755
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.720
and out of the periphery of your eyes you see the cloak

2756
01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:36.090
whip.

2757
01:54:36.090 --> 01:54:38.610
As you're sitting there,

2758
01:54:38.610 --> 01:54:41.120
you sense the presence of the Traveler

2759
01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.633
sit there next to you, the hood leaning

2760
01:54:43.633 --> 01:54:46.558
into the other side of your periphery.

2761
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:51.842
"It's all right, you've been busy.

2762
01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:54.958
"As have I."

2763
01:54:54.958 --> 01:54:58.420
LAURA: You have?

2764
01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:03.420
MATT: "But a measly couple months from now,

2765
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:06.580
"you'll get to meet the rest of your family."

2766
01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:09.270
LAURA: Yeah, couple months, huh?

2767
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:12.863
Do you, do you, do you have a location yet?

2768
01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:17.170
MATT: "That's actually why I wanted to talk to you."

2769
01:55:17.170 --> 01:55:22.157
He draws back into a sitting position.

2770
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:26.882
"Considering where to hold the grand gathering.

2771
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:31.350
"I was thinking maybe the island of Rumblecusp,

2772
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:32.970
"off the Menagerie Coast.

2773
01:55:32.970 --> 01:55:35.560
"Do you have any suggestions?"

2774
01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:38.370
LAURA: Rumblecusp, have I heard of that place before?

2775
01:55:38.370 --> 01:55:41.560
MATT: You've heard it, but you've never been there.

2776
01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:43.780
LAURA: What's special about Rumblecusp?

2777
01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:46.263

"But I've never been."

2780
01:55:49.753 --> 01:55:54.143
LAURA: Well, if it's pretty and tropical, you know.

2781
01:55:54.143 --> 01:55:56.265
That would be nice.

2782
01:55:57.745 --> 01:55:59.800
I mean, anywhere close to Nicodranas

2783
01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:02.760
you know is going to be very pretty.

2784

MATT: "Have you any other suggestions yourself?"

2785
01:56:06.850 --> 01:56:09.420
LAURA: Oh, well...

2786
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:17.870
Probably not anywhere in the Empire

2787
01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:22.000
or probably not anywhere in Xhorhas.

2788
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.260

2791
01:56:30.328 --> 01:56:33.090
well, I guess if it's a couple months away,

2792
01:56:33.090 --> 01:56:34.250
I was going to say

2793
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:38.050
I hear that the north is pretty cool right now,

2794
01:56:38.050 --> 01:56:40.180
there's like a volcano or something

2795
01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:45.178
that is supposed to be pretty popular, but...

2796
01:56:46.890 --> 01:56:48.711
MATT: Are you really pushing for a volcano suggestion?

2797
01:56:48.711 --> 01:56:51.110
(laughter)

2798
01:56:51.110 --> 01:56:52.950
LAURA: That would be kind of crazy, right?

2799
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:56.070
To have a bunch of people gathered in a volcano?

2800
01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:57.169
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2801
01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:59.150

2810
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:28.160
that's way prettier, I understand, you know.

2811
01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.150

2824

2825
01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:24.030
and some of it is really pretty.

2826
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:28.030
You know, like we saw a cavern that was full of crystals.

2827
01:58:28.030 --> 01:58:29.450
You would actually really like that,

2828
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:32.630
maybe we should have the convention there, I'm not sure.

MATT: "You tell me."

2830
01:58:37.262 --> 01:58:39.270
LAURA: But a lot of it is just really sad

2831
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:42.665
and a lot of people getting hurt and...

2980
02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:47.540
BRIAN: Rachel Kleine wants to know:

2981
02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:49.170
Do you think Fjord will be more harsh

2982
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:51.800
with his feelings about Yasha because he not only wasted

2983
02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:54.740
a precious spell slot to try and help her escape,

2984
02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:59.740
but also because he was the closest to dying at her hand?

2985
02:05:59.770 --> 02:06:01.420
TRAVIS: Yes!

2986
02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:02.926
Yes!

2987
02:06:02.926 --> 02:06:05.925
Unequivocally yes!

2988
02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:09.090
Oh yes, Rachel Kleine!

2989
02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:11.455
You understand me!

2990
02:06:11.455 --> 02:06:13.500
I understand you!

2991
02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:16.116
We are one!

2992
02:06:16.116 --> 02:06:18.260
(laughter)

2993
02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:19.430
Yes!

2994
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:21.930
I only got two of those bitches!

2995
02:06:21.930 --> 02:06:23.730
It was the last one!

2996
02:06:23.730 --> 02:06:27.361
I zoomed in, she said, "Nope!" Fwoomp,

2997
02:06:27.361 --> 02:06:30.050
and then almost killed me!

2998
02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:31.340
DANI: Oh boy.

2999
02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:33.210
TRAVIS: Yes, he will be harsh.

3000
02:06:33.210 --> 02:06:34.900
BRIAN: What are you drinking, dude?

3001
02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:37.143
TRAVIS: I don't know.

3002
02:06:37.143 --> 02:06:39.762
It burns my lips, though.

3003
02:06:39.762 --> 02:06:41.920
BRIAN: I don't want another episode like this for a while.

3004
02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:43.130
I want smut.

3005
02:06:43.130 --> 02:06:45.090
Was the Angel of Irons cult backstory

3006
02:06:45.090 --> 02:06:47.890
a collaboration with Ashley or did she just say,

3007
02:06:47.890 --> 02:06:50.100
"there's a period of time that she has no memory of"

3008
02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:51.590
and left it for you to come up with?

3009
02:06:51.590 --> 02:06:52.860
MATT: It's the latter.

3010
02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:56.750
She said there was a period of time that she doesn't recall

3011
02:06:56.750 --> 02:07:01.720
in her life and as a gift to any dungeon master,

3012
02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.460
for that, so she's been discovering aspects of her story

3013
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:07.478
along with the rest of you.

3014
02:07:12.535 --> 02:07:15.140
(laughter)

3015
02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:17.690
DANI: Well well well, Travis Willingham.

3016
02:07:17.690 --> 02:07:19.250
TRAVIS: What?

3017
02:07:19.250 --> 02:07:21.600
I'm sitting here listening to the answer respectfully.

3018
02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.700
DANI: Uh-huh.

3019
02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:26.760
MATT: So yeah, that's a likely story.

3020
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:31.404
BRIAN: A likely story indeed.

3021
02:07:31.404 --> 02:07:32.724
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

3022
02:07:32.724 --> 02:07:35.810
BRIAN: Was the Laughing Hand, aka Gigglefist, which was a--

3023
02:07:35.810 --> 02:07:36.643
MATT: Gigglefist?

3024
02:07:36.643 --> 02:07:38.624
BRIAN: Travis' previous PSN name.

3025
02:07:38.624 --> 02:07:40.691
(laughter)

3026
02:07:40.691 --> 02:07:41.910
TRAVIS and MATT: Gigglefist.

3027
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:43.704
BRIAN: He had to change it when it got leaked.

3028
02:07:43.704 --> 02:07:46.552
TRAVIS: (terrifying giggling)

3029
02:07:46.552 --> 02:07:47.760
MATT: I know what you're dressing up as for Halloween.

3030
02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:49.630
BRIAN: Wait, give me the closeup on Trav a sec.

3031
02:07:49.630 --> 02:07:51.070
TRAVIS: Oh no, no.

3032
02:07:51.070 --> 02:07:53.200
BRIAN: Then take the question away for a sec.

3033
02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:55.170
Then give me that Gigglefist impression one more time

3034
02:07:55.170 --> 02:07:57.576
to that camera, please, to Greg. You know which Greg.

3035
02:07:57.576 --> 02:07:59.656
TRAVIS: (terrifying giggling)

3036
02:07:59.656 --> 02:08:01.580
BRIAN: There you go, Arsequeef.

3037
02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:03.250
You know, you're just feeding him now.

3038
02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:04.620
He gets up at four in the morning.

3039
02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:05.453
We have to--

3040
02:08:05.453 --> 02:08:07.290
DANI: Can he make a GIF that requires sound?

3041
02:08:07.290 --> 02:08:08.547
BRIAN: But he does a public service.

3042
02:08:08.547 --> 02:08:10.090
MATT: He'll find a way to do it.

3043
02:08:10.090 --> 02:08:11.890
TRAVIS: Add your own sound, make it better.

3044
02:08:11.890 --> 02:08:14.150
BRIAN: Considering the Wildmother
has offered him protection,

3045
02:08:14.150 --> 02:08:16.490
how does Fjord feel about traveling to the anvil

3046
02:08:16.490 --> 02:08:19.120
for answers regarding L.H.?

3047
02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:20.060
TRAVIS: Stoked about it.

3048
02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:20.893
BRIAN: Kay.

3049
02:08:20.893 --> 02:08:21.840
TRAVIS: Super stoked about it.

3050
02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:24.090
I don't know what the fuck the anvil is.

3051
02:08:24.090 --> 02:08:26.350
I don't know anything about Caduceus.

3052
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:27.960
I want to learn more.

3053
02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:31.880
I am-- will be lobbying heavily next game

3054
02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.690
to go there with the quickness.

3055
02:08:33.690 --> 02:08:34.523
BRIAN: Yeah.

3056
02:08:34.523 --> 02:08:36.830
TRAVIS: Maybe not drop a little note with the Bright Queen.

3057
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:37.990
Get the fuck out.

3058
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.823
Do it later.

3059
02:08:38.823 --> 02:08:40.040
No no no, we'll leave a message.

3060
02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:41.310
We'll be fine.

3061
02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:43.080
We'll leave a post-it somewhere.

3062
02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.470
MATT: Whatever you guys want to do.

3063
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:46.303
It's your story.

3064
02:08:46.303 --> 02:08:47.373
TRAVIS: Yeah, but what is the anvil?

3065
02:08:47.373 --> 02:08:48.206
Where is it?

3066
02:08:48.206 --> 02:08:49.270
How far away is it?

3067
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:50.500
What does it have?

3068
02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.120
More Wildmother, please?

3069
02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:53.410
Yes, all those things!

3070
02:08:53.410 --> 02:08:55.085
BRIAN: "More Wildmother please?"

3071
02:08:55.085 --> 02:08:56.876
TRAVIS: Yeah!
BRIAN: I want more Wildmother.

3072
02:08:56.876 --> 02:08:57.876
TRAVIS: Anything that's not Uk'otoa,

3073
02:08:57.876 --> 02:09:00.334
thank you very much.
BRIAN: More Caduceus backstory, too.

3074
02:09:00.334 --> 02:09:02.625
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: You can still go back and talk to Uk'otoa.

3075
02:09:02.625 --> 02:09:04.480
You still just got one more orb.

3076
02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:06.080
TRAVIS: I don't want to.

3077
02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:07.260
I...no.

3078
02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:10.810
Uk'otoa took my shit for like a whole half a day.

3079
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:12.330
BRIAN: Ooh, could Uk'otoa Took My Shit

3080
02:09:12.330 --> 02:09:13.750
be our next bumper sticker?

3081
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:16.530
Like The Traveler Is My Co-Pilot,

3082
02:09:16.530 --> 02:09:18.320
Uk'otoa Took My Shit?

3083
02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:20.055
That's pretty great.

3084
02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:25.043
MATT: (groans)

3085
02:09:25.926 --> 02:09:27.125
(laughter)

3086
02:09:27.125 --> 02:09:28.000
Well, would you look at that.

3087
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.752
I think it worked.

3088
02:09:29.752 --> 02:09:31.760
You were right, Pumat Number Three.

3089
02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:35.790
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

3090
02:09:35.790 --> 02:09:37.943
Pumat, Pumat Number Three?

3091
02:09:40.037 --> 02:09:41.236
Oh boy.

3092
02:09:41.236 --> 02:09:42.550
Well, hello there!

3093
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:44.070
I am Pumat Prime.

3094
02:09:44.070 --> 02:09:47.800
It's good to finally join you here in the Prime Dimension.

3095
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.040
Ah, I see this is the Twitch Prime Realm, I think?

3096
02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:54.221
And, oh.

3097
02:09:54.221 --> 02:09:56.350
We're in the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

3098
02:09:56.350 --> 02:10:00.270
Well, would you look at that, you got chat and everything.

3099
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:03.940
Respectfully, I was looking for the Prime Rib Realm

3100
02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:06.640
but this isn't too bad.

3101
02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:08.860
You see, if you already have access

3102
02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:11.930
to the Amazon Prime Realm, you can get a free subscription

3103
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:14.800
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime Realm.

3104
02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:17.590
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship

3105
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:18.790
after that peace treaty

3106
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:21.710
the prime ministers signed a few years back.

3107
02:10:21.710 --> 02:10:23.760
You just have to remember to renew

3108
02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:26.630
your Twitch Prime subscription at the top of each month.

3109
02:10:26.630 --> 02:10:27.520
Respectfully.

3110
02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:28.850
And hey.

3111
02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:30.617
If you're already a subscriber,

3112
02:10:30.617 --> 02:10:33.030
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

3113
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:35.830
using the Gift a Sub button.

3114
02:10:35.830 --> 02:10:39.040
That is assuming the Empire hasn't sent a tax man to

3115
02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:42.920
your shop here recently. (nervous laughter)

3116
02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:44.440
All right, well, off to find that

3117
02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:46.600
darn elusive Prime Rib Realm.

3118
02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:50.360
Who know the Prime Dimension had so many pockets?

3119
02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.978
Good luck!

3120
02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:54.880
Pumat Three?

3125
02:24:18.504 --> 02:24:19.820
MATT: And welcome back.

3126
02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:23.222
So...
(laughter)

3127
02:24:23.222 --> 02:24:25.550
We have our winner of the Pride dice vault.

3128
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:28.604
The winner is Drewcifer333.

3129
02:24:28.604 --> 02:24:29.437
(cheering)

3130
02:24:29.437 --> 02:24:30.650
Congratulations, Drewcifer,

3131
02:24:30.650 --> 02:24:34.243
we'll go ahead and get your vault ASAP.

3132
02:24:34.243 --> 02:24:36.302
TALIESIN: The beast has been dieting.

3133
02:24:36.302 --> 02:24:37.135
MARISHA: Half of a--

3134
02:24:37.135 --> 02:24:39.460
TRAVIS: Downsizing.
TALIESIN: 333.

3135
02:24:40.310 --> 02:24:44.880
MATT: So. Coming to consciousness the following morning,

3136
02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:46.330
you all are rested.

3137
02:24:46.330 --> 02:24:49.670
A familiar warm sense has taken the chamber,

3138
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:53.020
though not as hot as the day before.
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

3139
02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:55.854
MATT: It's a bit musty in the scent department, sure.

3140
02:24:55.854 --> 02:24:57.287
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

3141
02:24:57.287 --> 02:24:59.810
MATT: Fjord's been finding the broccoli.

3142
02:24:59.810 --> 02:25:02.348
TRAVIS: The food out here doesn't agree with me.

3143
02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:05.750
MATT: You would have a sensitive stomach.

3144
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:07.347
SAM: Oh, we're already fighting.

3145
02:25:07.347 --> 02:25:10.097
TRAVIS: It was a really bad fart.

3146
02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:15.580
MATT: So. What would you like to do, guys?

3147
02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:17.850
SAM: Well, it's time to bamf home.

3148
02:25:17.850 --> 02:25:19.190
TRAVIS: We should check, make sure nothing happened

3149
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:20.520
overnight outside of this room.

3150
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:22.150
SAM: Sure, sure sure.

3151
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:24.041
TRAVIS: Head outside to see if there's any

3152
02:25:24.041 --> 02:25:24.874
obvious commotion.

3153
02:25:24.874 --> 02:25:26.490
LAURA: Can we open the windows on the roof?

3154
02:25:26.490 --> 02:25:28.680
MATT: Sure, go for it.
LAURA: Before we head down and look out.

3155
02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:30.280
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

3156
02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:32.323
No, you're fine.

3157
02:25:32.323 --> 02:25:34.670
As you look out there,

3158
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:37.420
you look out and the streets look

3159
02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:39.310
the same as they were when you went to sleep.

3160
02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:41.050
Different troops, of course,

3161
02:25:41.050 --> 02:25:43.030
set on their various watches,

3162
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:45.107
but you can see there's still a heavy perimeter

3163
02:25:45.107 --> 02:25:48.437
that is patrolling the exterior of Bazzoxan.

3164
02:25:48.437 --> 02:25:51.890
You can't quite see the Umbra Gate from this window,

3165
02:25:51.890 --> 02:25:54.670
but there doesn't appear to be any sort of

3166
02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:57.920
issues or raised intensity, no bodies lying in the streets.

3167
02:25:57.920 --> 02:25:59.403
LAURA: Okay.

3168
02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:03.900
SAM: All right, Caleb, how does this work?

3169
02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:08.900
LIAM: Well I have some gems, enough to--

3170
02:26:09.008 --> 02:26:11.633
and jade, so enough to--

3171
02:26:11.633 --> 02:26:14.370
set this off. I cannot do this constantly

3172
02:26:14.370 --> 02:26:16.728
unless I have a steady supply,

3173
02:26:16.728 --> 02:26:19.670
but I can do it today.

3174
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:22.867
I just need a minute to start drawing on the floor.

3175
02:26:22.867 --> 02:26:24.900
LAURA: What kind of gemstones do you need?

3176
02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:27.260
SAM: He's got some.

3177
02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:32.250
LIAM: 50 gold worth, I have jade, one piece of jade left.

3178
02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:37.067
Or anything anyone wants to contribute.

3179
02:26:37.067 --> 02:26:40.234
I think jade is worth 100 gold.

3180
02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:44.156
LAURA: Let me see what I have.

3181
02:26:44.156 --> 02:26:45.980
MARISHA: Did we pick up some shit?

3182
02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:50.860
SAM: I have some jade also, but, you know.

3183
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:53.780
I've a pearl necklace.

3184
02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:56.717
LAURA: I have a pocket full of crystals.

3185
02:26:56.717 --> 02:26:58.300
(laughter)

3186
02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:01.230
LIAM: I place my one piece of jade on the ground

3187
02:27:01.230 --> 02:27:04.330
and start tracing a circle

3188
02:27:04.330 --> 02:27:09.020
and thinking of the teleportation circle in Rosohna.

3189
02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:10.534
MATT: Okay.

3190
02:27:10.534 --> 02:27:11.684
LIAM: And begin to cast.

3191
02:27:11.684 --> 02:27:13.117
MATT: All right, so...

3192
02:27:15.580 --> 02:27:18.820
As you guys watch Caleb setting the gemstone,

3193
02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:20.960
the jade piece in the center,

3194
02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:22.980
the way he draws all these lines and sigils.

3195
02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:25.070
It's a large, circular equation on the ground,

3196
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:28.821
made of various arcane symbols intersecting, overlapping,

3197
02:27:28.821 --> 02:27:31.510
and as he begins to progressively fill in,

3198
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:32.850
it seems to spiral inward

3199
02:27:32.850 --> 02:27:34.950
as he fills out the rest of this equation.

3200
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:40.051
You watch the surrounding exterior of it begin to glow

3201
02:27:40.051 --> 02:27:42.830
as an echo afterward.

3202
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:44.340
As he gets towards the very, very center,

3203
02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:46.280
he finishes a central circle,

3204
02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:49.550
draws in a particular emblem,

3205
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:51.390
and then places the jade onto it.

3206
02:27:51.390 --> 02:27:53.140
As it does, the jade shatters.

3207
02:27:54.192 --> 02:27:56.450
The entire circle (whooshing)

3208
02:27:56.450 --> 02:27:58.070
flares up brightly beneath.

3209
02:27:59.030 --> 02:28:02.247
As you know, you only have but a moment, Caleb.

3210
02:28:05.923 --> 02:28:07.400
LIAM: Is it six seconds to get everybody through

3211
02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:09.720
or am I thinking back to Campaign One trees?

3212
02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:11.640
MATT: I believe it is a very short time

3213
02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:14.350
to get everybody onto the circle.

3214
02:28:14.350 --> 02:28:16.970
Let me double check.

3215
02:28:16.970 --> 02:28:18.024
Just to be safe.

3216
02:28:18.024 --> 02:28:18.903
TRAVIS: Bullet time. (time slowing down)

3217
02:28:18.903 --> 02:28:20.543
MARISHA: On the elevator.
MATT: Kind of, yes.

3218
02:28:20.543 --> 02:28:21.451
TRAVIS: (Time speeding up)

3219
02:28:22.303 --> 02:28:23.660
MATT: It does last for one round, so yes.

3220
02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:25.040
LAURA: Oh, six seconds.
MATT: You got to go.

3221
02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:26.400
MARISHA: Go go go!

3222
02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:29.242
LIAM: Caleb starts pulling and shoving people.

3223
02:28:29.242 --> 02:28:30.676
MATT: (Whooshing)

3224
02:28:30.676 --> 02:28:31.692
TRAVIS: Hey, watch where you're fucking--

3225
02:28:31.692 --> 02:28:33.780
MATT: One after another, you all get pushed into the circle

3226
02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:35.460
and you feel your breath (exhales)

3227
02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:37.310
pulled out from your lungs for just a second.

3228
02:28:37.310 --> 02:28:40.560
There's a brief streak of light and dark and suddenly,

3229
02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:43.180
you're standing in a familiar

3230
02:28:44.370 --> 02:28:48.150
subterranean, graphite-looking chamber.

3231
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:50.740
Looking around, you recall when you first arrived

3232
02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:53.610
from your journey from Asarius.

3233
02:28:53.610 --> 02:28:56.760
You now stand within

3234
02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:59.540
the Underarches of the Lucid Bastion.

3235
02:28:59.540 --> 02:29:03.240
You can see two of the guards who stand there, armored,

3236
02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:06.660
Kryn soldiers, look over in your direction,

3237
02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:09.930
and briefly take a step in your way

3238
02:29:09.930 --> 02:29:12.710
a bit aggressively, but then recognize as you approach.

3239
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:13.723
TRAVIS: Multi pass.

3240
02:29:13.723 --> 02:29:15.973
(laughter)

3241
02:29:17.725 --> 02:29:18.830
MATT: But yes, you have arrived

3242
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:21.140
and now in Rosohna in an instant,

3243
02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:26.140
traversing the majority of Xhorhas with a single step.

3244
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:27.640
LAURA: It's really cool, Caleb.

3245
02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:30.060
It was really, really cool.

3246
02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:32.844
LIAM: Do you think the moorbounders will be okay?

3247
02:29:32.844 --> 02:29:34.450
SAM: They'll be fine.

3248
02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.315
Maybe?

3249
02:29:37.315 --> 02:29:39.235
(laughter)

3250
02:29:39.235 --> 02:29:41.377
TRAVIS: Come on, let's stay on task.

3251
02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:47.800
SAM: Is anyone waiting for us?

3252
02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:50.200
LIAM: Yeah, anyone here in this chamber?

3253
02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:51.190
MATT: In the chamber, no.

3254
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:52.580
Not immediately.

3255
02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:56.050
There was no notification as to how you were arriving,

3256
02:29:56.050 --> 02:29:58.760
so there isn't a party awaiting you

3257
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.350
here in the Underarches.

3258
02:30:00.350 --> 02:30:02.080
SAM: Do we know where to go?

3259
02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:04.448
MATT: Not at the moment.

3260
02:30:04.448 --> 02:30:06.920
I mean, you know the path you took previously

3261
02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:08.180
so you could just try and retrace your steps.

3262
02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:09.150
LAURA: There are guards there.

3263
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:10.816
MATT: Yes, there are.

3264
02:30:10.816 --> 02:30:12.335
TRAVIS: Announce ourselves.

3265
02:30:12.335 --> 02:30:13.168
MATT: Okay.

3266
02:30:13.168 --> 02:30:15.040
Within a short time, you guys are brought to

3267
02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:17.410
the familiar antechamber before

3268
02:30:17.410 --> 02:30:20.183
the Bright Queen's throne chamber.

3269
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:23.840
There was expectation to your arrival

3270
02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:27.620
so you don't have to wait more than 15 or so minutes

3271
02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:29.840
before the doors open.

3272
02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:31.840
If you want to take a moment to gather your thoughts

3273
02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:33.710
before you enter, you're welcome to.

3274
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:35.630
SAM: Who's doing the talking?

3275
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:37.160
I vote it should be me and Jester

3276
02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:40.500
but I could be overruled.

3277
02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:42.590
TALIESIN: I'll happily speak if...

3278
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:47.156
SAM: You're so truthful.

3279
02:30:47.156 --> 02:30:48.481
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Are you sure we should--

3280
02:30:48.481 --> 02:30:49.780
LAURA: Fjord.

3281
02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:51.602
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: I think Fjord, too.

3282
02:30:51.602 --> 02:30:53.913
SAM: What about Fjord and Caduceus?

3283
02:30:53.913 --> 02:30:55.650
LAURA: No, because they're going to say
very different things

3284
02:30:55.650 --> 02:30:57.200
and then it's going to get us in trouble.

3285
02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:58.320
TRAVIS: Yeah, look.

3286
02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:01.260
I appreciate y'all coming back in after me, right?

3287
02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:03.320
I'm here because of you guys.

3288
02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:04.600
I'm just going to lie to her.

3289
02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:05.970
I'm telling you right now.

3290
02:31:05.970 --> 02:31:07.000
Honestly.

3291
02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.280
So if you think that being honest with her

3292
02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:11.113
is what we're doing,

3293
02:31:11.113 --> 02:31:13.970
trying to establish some trust from within,

3294
02:31:13.970 --> 02:31:18.970
transparency, then either Caleb or Caduceus should talk.

3295
02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:20.003
TALIESIN: Caleb?

3296
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:24.200
LIAM: Well, let's do it together and Fjord,

3297
02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:28.353
anyone, if you think you can help, feel free to step in.

3298
02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:32.607
MARISHA: Just remember, we don't need to make it personal.

3299
02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:37.260
LAURA: Just don't say it's our fault, okay?

3300
02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:39.060
SAM: Also, start with a compliment.

3301
02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:41.620
Ladies like it when you notice their hair

3302
02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:45.739
or their shoes, so lead with that.

3303
02:31:45.739 --> 02:31:47.860
LAURA: I'll compliment, and then you guys can take over.

3304
02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:49.390
SAM: That's a great idea.

3305
02:31:49.390 --> 02:31:50.410
LAURA: Okay.

3306
02:31:50.410 --> 02:31:52.040
SAM: Ladies like it when a fellow--

3307
02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:53.360
LAURA: Exactly.
SAM: Compliments them.

3308
02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:54.490
LAURA: I'm pretty fashionable.

3309
02:31:54.490 --> 02:31:56.170
SAM: I know, but you know, he's like a tall,

3310
02:31:56.170 --> 02:31:59.190
dark, and handsome guy over there, compliment from him.

3311
02:31:59.190 --> 02:32:00.515
TRAVIS: I wouldn't say dark.

3312
02:32:00.515 --> 02:32:02.015
It's more light and pastel.

3313
02:32:02.015 --> 02:32:05.700
TALIESIN: Extremely pale, even by my family standards.

3314
02:32:07.490 --> 02:32:10.570
TRAVIS: It's literally teal and pink.

3315
02:32:10.570 --> 02:32:12.510
TALIESIN: Practically translucent.

3316
02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:15.740
SAM: Yeah, all right. Forget it, then.

3317
02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:19.120
LAURA: It's like built-in highlighter, it's really nice.

3318
02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:21.662
TALIESIN: I've always liked to think so.

3319
02:32:21.662 --> 02:32:23.150
MATT: Are you guys comfortable with your plan?

3320
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.983
SAM: We're ready!

3321
02:32:23.983 --> 02:32:24.816
MATT: All righty.

3322
02:32:24.816 --> 02:32:27.693
MARISHA: Ready as we'll ever be.

3323
02:32:27.693 --> 02:32:31.184
LIAM: Also, I'm going to cast

3324
02:32:31.184 --> 02:32:34.317
dunamancy onto Caduceus.

3325
02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:39.540
TALIESIN: What is this dunamancy going to do?

3326
02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:41.130
LIAM: It's just going to make sure

3327
02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:43.600
that you're especially convincing,

3328
02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:45.080
and I cast Fortune's Favor

3329
02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:47.642
with a white pearl to my forehead.

3330
02:32:47.642 --> 02:32:50.362
Then you see geometric shapes for a split second.

3331
02:32:50.362 --> 02:32:51.920
TALIESIN: Wow.

3332
02:32:52.802 --> 02:32:55.860
MATT: So you now have a fragment of possibility with it.

3333
02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:57.150
You can reroll a d20 if you wish.

3334
02:32:57.150 --> 02:32:58.960
TALIESIN: All right.

3335
02:32:58.960 --> 02:32:59.793
MATT: Once.

3336
02:33:02.130 --> 02:33:02.963
All righty.

3337
02:33:04.390 --> 02:33:06.476
15, 20 or so minutes pass.

3338
02:33:06.476 --> 02:33:10.134
(heavy doors opening)

3339
02:33:10.134 --> 02:33:12.060
The doors of the antechamber open,

3340
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:16.010
into the familiar, overhead-lit

3341
02:33:16.010 --> 02:33:18.460
throne room of the Bright Queen.

3342
02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:20.400
Already, you can hear voices bustling.

3343
02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:22.820
It's a little more active than last time you were here,

3344
02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:27.300
where it was somewhat half as intense.

3345
02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:28.730
You can see all the seats are filled,

3346
02:33:28.730 --> 02:33:31.710
both on the two opposing house sides

3347
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:35.430
as well as the central chairs

3348
02:33:35.430 --> 02:33:38.000
that flank the Bright Queen's throne.

3349
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.810
As you are stepping out, you can see

3350
02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:43.185
a troop of four individuals,

3351
02:33:43.185 --> 02:33:46.185
three drow and one hobgoblin

3352
02:33:46.185 --> 02:33:50.375
are carrying a table out past you.

3353
02:33:50.375 --> 02:33:52.720
At a quick glance, looking down,

3354
02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:54.180
there's a sheet thrown over it a little bit,

3355
02:33:54.180 --> 02:33:56.200
but part of it's visible

3356
02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:58.848
and you can see it looks to be a map.

3357
02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:01.840
It's a long table.

3358
02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:02.673
MARISHA: A map of?

3359
02:34:02.673 --> 02:34:04.070
TRAVIS: Are there any pieces on it, like a war table?

3360
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.903
MARISHA: Yeah, a war map?

3361
02:34:04.903 --> 02:34:06.310
MATT: Make a perception check.

3362
02:34:06.310 --> 02:34:07.143
TRAVIS: Can I do that, too?

3363
02:34:07.143 --> 02:34:08.693
MATT: Yes, you may.

3364
02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:11.530
MARISHA: 19.
TRAVIS: 18.

3365
02:34:11.530 --> 02:34:13.014
Okay.

3366
02:34:13.014 --> 02:34:13.847
TALIESIN: Table.

3367
02:34:15.107 --> 02:34:16.448
MATT: There you go.

3368
02:34:16.448 --> 02:34:18.300
Getting a glance at it, you make out

3369
02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:22.325
that it seems to be a map of

3370
02:34:22.325 --> 02:34:24.990
probably Xhorhas.

3371
02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:26.930
The way it's laid out, and the section that you do see

3372
02:34:26.930 --> 02:34:29.909
appears to be the beginning of the Penumbra Range

3373
02:34:29.909 --> 02:34:32.490
to the east which means the length of the table

3374
02:34:32.490 --> 02:34:37.020
will probably lead it quite deeply into the Empire

3375
02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:39.485
and Western Wynandir.

3376
02:34:39.485 --> 02:34:42.043
So that's ushered past.

3377
02:34:42.043 --> 02:34:44.400
There's conversation and whispering

3378
02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:45.600
and discussion in the distance,

3379
02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:46.640
echoing throughout the chamber,

3380
02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:50.840
this central, single white orb is still hung, affixed above

3381
02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:53.680
the center, the chains dangling to the far corners

3382
02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:57.730
of this dull, gray,

3383
02:34:57.730 --> 02:35:00.770
quartz-like material

3384
02:35:00.770 --> 02:35:02.930
the interior is constructed from.

3385
02:35:02.930 --> 02:35:05.180
As you step forward, the voices hush,

3386
02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:09.910
the soldiers flank the steps in which you ascend

3387
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:11.240
and as you begin to approach,

3388
02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:14.710
the Bright Queen stands from her throne,

3389
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:18.670
her violet eyes shining from the light above.

3390
02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:23.520
Her headpiece, the three horns curling behind,

3391
02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:25.620
holding her staff.

3392
02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:29.220
She looks down upon you as you begin to make your way

3393
02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:33.898
towards the center of raised section of the chamber.

3394
02:35:35.050 --> 02:35:37.083
She puts her hand out.

3395
02:35:38.170 --> 02:35:40.700
"Welcome, Mighty Nein.

3396
02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:45.970
"We must first give our thanks

3397
02:35:45.970 --> 02:35:49.435
"in your aid in warning the Dynasty

3398
02:35:49.435 --> 02:35:52.580
"of the Imperial assault.

3399
02:35:52.580 --> 02:35:57.410
"Many lives were saved thanks to your deed.

3400
02:35:57.410 --> 02:36:01.575
"And the garrison remains in our control.

3401
02:36:01.575 --> 02:36:03.680
"As you had also noted,

3402
02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:06.490
"a series of strategic assassination attempts

3403
02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:11.485
"did also occur shortly after the assault.

3404
02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:17.030
"Now here in Rosohna, we were ready for this.

3405
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:19.900
"Aside from some wounded, no lives were lost.

3406
02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:22.475
"We captured one of the assailants.

3407
02:36:22.475 --> 02:36:27.282
"You've all proven very worthy

3408
02:36:27.282 --> 02:36:30.110
"of the reward that you were given.

3409
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:32.150
"So thank you."

3410
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:33.550
SAM: You're welcome.

3411
02:36:34.970 --> 02:36:37.210
LAURA: Your eyes look very ravishing today.

3412
02:36:37.210 --> 02:36:38.690
SAM: I was going to say the same thing.

3413
02:36:38.690 --> 02:36:39.523
LAURA: Yeah.

3414
02:36:39.523 --> 02:36:40.940
They seem exceptionally bright.

3415
02:36:40.940 --> 02:36:43.720
SAM: Twinkle. Wouldn't you agree, Caduceus?

3416
02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:45.627
TALIESIN: I-- sure?

3417
02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:52.948
Your highness, we have a...

3418
02:36:52.948 --> 02:36:55.700
We bring some unfortunate news.

3419
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:58.056
LAURA: I already told her.

3420
02:36:58.056 --> 02:36:59.780
On the spell.

3421
02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:01.130
TALIESIN: More specifically though,

3422
02:37:01.130 --> 02:37:04.188
and to go into more detail, I suppose,

3423
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:10.207
we were woefully unprepared for what we found up north.

3424
02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:17.380
We stumbled into a creature,

3425
02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:22.990
an infernal creature summoning one of the

3426
02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:27.373
agents of the Crawling King.

3427
02:37:27.373 --> 02:37:31.990
MATT: At this point, Skysybil, the elderly female goblin

3428
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:35.200
who sits adjacent to the Bright Queen,

3429
02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:40.200
leans forward at the edge of her seat.

3430
02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:44.120
"So it has been said that the Laughing Hand

3431
02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:47.093
"is what you refer to."

3432
02:37:47.093 --> 02:37:48.720
TALIESIN: It is loose.

3433
02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:52.025
MATT: "Such an entity was supposedly destroyed

3434
02:37:52.025 --> 02:37:56.930
"in the Calamity, or the years that followed."

3435
02:37:56.930 --> 02:38:00.710
TALIESIN: It was contained, not destroyed.

3436
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:02.610
MATT: "Well, if what you say is true,

3437
02:38:02.610 --> 02:38:07.610
"this is indeed an additional thorn in the Dynasty's side."

3438
02:38:07.810 --> 02:38:11.420
TALIESIN: This thing may be more than a thorn.

3439
02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:16.420
This is the beginning, I believe, of something...

3440
02:38:16.686 --> 02:38:18.661
dreadful,

3441
02:38:18.661 --> 02:38:22.702
terrible that threatens everybody.

3442
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:28.660
Resources are necessary to combat this,

3443
02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:32.098
it tore through us, we did not all make it back.

3444
02:38:33.577 --> 02:38:38.540
MATT: The Bright Queen nods, acknowledging this.

3445
02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:43.372
"'Tis a very unfortunate circumstance how you describe it.

3446
02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:48.173
"But you've done what you could.

3447
02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:52.290
"We shall take it from here.

3448
02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:57.390
"Den Duendalos has numerous historical specialists

3449
02:38:57.390 --> 02:39:01.800
"and researchers, who since you gave us this message,

3450
02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:06.638
"are looking into all facets of this creature's nature

3451
02:39:08.370 --> 02:39:10.390
"and to suss out a means in which

3452
02:39:10.390 --> 02:39:14.018
"it can be found and destroyed."

3453
02:39:14.018 --> 02:39:18.267
LAURA: It was a follower of the Angel of Irons.

3454
02:39:19.768 --> 02:39:23.320
MATT: Looks over towards Mirimm and Mirimm goes,

3455
02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:26.078
"I am unfamiliar with that one."

3456
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:29.820
"Well then, perhaps this should also be placed

3457
02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:31.770
"upon their research plate."

3458
02:39:31.770 --> 02:39:34.353
TALIESIN: He said he was gathering others.

3459
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:36.810
MATT: "Well, we have sent word

3460
02:39:36.810 --> 02:39:40.193
"and reinforced the guard to Bazzoxan.

3461
02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:45.410
"But, we have many things

3462
02:39:45.410 --> 02:39:50.090
"we are also achieving at this moment."

3463
02:39:50.090 --> 02:39:52.090
TALIESIN: We may have a special request,

3464
02:39:52.090 --> 02:39:55.870
if that would please you.

3465
02:39:55.870 --> 02:40:00.290
We would like to be kept in the information loop

3466
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:04.870
on this creature, as it has done personal damage to us

3467
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:07.200
and we believe that we have an

3468
02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.150
avenue of

3469
02:40:11.150 --> 02:40:14.190
possible victory.

3470
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:16.740
I feel that there might be an answer to how

3471
02:40:16.740 --> 02:40:18.980
to defeat this creature in the north.

3472
02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:23.170
I was hoping for a little faith

3473
02:40:23.170 --> 02:40:24.640
and perhaps a little support

3474
02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:28.006
in a

3475
02:40:28.006 --> 02:40:31.690
expeditious journey up north to see if a weapon

3476
02:40:31.690 --> 02:40:33.880
that can defeat this creature can be found.

3477
02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:35.180
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3478
02:40:37.224 --> 02:40:39.535
SAM: This is going great.

3479
02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:42.255
TALIESIN: 20.

3480
02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:47.990
MATT: "I will admit, there is trepidation

3481
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:50.360
"from members of this court,

3482
02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.168
"due to the circumstances

"of your less than,

"how would I put it,

"less than successful journey northward.

"However, if you feel

"that you can do this without us

"to this direction you are traveling,

"you may go with our blessing."

3491
02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:29.150
TALIESIN: Just safe travel.

3492
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:32.604
Perhaps we may need...

3493
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:38.404
some form of expeditious travel on top of everything else,

3494
02:41:38.404 --> 02:41:42.343
but not a lot is necessary.

3495
02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:45.293
MATT: "Perhaps."

3496
02:41:45.293 --> 02:41:50.070
TALIESIN: And the permission to,

3497
02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:55.220
we probably have to cross a northern border at some point

3498
02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:59.768
and we may have to put a few affairs in order.

3499
02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:03.150
MATT: "Very well, take your time and rest.

3500
02:42:03.150 --> 02:42:04.520
"I can see on all of your faces

3501
02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:06.340
"you've been through quite a bit."

3502
02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:09.900
TRAVIS: Would you care to see this Laughing Hand?

3503
02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:15.260
MATT: "If you have a means of presenting its visage,

3504
02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:16.093
"then yes, please."

3505
02:42:16.093 --> 02:42:19.030
TRAVIS: I'll turn my hands and I'll cast Major Image

3506
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:22.230
and I will recreate to scale the Laughing Hand

3507
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:23.740
with the sounds that it was creating

3508
02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:26.580
right there in front of the entire fucking throne room.

3509
02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:27.680
SAM: I'm going to go in front of it

3510
02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:29.546
and just sort of cower in fear.

3511
02:42:29.546 --> 02:42:31.754
(screaming)

3512
02:42:31.754 --> 02:42:35.780
MATT: Its looming form appears, the cloak gently swaying.

3513
02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:38.550
The open gashes across its body,

3514
02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:42.980
the teeth emerging from them chuckling silently.

3515
02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:45.160
The room immediately begins to fill with whispers

3516
02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:49.930
as you see the various other drow and orc and bugbear

3517
02:42:49.930 --> 02:42:51.920
members of this court leaning into each other

3518
02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:54.810
and looking curious and worried.

3519
02:42:54.810 --> 02:42:56.930
TALIESIN: The more we hurt it, the louder it got.

3520
02:42:56.930 --> 02:42:59.960
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to go over and slice it with my dagger.

3521
02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:01.860
TRAVIS: It just goes right through it.

3522
02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:03.120
SAM: But can't you change it?

3523
02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:04.478
TRAVIS: Nope.
SAM: Yes, you can!

3524
02:43:04.478 --> 02:43:06.130
It's Major Image; you can control it!

3525
02:43:06.130 --> 02:43:07.296
TRAVIS: Can I?
SAM: Yes!

3526
02:43:07.296 --> 02:43:09.546
(laughter)

3527
02:43:11.090 --> 02:43:13.010
TRAVIS: Aw yeah, I'll create an extra mouths!

3528
02:43:13.010 --> 02:43:15.590
MATT: As Nott is quietly shouting under her breath

3529
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:17.690
toward Fjord in the middle of this entire chamber.

3530
02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:20.551
SAM: Don't make me look like an asshole!

3531
02:43:20.551 --> 02:43:21.651
TRAVIS: What are you doing, Nott?

3532
02:43:21.651 --> 02:43:25.330
MARISHA: It's a tech rehearsal, it's just, hang on.

3533
02:43:25.330 --> 02:43:26.830
SAM: There's a lighting cue here!

3534
02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:30.480
TRAVIS: In the effort of sharing information,

3535
02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:34.570
perhaps it'll help your Den Duendalos

3536
02:43:34.570 --> 02:43:36.467
on their history check.

3537
02:43:36.467 --> 02:43:39.070
SAM: Good accent.

3538
02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:43.140
MARISHA: We really wish that the severity of this

3539
02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:44.460
does not go understated.

3540
02:43:45.850 --> 02:43:47.110
MATT: "Oh, it is not understated.

3541
02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:49.780
"Believe you me,

3542
02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:54.780
"we know very well about infernal or ancient threats.

02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:06.930
"We do have many things to worry about, however,

02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:11.550
"so we cannot divert more than we have

3547
02:44:11.550 --> 02:44:15.010
"currently holding the garrison for now."

3548
02:44:16.212 --> 02:44:17.045
TALIESIN: Of course.

3549
02:44:17.045 --> 02:44:18.040
MATT: "We have plans.

3550
02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:22.403
"Things are turning in our favor in this struggle.

3551
02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:24.880
"So thank you."

3552
02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:27.138
SAM: You said that you had some successes

3553
02:44:27.138 --> 02:44:29.040
while we were away?

3554
02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:29.873
MATT: "Yes."

3555
02:44:29.873 --> 02:44:31.650
LAURA: You captured an assailant?

3556
02:44:31.650 --> 02:44:34.120
MATT: "We did, we have a Scourger here currently

3557
02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:36.660
"for interrogation and execution.

3558

"retrieving what they've taken."

3564
02:44:59.970 --> 02:45:04.612
SAM: The scourger that you found was on the front lines?

3565
02:45:05.849 --> 02:45:07.310
MATT: "There were a handful of assassins

3566
02:45:07.310 --> 02:45:09.760
"that had come through Rosohna, as you had warned.

3567

"There were those who were wounded,

"but no lives were lost, on our side at least."

3570
02:45:16.890 --> 02:45:20.790
SAM: Who-- what kind of,

3571
02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:24.220
I've never seen a Scourger, what did this person?

3572
02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:26.350
Was it a monster or a person?

3573
02:45:27.479 --> 02:45:29.595
MATT: "It was a woman, human."

3574
02:45:29.595 --> 02:45:31.970
MARISHA: (whispering) They're what Caleb was training to be.

3575
02:45:31.970 --> 02:45:34.635
SAM: Sure. A human woman?

3576
02:45:34.635 --> 02:45:35.720
SAM: What is your interest in this?"

3577
02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:37.350
SAM: I'm just, I'm curious, I've never,

3578
02:45:37.350 --> 02:45:40.220
Scourger sounds so scary, that's all.

3579
02:45:40.220 --> 02:45:41.550
TRAVIS: They're more like a myth to us.

3580
02:45:41.550 --> 02:45:43.270
We've never encountered one.

3581
02:45:43.270 --> 02:45:44.620
MATT: "Right."

3582
02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:47.960
LAURA: You said you're closer to

3583
02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:51.750
getting back what the Empire stole.

3584
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:56.750
Did they steal more of the dodecahedrons?

3585
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:59.040
MATT: "They still have one beacon."

3586
02:45:59.040 --> 02:45:59.873
LAURA: Beacons.

3587
02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:04.140
MATT: "That cannot be allowed.

3588
02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:09.020
"Until that is returned, we'll do whatever it takes."

3589
02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:09.853
LAURA: Do you know where--

3590
02:46:09.853 --> 02:46:13.177
LIAM: I hope that our eagerness to aid

3591
02:46:13.177 --> 02:46:15.720
and our frankness will have earned further trust

3592
02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:20.668
on top of what we already offered up to you.

3593
02:46:24.030 --> 02:46:27.770
We would continue to aid and

3594
02:46:27.770 --> 02:46:32.610
more knowledge, more understanding would help.

3595
02:46:32.610 --> 02:46:34.310
MATT: "Of course.

3596
02:46:34.310 --> 02:46:37.120
"We will share what we can as it comes."

3597
02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:38.920
LAURA: He wants to get into your library.

3598
02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:44.205
LIAM: I was actually going to request further training with

3599
02:46:45.228 --> 02:46:46.830
your friend from House Thelyss

3600
02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:51.830
and also, perhaps there is some knowledge of this Scourger.

3601
02:46:52.490 --> 02:46:57.490
I have already intimated a little of my past and

3602
02:47:02.180 --> 02:47:05.521
would be curious to

3603
02:47:05.521 --> 02:47:08.146
know if dealings are the same.

3604
02:47:08.146 --> 02:47:11.422
And if this is a person

3605
02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:17.680
I've had any dealings with.

3606
02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:19.472
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3607
02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:27.750
LIAM: 16.

3608
02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:28.583
MATT: 16.

3609
02:47:33.270 --> 02:47:36.095
"We are willing to share information.

3610

"However, it is very apparent that

3611
02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:44.870
"the beginnings of this conflict stems from

3612
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:49.590
"the human Zemnian thirst for

"I hope you understand."

3627

LIAM: I do, I am too presumptuous.

3628
02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:46.400
May I instead retract my request

3629
02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:51.212
and instead just settle upon,

3630
02:48:52.498 --> 02:48:54.920
knowing who this person is.

3631
02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:56.700

on the location of the Burning Lodge?

white salt and sand.

02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:10.393
A temple to the Wildmother.

3650
02:50:11.446 --> 02:50:13.420
MATT: There is a moment of quiet in the room,

3651
02:50:13.420 --> 02:50:17.478
and in consideration from the Bright Queen,

3652
02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:24.260
before Mirimm, the Skysybil, steps forward and goes,

3653
02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:28.912
"A mountain where there is no snow amongst snow.

3654
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:33.660
"There is such a place in the Flotket Alps.

3655
02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:36.412
"The Greying Wildlands.

3656
02:50:40.795 --> 02:50:44.630
"I would have to look into this entity.

3657
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:46.590
"This location."

3658
02:50:46.590 --> 02:50:49.010
TALIESIN: That would be what I seek,

3659
02:50:49.010 --> 02:50:52.452
and the fastest and safest way to travel there.

3660
02:50:53.460 --> 02:50:57.950
MATT: You look over and you can see across the way,

3661
02:50:57.950 --> 02:51:02.400
Essek has been sitting down on one of the chairs, and goes,

3662
02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:05.090
"Well, if a safe and quick means

3663
02:51:05.090 --> 02:51:08.255
"of transportation is required,

3664
02:51:08.255 --> 02:51:12.137
"that would probably be my specialty."

3665
02:51:13.490 --> 02:51:14.800
LAURA: Will you be going with us

3666
02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:16.520
or are you going to be sending us?

3667
02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:19.799
MATT: "Well, I have to come with you at first,

3668
02:51:19.799 --> 02:51:22.120
"but I'll be returning thereafter."

3669
02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:24.070
SAM: That's cool.
LAURA: Maybe you won't be, though,

3670
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:27.494
maybe you'll like us so much you'll just hang out!

3671
02:51:27.494 --> 02:51:30.310
MATT: "There is a lot of business I must attend to as well.

3672
02:51:30.310 --> 02:51:32.180
"As you've heard from the Bright Queen,

3673
02:51:32.180 --> 02:51:33.560
"a lot of things are moving

3674
02:51:33.560 --> 02:51:38.210
"and my interests lie elsewhere beyond a kiln."

3675
02:51:38.210 --> 02:51:41.120
TRAVIS: Indeed, we appreciate your help.

3676
02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:43.520
We will let you return to your

3677
02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:45.540
very pressing matters at hand.

3678
02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:47.440
LAURA: Oh, one last thing.

3679
02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:52.190
Is it possible to send word to the people in--

3680
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:53.030
where were we just?

3681
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:54.870
SAM: Bazzoxan.
LAURA: In Bazzoxan,

3682
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:57.030
because we left our moorbounders there

3683
02:51:57.030 --> 02:51:59.657
because we were in such a hurry to get here.

3684
02:51:59.657 --> 02:52:00.890
I'm afraid they're going to--

3685
02:52:00.890 --> 02:52:03.050
SAM: It's okay.
LAURA: Starve to death.

3686
02:52:03.050 --> 02:52:04.800
TRAVIS: The little death panthers will be fine

3687
02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:06.810
by themselves. It's fine.

3688
02:52:06.810 --> 02:52:08.430
MATT: Bright Queen smiles

3689
02:52:08.430 --> 02:52:10.720
and puts her hand out and says,

3690
02:52:10.720 --> 02:52:13.670
"Your beasts are from these lands, and will be fine,

3691
02:52:14.900 --> 02:52:16.600
"though they may be free

3692
02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:19.533
to pursue their interests elsewhere.

3693
02:52:19.533 --> 02:52:22.715
"Should you require more, we can provide them."

3694
02:52:22.715 --> 02:52:24.840
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

3695
02:52:27.006 --> 02:52:28.838
MATT: At this point, Mirimm goes,

3696
02:52:28.838 --> 02:52:32.577
"Ah! Kravaraad."

3697
02:52:32.577 --> 02:52:33.918
SAM: What?
LAURA: Kravaraad?

3698
02:52:33.918 --> 02:52:37.403
MATT: "That is the mountain you speak of."

3699
02:52:37.403 --> 02:52:38.920
TALIESIN: Kravaraad.

3700
02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:41.928
MATT: "Singular volcano rested

3701
02:52:41.928 --> 02:52:45.702
"in the center of the Flotket Alps,

3702
02:52:45.702 --> 02:52:47.560
"northwest of here."

3703
02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:49.160
TALIESIN: Northwest?

3704
02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:50.350
MATT: "Quite a journey."

3705
02:52:50.350 --> 02:52:52.450
TALIESIN: Yes.

3706
02:52:52.450 --> 02:52:54.775
That is where we need to go.

3707
02:52:54.775 --> 02:52:59.610
MARISHA: My hunch was right.

3708
02:52:59.610 --> 02:53:00.443
TALIESIN: Sure.

3709
02:53:02.161 --> 02:53:03.786
LAURA: Thank you!
MATT: Rescinds back to the

3710
02:53:03.786 --> 02:53:05.242
at the base of her chair and sits down.

3711
02:53:05.242 --> 02:53:06.192
(thumps)

3712
02:53:06.192 --> 02:53:07.810
Her body much smaller in comparison

3713
02:53:07.810 --> 02:53:11.685
to the rest of the chair behind her.

3714
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:14.680
SAM: This was a great meeting.

3715
02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:17.013
LAURA: Yeah, thank you so much for seeing us

3716
02:53:17.013 --> 02:53:17.887
so quickly.
TRAVIS: Make our

3717
02:53:17.887 --> 02:53:18.841
way down to the dungeons?

3718
02:53:18.841 --> 02:53:20.383
SAM: Are we going to go down to the dungeons now?

3719
02:53:20.383 --> 02:53:22.150
Is someone going to escort us?

3720
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:23.400
MATT: "Yes, please."

3721
02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:25.210
She raises her hand and points forward

3722
02:53:25.210 --> 02:53:27.830
and two guards, who are off to the side, step forward

3723
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:31.230
and put their feet together

3724
02:53:31.230 --> 02:53:34.310
and assert themselves as the ones to escort you.

3725
02:53:34.310 --> 02:53:35.843
TRAVIS: After you.

3726
02:53:37.330 --> 02:53:39.450
MARISHA: Can I keep my eyes out?

3727
02:53:39.450 --> 02:53:40.630
Eyes open.

3728
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:43.760
Looking out-- whatever-- as we're walking,

3729
02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:46.060
on the council and on the guards.

3730
02:53:46.060 --> 02:53:48.910
If I see a drow that looks like the way

3731
02:53:48.910 --> 02:53:53.190
that Dairon was disguised, just as we go.

3732
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:54.880
Just as we're here.

3733
02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:56.292
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.

3734
02:53:56.292 --> 02:53:58.430
MARISHA: Okay.

3735
02:54:00.170 --> 02:54:01.930
TRAVIS: Natural one?
MARISHA: No.

3736
02:54:02.780 --> 02:54:04.350
No, it's deceiving. 16.

3737
02:54:04.350 --> 02:54:05.390
MATT: 16, okay.

3738
02:54:05.390 --> 02:54:08.117
You're keeping your eye out.

3739
02:54:08.117 --> 02:54:08.950
LAURA: Did we get a feel,

3740
02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:11.800
did I get a feel during that meeting if

3741
02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:14.430
the Bright Queen was still looking at us

3742
02:54:14.430 --> 02:54:15.980
in the same way as before,

3743
02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:18.530
or if she seemed more suspicious of us now.

3744
02:54:18.530 --> 02:54:20.200
MATT: Make an insight check.

3745
02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:21.033
SAM: Ooh.

3746
02:54:21.985 --> 02:54:23.976
This is a big roll.

3747
02:54:23.976 --> 02:54:24.900
LAURA: (sighs)

3748
02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:25.870
TALIESIN: Yep.

3749
02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:26.703
LAURA: That's good.

3750
02:54:26.703 --> 02:54:27.970
Seven.

3751
02:54:27.970 --> 02:54:29.000
MATT: Oh, seven.

3752
02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.630
LAURA: Yeah, seven, seven whole numbers.

3753
02:54:31.630 --> 02:54:33.081
MATT: Yeah.

3754
02:54:33.081 --> 02:54:34.041
SAM: Number of points.

3755
02:54:34.041 --> 02:54:37.620
MATT: The Bright Queen has lived many lifetimes,

3756
02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:41.630
and in doing so has seemingly perfected,

3757
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:44.160
at least in most of your conversations,

3758
02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:47.560
the ability to mask her intent

3759
02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:52.560
beyond the positive presentation she's giving you this day.

3760
02:54:53.211 --> 02:54:56.458
Beyond that, you're unable to read anything.

3761
02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.930
SAM: All right.

3762
02:54:59.930 --> 02:55:01.715
LAURA: What kind of dress was she in today?

3763
02:55:01.715 --> 02:55:05.800
LIAM: I'm going to float off and towards the back.

3764
02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:06.633
MATT: Okay.

3765
02:55:06.633 --> 02:55:08.460
LAURA: Was she in a sparkly dress today?

3766
02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:10.620
Was she in, what color dress was it?

3767
02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:11.700
MARISHA: Yeah, did she look dope?

3768
02:55:11.700 --> 02:55:13.006
TRAVIS: The queen looked like--

3769
02:55:13.006 --> 02:55:15.285
MATT: She always looks dope. Yeah.

3770
02:55:15.285 --> 02:55:16.330
LAURA: She's got the helmet, but was it like--

3771
02:55:16.330 --> 02:55:18.093
TALIESIN: Dope queen.

3772
02:55:18.093 --> 02:55:19.151
LAURA: Was it a pantsuit?

3773
02:55:19.151 --> 02:55:20.410
TALIESIN: Dope queen.

3774
02:55:20.410 --> 02:55:22.280
MATT: It wasn't a pantsuit.

3775
02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:26.230
It was a variation on the first outfit that you saw her in.

3776
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:30.108
This one was more battle-ready, if that makes sense.

3777
02:55:30.108 --> 02:55:31.280
LAURA: Oh.

3778
02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:32.113
MARISHA: Sick.

3779
02:55:32.113 --> 02:55:35.670
MATT: It seems like as things progress in this conflict,

3780
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:37.860
and based on what was exiting the chamber,

3781
02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:40.730
there is a general, an air of

3782
02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:42.830
riding the high of recent victory.

3783
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:46.150
As that, she's dressed accordingly.

3784
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:50.470
SAM: Can we commission an artist to make her entire wardrobe

3785
02:55:50.470 --> 02:55:53.601
just like in a catalog or something?

3786
02:55:53.601 --> 02:55:55.680
(laughter)

3787
02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:56.513
MATT: Sure.

3788
02:55:56.513 --> 02:55:57.700
TALIESIN: We can take it to that shop.

3789
02:55:57.700 --> 02:55:58.730
A shop exists.

3790
02:55:58.730 --> 02:55:59.563
MATT: Yeah.

3791
02:55:59.563 --> 02:56:00.396
TALIESIN: We've been there.

3792
02:56:00.396 --> 02:56:01.712
MATT: Yeah. I think Vanessa makes them.

3793
02:56:01.712 --> 02:56:03.270
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3794
02:56:03.270 --> 02:56:05.037
MATT: Creature of Habit on--

3795
02:56:05.037 --> 02:56:06.278
(laughter)

3796
02:56:06.278 --> 02:56:07.978
on Instagram.

3797
02:56:09.702 --> 02:56:12.560
You guys are escorted out of the chamber

3798
02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:14.510
outside of the Lucid Bastion,

3799
02:56:14.510 --> 02:56:17.560
back below to the Shadowshire

3800
02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:20.926
which rests beneath the city.

3801
02:56:20.926 --> 02:56:22.817
There,

3802
02:56:23.734 --> 02:56:26.760
you briskly walk past the strange, glowing fields

3803
02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:28.830
of luminescent crops that line the floor

3804
02:56:28.830 --> 02:56:30.900
and the ceiling of the cavern,

3805
02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:33.530
venturing back to the familiar entrance on the side

3806
02:56:33.530 --> 02:56:37.850
to the dark prison that once held Yeza.

3807
02:56:37.850 --> 02:56:40.640
You approach the gate-like doors that bar your entry.

3808
02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:44.085
A well-armed Dynasty orc guard narrows his eyes towards you

3809
02:56:44.085 --> 02:56:46.920
and is about to approach before the two guards flanking

3810
02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:49.660
who are both wearing a very elaborate

3811
02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:53.413
captain capelets on the left arm,

3812
02:56:53.413 --> 02:56:56.548
stands down immediately and doesn't even get a word out.

3813
02:56:56.548 --> 02:56:57.920
Opens the door.

3814
02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:02.920
You guys are led in down four levels of this dungeon,

3815
02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:05.700
with each growing progressively darker

3816
02:57:05.700 --> 02:57:10.510
and more heinous.

3817
02:57:10.510 --> 02:57:11.780
MARISHA: Max security?

3818
02:57:11.780 --> 02:57:13.113
MATT: Yeah.

3819
02:57:13.113 --> 02:57:14.712
TALIESIN: The Daisy parking level at Disneyland.

3820
02:57:14.712 --> 02:57:17.100
TRAVIS: Are we getting slowed this time?

3821
02:57:17.100 --> 02:57:19.200
Or altered, the way we were the first time

3822
02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:20.770
we were brought down here?

3823
02:57:20.770 --> 02:57:22.920
MATT: Right.

3824
02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:26.990
As you go further and further down within the chambers,

3825
02:57:26.990 --> 02:57:28.250
there's just a general

3826
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:30.690
loose sense of nausea that comes over you,

3827
02:57:30.690 --> 02:57:33.270
like your equilibrium is slightly off.

3828
02:57:33.270 --> 02:57:34.200
It's hard to describe.

3829
02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:35.520
TRAVIS: Just in the space.

3830
02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:37.570
Because Essek is not with us this time.

3831
02:57:37.570 --> 02:57:38.650
MATT: Correct.

3832
02:57:38.650 --> 02:57:41.970
This is just the further down you go,

3833
02:57:41.970 --> 02:57:44.610
it's just like a sick feeling in your stomach

3834
02:57:44.610 --> 02:57:46.772
that seems to grow.

3835
02:57:48.236 --> 02:57:50.370
You begin to move from hallway to hallway

3836
02:57:50.370 --> 02:57:53.100
but in a very M. C. Escher way,

3837
02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:55.280
the stairways seem to shift

3838
02:57:55.280 --> 02:57:58.071
and entryways seem to

3839
02:57:58.071 --> 02:58:03.038
not follow familiar gravity.

3840
02:58:03.038 --> 02:58:04.670
In a short distance,

3841
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:07.000
you are having a hard time recalling,

3842
02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.340
except for Caleb,

3843
02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:11.595
directly how you entered.

3844
02:58:11.595 --> 02:58:14.070
You begin to imagine that elements of this prison

3845
02:58:14.070 --> 02:58:15.750
are designed to be maze-like

3846
02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:20.200
to aid in keeping people from escaping.

3847
02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:21.640
MARISHA: What level was Yeza on?

3848
02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:23.710
Just for comparison?

3849
02:58:23.710 --> 02:58:26.150
MATT: Yeza was between the first and second level,

3850
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:27.880
like around the cusp of that area.

3851
02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:29.350
SAM: He's dangerous!

3852
02:58:29.350 --> 02:58:30.540
He's a flight risk!

3853
02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:32.622
MARISHA: Of course, level two!

3854
02:58:32.622 --> 02:58:35.420
SAM: He's got--
TRAVIS: No. No, he's not.

3855
02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:37.530
SAM: They took all sharp objects from him.

3856
02:58:37.530 --> 02:58:39.310
He wasn't wearing shoelaces.

3857
02:58:39.310 --> 02:58:40.840
They don't know what he's capable of.

3858
02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:42.150
TRAVIS: He didn't have shoes.

3859
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:45.350
SAM: Yeah, well, that's because he's crazy.

3860
02:58:45.350 --> 02:58:46.390
Could kill with a shoe.

3861
02:58:46.390 --> 02:58:48.074
TRAVIS: Crazy boring.

3862
02:58:48.074 --> 02:58:49.932
MARISHA: Aww.

3863
02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:51.633
SAM: You're boring.

3864
02:58:51.633 --> 02:58:53.146
Your face is boring.

3865
02:58:53.146 --> 02:58:54.220
Shut up.

3866
02:58:54.220 --> 02:58:55.836
I hate you.

3867
02:58:57.990 --> 02:59:01.540
MATT: As you're led into this fourth, and deeper, floor

3868
02:59:01.540 --> 02:59:03.250
of the Dungeon of Penance,

3869
02:59:03.250 --> 02:59:05.590
you are brought too this heavily guarded,

3870
02:59:05.590 --> 02:59:07.600
you can see six guards sitting outside

3871
02:59:07.600 --> 02:59:11.300
of this single, 10-foot wide wall.

3872
02:59:11.300 --> 02:59:13.490
There is a doorway that has about

3873
02:59:13.490 --> 02:59:16.340
a six by two inch slot in the top of it.

3874
02:59:16.340 --> 02:59:19.350
It is dark entirely on the interior.

3875
02:59:19.350 --> 02:59:21.910
The two guards that are leading you through stop

3876
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:25.738
and give an acknowledgement to those that are keeping guard.

3877
02:59:25.738 --> 02:59:28.113
Do any of you speak Undercommon?

3878
02:59:30.340 --> 02:59:31.173
SAM: No.

3879
02:59:31.173 --> 02:59:32.798
MATT: Crickets. All right.

3880
02:59:32.798 --> 02:59:36.761
There are some words exchanged none of you understand.

3881
02:59:36.761 --> 02:59:40.190
The guards step out from the front of the door

3882
02:59:40.190 --> 02:59:44.265
and you are given essentially a position to look in.

3883
02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:47.840
LIAM: But it's pitch dark in there.

3884
02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:49.070
MATT: There's no light on the interior.

3885
02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:51.560
TRAVIS: I'll step up, I got darkvision.

3886
02:59:51.560 --> 02:59:53.580
MATT: Most of this entire dungeon has no light.

3887
02:59:53.580 --> 02:59:55.620
SAM: We need the humans to see who's in there.

3888
02:59:55.620 --> 02:59:57.430
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah, I'll step up.

3889
02:59:57.430 --> 03:00:01.197
LAURA: Well, why doesn't Caleb just send in some light?

3890
03:00:01.197 --> 03:00:03.020
LIAM: No, I will not do that,

3891
03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:07.560
I will burn some transmutation magic to make the,

3892
03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:09.170
maybe I did this already, doesn't matter,

3893
03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:11.790
the transmuter stone to give me darkvision.

3894
03:00:11.790 --> 03:00:12.623
MATT: Okay.

3895
03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:17.053
So who approaches?

3896
03:00:17.053 --> 03:00:18.870
TRAVIS: Apparently I don't, somebody else does if you ask--

3897
03:00:18.870 --> 03:00:20.470
SAM: Go on.
LAURA: Go, go, go!

3898
03:00:20.470 --> 03:00:21.440
Yeah, do it, Fjord.

3899
03:00:21.440 --> 03:00:22.530
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll step up.

3900
03:00:22.530 --> 03:00:25.037
MATT: Okay, you step up and glance through.

3901
03:00:25.037 --> 03:00:26.340
From what you can see, this,

3902
03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:28.330
it's a 10-foot by 10-foot chamber.

3903
03:00:28.330 --> 03:00:30.490
There is a single chair in the very center

3904
03:00:30.490 --> 03:00:35.490
and you can see a humanoid female form

3905
03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:37.031
sitting in the chair,

3906
03:00:37.031 --> 03:00:39.900
faced to the side and away towards the corner,

3907
03:00:39.900 --> 03:00:42.330
arms bound behind by shackles,

3908
03:00:42.330 --> 03:00:43.940
shackles then follow a chain down

3909
03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:46.320
that is chained to the bottom of the chair.

3910
03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:49.070
You can see chains that then fix themselves

3911
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:51.200
to the ankles in the front.

3912
03:00:51.200 --> 03:00:55.268
This figure is locked tight to this chair.

3913
03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:57.240
Also looking down to the base of the chair,

3914
03:00:57.240 --> 03:00:59.000
the chair itself is bolted to the floor,

3915
03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:03.010
so it is a stationary, affixed chair.

3916
03:01:03.010 --> 03:01:07.970
There is no other exit windows, it is just pitch black.

3917
03:01:07.970 --> 03:01:11.010
Faint smell of urine, from what you can see,

3918
03:01:11.010 --> 03:01:14.885
she is very, very badly beaten.

3919
03:01:17.310 --> 03:01:18.790
That's about as much as you can make out.

3920
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:21.160
Hair in front of the face.

3921
03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:22.170
TRAVIS: Clothed?

3922
03:01:22.170 --> 03:01:25.530
MATT: Clothed, leather armor, but a lot of it's been cut.

3923
03:01:25.530 --> 03:01:27.050
Elements have been torn off

3924
03:01:27.050 --> 03:01:31.587
where the arm is, there, battle-worn.

3925
03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:34.318
TRAVIS: Look at me.

3926
03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:37.730
Does her head lift?

3927
03:01:37.730 --> 03:01:38.563
MATT: No.

3928
03:01:40.060 --> 03:01:41.770
TRAVIS: I'll pivot and turn around.

3929
03:01:41.770 --> 03:01:42.603
Caleb.

3930
03:01:46.580 --> 03:01:51.310
LIAM: I'll walk up next to Fjord and look in.

3931
03:01:51.310 --> 03:01:54.910
What does this woman look like?

3932
03:01:54.910 --> 03:01:57.160
TRAVIS: Well, she's had the shit kicked out of her.

3933
03:01:57.160 --> 03:01:59.000
Hair's all in her face.

3934
03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.695
It doesn't look like she's very comfy.

3935
03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:06.830
LIAM: I look in. My eyes go to the hole and I look in.

3936
03:02:06.830 --> 03:02:10.120
MATT: Okay, you see the same thing that Fjord had seen.

3937
03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:13.520
LIAM: What does the hair look like?

3938
03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:18.150
MATT: It looks probably about just under shoulder length,

3939
03:02:18.150 --> 03:02:20.380
about chin length, maybe a little beyond that.

3940
03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:25.110
Most of it's tousled and mostly over the face,

3941
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:26.530
the head is slumped forward,

3942
03:02:26.530 --> 03:02:30.035
you don't know if she's unconscious or is just exhausted.

3943
03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:33.670
LIAM: There are guards here, you said?

3944
03:02:33.670 --> 03:02:35.060
MATT: Yes.

3945
03:02:35.060 --> 03:02:36.600
LIAM: I turn to them.

3946
03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:37.460
Is light allowed?

3947
03:02:38.770 --> 03:02:39.746
May I?

3948
03:02:39.746 --> 03:02:42.273
MATT: They all look at each other and,

3949
03:02:42.273 --> 03:02:45.384
one of them gestures to go ahead.

3950
03:02:45.384 --> 03:02:48.130
LIAM: Fumph, fumph, fumph.

3951
03:02:48.130 --> 03:02:50.410
Two of them float in through the hole

3952
03:02:50.410 --> 03:02:54.428
and move not close to the person, but

3953
03:02:54.428 --> 03:02:57.090
over their head so as not to wake them up.

3954
03:02:57.090 --> 03:02:57.923
MATT: Okay.

3955
03:02:57.923 --> 03:03:02.200
You can see a very faint physical reaction

3956
03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:04.100
to the light in the chamber, but it's very faint.

3957
03:03:04.100 --> 03:03:07.510
It's just a slight shift,

3958
03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:10.296
but maintains position.

3959
03:03:10.296 --> 03:03:12.545
LIAM: I speak in Zemnian.

3960
03:03:15.070 --> 03:03:17.186
(American accent) Are you awake?

3961
03:03:23.610 --> 03:03:24.893
MATT: No response.

3962
03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:33.410
LIAM: Wake up.

3963
03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:40.125
You are in a bad place, I need you to talk to me.

3964
03:03:41.419 --> 03:03:42.610
MATT: "(coughs)"

3965
03:03:42.610 --> 03:03:44.960
You hear her clear her throat.

3966
03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:54.875
LIAM: Go ahead.

3967
03:03:58.070 --> 03:04:01.680
Your life's thread is very short right now.

3968
03:04:03.950 --> 03:04:06.140
If you want to keep it from being clipped,

3969
03:04:06.140 --> 03:04:09.183
I need you to talk to me.

3970
03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:16.820
MATT: You hear this reedy, pinched voice come out,

3971
03:04:17.490 --> 03:04:19.440
the face still not turning, just going,

3972
03:04:23.090 --> 03:04:24.240
in Zemnian back to you,

3973
03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:28.603
"It is what it is.

3974
03:04:30.450 --> 03:04:32.892
"This is what happens in war."

3975
03:04:36.720 --> 03:04:40.320
LIAM: I don't recognize the voice, do I?

3976
03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:42.037
MATT: Make a perception check.

3977
03:04:45.495 --> 03:04:47.136
It's very...

3978
03:04:48.897 --> 03:04:51.500
LAURA: Aw!

3979
03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:53.160
MATT: You're not sure.

3980
03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:55.270
It sounds like the individual's taken quite a few hits

3981
03:04:55.270 --> 03:04:57.880
to probably the throat or chest, and is just,

3982
03:04:57.880 --> 03:05:02.340
the process of speaking is a taxing endeavor.

3983
03:05:06.810 --> 03:05:10.135
LIAM: Can you look at me?

3984
03:05:11.220 --> 03:05:13.453
MATT: "Who asks?

3985
03:05:14.850 --> 03:05:16.737
"What do you want?"

3986
03:05:18.060 --> 03:05:21.330
LIAM: You hear me talking to you in this language.

3987
03:05:21.330 --> 03:05:23.530
In this place.

3988
03:05:25.130 --> 03:05:28.070
Do you want an aid or not?

3989
03:05:29.560 --> 03:05:32.330
Look at me.

3990
03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:35.210
MATT: "Magic can do many things.

3991
03:05:35.210 --> 03:05:37.355
"My life is already forfeit.

3992
03:05:38.500 --> 03:05:41.967
"Try what you want, you won't break me."

3993
03:05:54.930 --> 03:05:56.705
LIAM: Astrid.

3994
03:06:00.470 --> 03:06:02.312
MATT: What did you say?

3995
03:06:02.312 --> 03:06:04.360
SAM: Astrid.

3996
03:06:06.460 --> 03:06:08.610
MATT: The head perks up slightly.

3997
03:06:10.660 --> 03:06:12.410
"What did you say?"

3998
03:06:15.670 --> 03:06:19.280
LIAM: You heard me.

3999
03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:22.627
Look me in the eye.

4000
03:06:27.990 --> 03:06:29.973
MATT: "Who are you?"

4001
03:06:34.059 --> 03:06:36.476
LIAM: I don't have time for that.

4002
03:06:37.828 --> 03:06:40.260
Lift your face.

4003
03:06:40.260 --> 03:06:43.220
Your life hangs by a thread, what have you to lose?

4004
03:06:44.570 --> 03:06:46.210
Look at me.

4005
03:06:46.210 --> 03:06:48.730
MATT: "Look where I am.

4006
03:06:48.730 --> 03:06:51.388
"Who do I have to trust?

4007
03:06:52.340 --> 03:06:55.360
"Who is this who knows Astrid?"

4008
03:06:59.610 --> 03:07:04.552
LIAM: If I try to put my cat in that room, am I able to now?

4009
03:07:09.640 --> 03:07:11.798
MATT: I think you probably can.

4010
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:17.710
LIAM: I attempt it and put Frumpkin
on the inside of the room.

4011
03:07:17.940 --> 03:07:18.773
MATT: All righty.

4012
03:07:18.773 --> 03:07:22.000
LIAM: He's in there, I send him padding

4013
03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:25.162
up to this person to look.

4014
03:07:27.470 --> 03:07:28.720
MATT: Okay.

4015
03:07:28.720 --> 03:07:31.462
Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

4016
03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:39.595
LIAM: Oh, for Frumpkin. Balls.

4017
03:07:40.930 --> 03:07:43.180
(laughter)

4018
03:07:44.850 --> 03:07:45.966
Ten.

4019
03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:47.940
SAM: Okay, okay.

4020
03:07:47.940 --> 03:07:49.680
MARISHA: We'll go with 10.

4021
03:07:49.680 --> 03:07:53.720
MATT: You see the hair in front of the face.

4022
03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:58.495
You see a lot of blood and a swollen chin and a lip.

4023
03:07:59.680 --> 03:08:02.458
SAM: Beau, go in there and just beat the shit out of her.

4024
03:08:02.458 --> 03:08:05.292
Hold her face up.

4025
03:08:05.292 --> 03:08:07.330
MARISHA: We have to be let inside.

4026
03:08:07.330 --> 03:08:08.862
May have to open the gate.

4027
03:08:08.862 --> 03:08:12.480
MATT: You do see in the light here,

4028
03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:16.640
and the circumstances, there are scars across the forearm,

4029
03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:19.682
familiar scars as the ones that you carry.

4030
03:08:19.682 --> 03:08:21.100
LIAM: Yeah.

4031
03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:23.340
MARISHA: There's no way they're opening this door for us.

4032
03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:27.160
LIAM: I ask that very thing of the guards.

4033
03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:28.086
MATT: If they'll open it?

4034
03:08:28.086 --> 03:08:30.302
LIAM: Yeah.

4035
03:08:30.302 --> 03:08:32.460
MATT: The one who's assigned next to it goes,

4036
03:08:32.460 --> 03:08:35.260
"I am sorry, that cannot be done."

4037
03:08:40.318 --> 03:08:42.990
MARISHA: It looks to tempting!

4038
03:08:42.990 --> 03:08:45.340
SAM: We could just knock up these guards real quick.

4039
03:08:45.340 --> 03:08:47.100
TALIESIN: Would you perhaps mind if--
MARISHA: There's so many.

4040
03:08:47.100 --> 03:08:50.562
TALIESIN: Perhaps, mind if I put the prisoner in

4041
03:08:50.562 --> 03:08:52.170
a better state to answer questions?

4042
03:08:52.170 --> 03:08:53.511
They've been roughed up a bit.

4043
03:08:53.511 --> 03:08:58.498
LIAM: Do you know Bren Aldric Ermendrud?

4044
03:08:59.560 --> 03:09:01.501
MATT: "Very well."

4045
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:05.631
LIAM: "Who was he?"

4046
03:09:16.740 --> 03:09:18.870
MATT: "I don't know.

4047
03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:20.670
"Is he you?"

4048
03:09:20.670 --> 03:09:22.601
And the figure turns and looks in your direction.

4049
03:09:22.601 --> 03:09:24.150
(gasping)

4050
03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:27.120
You see the hair pushed to one side of the face.

4051
03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:31.870
The hair is dark, not brown,

4052
03:09:31.870 --> 03:09:34.512
and the face is unfamiliar to you.

4053
03:09:34.512 --> 03:09:36.750
This is not Astrid,

4054
03:09:37.750 --> 03:09:41.068
but the face is looking right at you with a smile.

4055
03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:49.498
LIAM: We'll ind them both,

4056
03:09:52.012 --> 03:09:54.429
and kill them. Hmm?

4057
03:09:55.716 --> 03:09:58.564
MATT: "I've heard things about you, Bren.

4058
03:10:01.470 --> 03:10:03.461
"Welcome back."

4059
03:10:09.250 --> 03:10:12.475
LIAM: I'm curious of your knowledge about this boy.

4060
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:19.332
We'll see if you live long enough to tell me.

4061
03:10:20.930 --> 03:10:22.960
I walk away from the door,

4062
03:10:22.960 --> 03:10:26.220
and start to hyperventilate against the wall.

4063
03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:32.540
TRAVIS: Caleb, is everything all right?

4064
03:10:32.540 --> 03:10:34.240
You don't seem well.

4065
03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:37.110
LAURA: I peek through the hole.

4066
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:39.830
MATT: She's still looking forward, just grinning.

4067
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:42.450
You can see the very pale white skin,

4068
03:10:42.450 --> 03:10:44.190
dark hair that's covering

4069
03:10:44.190 --> 03:10:46.180
most of one side of the face entirely to one side,

4070
03:10:46.180 --> 03:10:48.920
a single eye that's peeking up with a smile.

4071
03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:50.200
Then she's looking back at you,

4072
03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:51.760
with the blood streaking out of the nose

4073
03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:54.739
and the mouth, swollen.

4074
03:10:54.739 --> 03:10:56.550
TRAVIS: Do you know this person?

4075
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:57.960
MARISHA: Fuck.

4076
03:10:57.960 --> 03:10:59.983
LIAM: She's a murderer.

4077
03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:04.225
She's one of my own.

4078
03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:10.020
She is me if I had turned out to be me.

4079
03:11:11.977 --> 03:11:14.540
TRAVIS: Do you know her personally?

4080
03:11:14.540 --> 03:11:17.195
Are we--
LIAM: No.

4081
03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:21.300
She's one of many.

4082
03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:22.650
TRAVIS: Right.

4083
03:11:24.590 --> 03:11:25.423
Are we done here?

4084
03:11:25.423 --> 03:11:27.680
SAM: I guess so.

4085
03:11:27.680 --> 03:11:30.132
MARISHA: Is there any other information we can get from her?

4086
03:11:30.132 --> 03:11:30.965
SAM: Do you want to ask her about

4087
03:11:30.965 --> 03:11:34.738
any of the people who you used to know?

4088
03:11:37.081 --> 03:11:38.914
This is a chance.

4089
03:11:49.825 --> 03:11:52.077
LIAM: Magic worked in here, when I used it?

4090
03:11:52.077 --> 03:11:52.910
TRAVIS and MATT: Yes.

4091
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:55.080
LIAM: Just Frumpkin.

4092
03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:58.800
MATT: Just Frumpkin and the lights you put in there, yeah.

4093
03:11:58.800 --> 03:11:59.633
LIAM: Yeah.

4094
03:12:03.070 --> 03:12:03.903
Gah.

4095
03:12:05.185 --> 03:12:07.552
I walk back over to the door.

4096
03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:11.666
(American accent) From what I understand,

4097
03:12:11.666 --> 03:12:13.691
your time is limited.

4098
03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:16.528
Very limited.

4099
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:22.988
Care to contribute anything to the conversation?

4100
03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:29.290
MATT: "Not particularly.

4101
03:12:29.290 --> 03:12:32.735
"I'm just waiting for my sentence."

4102
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:39.557
LIAM: It has a period on the end.

4103
03:12:42.660 --> 03:12:46.635
MATT: "I will say, it's fascinating

4104
03:12:47.640 --> 03:12:51.098
"to see who's now working with the other side."

4105
03:12:55.451 --> 03:12:57.300
MARISHA: Does that mean there's...

4106
03:12:57.300 --> 03:12:59.240
Does that mean there's multiple?

4107
03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:01.640
TRAVIS: She's talking about Caleb.

4108
03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:06.435
LIAM: Some of us get tired of macabre fairy tales.

4109
03:13:08.110 --> 03:13:13.110
So you enjoy your mouthful of lies,

4110
03:13:13.130 --> 03:13:17.105
when they choke it out of you.

4111
03:13:19.300 --> 03:13:23.105
I stride up the hall and away from the group.

4112
03:13:23.105 --> 03:13:24.601
Back the way we came.

4113
03:13:24.601 --> 03:13:26.184
TRAVIS: That's our cue.

4114
03:13:27.463 --> 03:13:29.215
SAM: Pleasure to meet you!

4115
03:13:29.215 --> 03:13:31.646
(laughter)

4116
03:13:31.646 --> 03:13:32.987
TALIESIN: That was very nice.

4117
03:13:32.987 --> 03:13:35.070
LAURA: Thank you, guards.

4118
03:13:36.787 --> 03:13:39.338
MATT: They acknowledge, then get back to their positions.

4119
03:13:39.338 --> 03:13:41.488
SAM: Should we tip them or something? I don't know.

4120
03:13:41.488 --> 03:13:45.201
TALIESIN: Traditionally, you're supposed to. Five gold?

4121
03:13:45.201 --> 03:13:46.310
LIAM: I yank Frumpkin with me

4122
03:13:46.310 --> 03:13:49.070
who's now scarfing around my neck.

4123
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.913
You got it.

4124
03:13:49.913 --> 03:13:52.390
TALIESIN: Five people, that's [inaudible]

4125
03:13:52.390 --> 03:13:53.440
TRAVIS: Well.

4126
03:13:53.440 --> 03:13:55.182
SAM: Well, that was--

4127
03:13:56.102 --> 03:14:00.660
TRAVIS: I think we ask for some expeditious travel up north.

4128
03:14:00.660 --> 03:14:03.840
TALIESIN: I think we head home, get ready,

4129
03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:05.260
get some preparations.

4130
03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:06.830
SAM: I would love to--

4131
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:10.130
TRAVIS: Maybe the Dunrock Mountains or Quannah Breach?

4132
03:14:10.130 --> 03:14:12.320
LAURA: We could, you know, walk to--

4133
03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:17.320
SAM: Love to take my husband back to good old safety.

4134
03:14:17.340 --> 03:14:19.560
LAURA: Caleb, would that be something that we can do?

4135
03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:21.310
TALIESIN: Teleport him there at very least.

4136
03:14:22.450 --> 03:14:23.510
LIAM: I'm sorry.

4137
03:14:23.510 --> 03:14:26.250
SAM: You can't teleport today, I know.

4138
03:14:26.250 --> 03:14:27.750
LAURA: But in the morning, could you maybe

4139
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:30.260
teleport Yeza to Nicodranas?

4140
03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:33.033
LIAM: Yeah.

4141
03:14:34.400 --> 03:14:35.620
SAM: Yes?

4142
03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:36.770
LIAM: Yeah.

4143
03:14:36.770 --> 03:14:39.010
Are we all going?

4144
03:14:39.010 --> 03:14:41.068
SAM: I would want to go to make sure

4145
03:14:41.068 --> 03:14:43.851
that he gets there safely.

4146
03:14:43.851 --> 03:14:46.600
I don't know if Jester wants to go see her mom.

4147
03:14:46.600 --> 03:14:49.765
I know we've got pressing matters ahead.

4148
03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:52.718
You guys could go on without me

4149
03:14:52.718 --> 03:14:55.076
and I could probably catch up.

4150
03:14:56.220 --> 03:14:58.640
If you needed to.
LAURA: Nott.

4151
03:14:58.640 --> 03:14:59.650
SAM: Well, I'm just saying.

4152
03:14:59.650 --> 03:15:00.570
LAURA: Please don't leave us.

4153
03:15:00.570 --> 03:15:01.403
SAM: I'm not leaving you,

4154
03:15:01.403 --> 03:15:02.823
I'm just saying I could catch up later.

4155
03:15:02.823 --> 03:15:04.158
LAURA: We can't lose you, Nott.

4156
03:15:04.158 --> 03:15:05.565
SAM: We're not losing anyone.

4157
03:15:05.565 --> 03:15:06.581
LAURA: Nott!

4158
03:15:06.581 --> 03:15:07.980
MARISHA: It is a lot of travel.

4159
03:15:07.980 --> 03:15:09.420
TALIESIN: There's just sending somebody through

4160
03:15:09.420 --> 03:15:13.592
and then getting to confirm that they're fine.

4161
03:15:13.592 --> 03:15:16.367
It's doable, you don't have to,

4162
03:15:16.367 --> 03:15:17.490
We don't necessarily all have to go

4163
03:15:17.490 --> 03:15:19.263
and then all have to come back.

4164
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.863
MARISHA: Could try and stay here

4165
03:15:21.863 --> 03:15:23.079
and prepare a little bit more.

4166
03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:27.587
I should probably get in contact with Dairon

4167
03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:31.380
so I don't get thrown out of the Reserve.

4168
03:15:32.300 --> 03:15:34.660
SAM: Maybe Caleb could come

4169
03:15:34.660 --> 03:15:37.752
and then we come back the next day or something.

4170
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:41.810
MARISHA: I also wouldn't mind checking in with Waccoh again.

4171
03:15:41.810 --> 03:15:44.532
Waccoh?
LIAM: Waccoh.

4172
03:15:46.044 --> 03:15:51.044
LIAM: I also want to find Thelyss

4173
03:15:51.044 --> 03:15:53.060
before we leave.

4174
03:15:53.060 --> 03:15:54.790
Sometime before we leave.

4175
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:56.430
LAURA: Oh, Essek.

4176
03:15:56.430 --> 03:15:58.220
LIAM: Yeah, Essek Thelyss.

4177
03:15:58.220 --> 03:15:59.950
LAURA: Yeah, well, we're not, I mean,

4178
03:15:59.950 --> 03:16:01.860
we have to wait till tomorrow, right,

4179
03:16:01.860 --> 03:16:03.710
before we can go?

4180
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:05.180
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

4181
03:16:05.180 --> 03:16:08.978
You've got time.

4182
03:16:08.978 --> 03:16:10.590
LIAM: I'm sorry.

4183
03:16:10.590 --> 03:16:13.080
I need to clear my head.

4184
03:16:13.080 --> 03:16:14.730
SAM: Let's go back to the treehouse.

4185
03:16:14.730 --> 03:16:17.858
LIAM: See you back at the--
TRAVIS: Xhorhaus.

4186
03:16:17.858 --> 03:16:21.054
SAM: Xhorhaus, yes.

4187
03:16:21.054 --> 03:16:22.462
MATT: All right.

4188
03:16:23.300 --> 03:16:25.960
You guys are escorted through the Shadowshire

4189
03:16:25.960 --> 03:16:28.450
back to the surface of Rosohna.

4190
03:16:28.450 --> 03:16:32.053
The still, eternally-midnight sky above,

4191
03:16:32.053 --> 03:16:34.920
and brought back to the exterior of the Xhorhaus

4192
03:16:34.920 --> 03:16:36.310
that you guys have been granted.

4193
03:16:36.310 --> 03:16:39.860
The tree kept well, the lights still glittering above,

4194
03:16:39.860 --> 03:16:43.059
like a majestic beacon above the neighborhood.

4195
03:16:43.059 --> 03:16:45.309
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah!

4196
03:16:47.010 --> 03:16:49.600
MATT: Caleb, are you with them or are you moving on?

4197
03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:54.100
LIAM: No, I'm just wandering with the medallion hanging out

4198
03:16:54.100 --> 03:16:57.656
so I don't get beaten up.

4199
03:16:57.656 --> 03:16:59.830
I start to inquire where Thelyss

4200
03:16:59.830 --> 03:17:02.070
might be with different people.

4201
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.903
MATT: Okay.

4202
03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:06.090
You guys return, you make your way to the front doors,

4203
03:17:06.090 --> 03:17:10.380
you open up the inside. There's candles lit,

4204
03:17:10.380 --> 03:17:13.380
the place is spick and span.

4205
03:17:13.380 --> 03:17:17.320
It is clean, the furniture's been slightly rearranged.

4206
03:17:17.320 --> 03:17:18.153
MARISHA: Oh.

4207
03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:22.090
MATT: There's a moment where you hear something drop,

4208
03:17:22.090 --> 03:17:24.931
the pan of some kind, ping, pang pang pang.

4209
03:17:24.931 --> 03:17:26.220
(thumping)

4210
03:17:26.220 --> 03:17:29.911
Rushing around the corner, apron on, you see Yeza.

4211
03:17:29.911 --> 03:17:31.650
"Huh, you're back?"

4212
03:17:31.650 --> 03:17:33.378
SAM: We're back! We're back!

4213
03:17:33.378 --> 03:17:34.720
Hi!
MATT: Just rushes up

4214
03:17:34.720 --> 03:17:37.340
and just grabs Nott, picks her up.

4215
03:17:37.340 --> 03:17:39.510
MARISHA: Did you hear we were coming, this is all--

4216
03:17:39.510 --> 03:17:41.260
SAM: We made a big, there's a bell--

4217
03:17:41.260 --> 03:17:42.770
LAURA: There's a chime, remember, on the door.

4218
03:17:42.770 --> 03:17:43.800
TALIESIN: A little bell on the door.

4219
03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:45.230
MARISHA: Yeah, he didn't have any time

4220
03:17:45.230 --> 03:17:47.200
to light all the candles that quickly?

4221
03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:48.100
Is this--

4222
03:17:48.100 --> 03:17:51.070
MATT: "Well no, I just, you know, for ambiance.

4223
03:17:51.070 --> 03:17:53.990
"I like to keep it good for myself.

4224
03:17:53.990 --> 03:17:56.890
"I've been here alone for a few days here

4225
03:17:56.890 --> 03:17:57.723
"and I'm just, you know."

4226
03:17:57.723 --> 03:17:59.894
SAM: Yeah, anything weird happen while we were gone?

4227
03:17:59.894 --> 03:18:02.630
MATT: "Uh, not, I mean..."

4228
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:03.650
SAM: Any soldiers come by?

4229
03:18:03.650 --> 03:18:04.940
MATT: "Standard weird.

4230
03:18:07.505 --> 03:18:10.470
"I think occasionally there were,

4231
03:18:11.505 --> 03:18:14.530
"I think twice, some of the Kryn came by

4232
03:18:14.530 --> 03:18:17.220
"and just checked to see if you'd returned."

4233
03:18:17.220 --> 03:18:18.053
SAM: Oh.
MATT: "I said no, you haven't.

4234
03:18:20.620 --> 03:18:22.640
"I was a little scared.

4235
03:18:25.515 --> 03:18:29.950
"I found out that the little garden upstairs

4236
03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:34.401
"actually has some great forms of tea leaf that are--

4237
03:18:34.401 --> 03:18:36.320
"easily strained.

4238
03:18:36.320 --> 03:18:38.750
"I can make a batch for everybody here, if you'd like."

4239
03:18:38.750 --> 03:18:40.220
SAM: Yes, please!

4240
03:18:40.220 --> 03:18:41.110
TALIESIN: I would love to--
MATT: "Of course!"

4241
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:43.340
TALIESIN: Maybe set that up upstairs,

4242
03:18:43.340 --> 03:18:45.410
in the garden upstairs.

4243
03:18:45.410 --> 03:18:47.720
MATT: "Drink, yeah.

4244
03:18:47.720 --> 03:18:51.320
"Where's Caleb and Yasha?"

4245
03:18:51.320 --> 03:18:52.153
TRAVIS: Well...

4246
03:18:53.320 --> 03:18:54.770
LAURA: Caleb wandered off, because--

4247
03:18:54.770 --> 03:18:57.040
SAM: Yeah, he's coming, Caleb will be here later.

4248
03:18:57.040 --> 03:18:58.510
LAURA: He's distraught.

4249
03:18:58.510 --> 03:19:01.910
SAM: Yasha, um, you know.

4250
03:19:03.390 --> 03:19:06.160
Isn't with us right now.

4251
03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:07.410
LAURA: Yasha left us.

4252
03:19:07.410 --> 03:19:10.470
MARISHA: She always wandered in and out.

4253
03:19:10.470 --> 03:19:14.000
You know, she's just handling some of her own stuff

4254
03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:14.990
for now.
MATT: "Right!

4255
03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:16.390
"Understood.

4256
03:19:16.390 --> 03:19:18.150
"I get caught up in my business sometimes, too.

4257
03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:19.910
"It makes a lot of sense."

4258
03:19:19.910 --> 03:19:21.768
LAURA: Does it make you go totally crazy

4259
03:19:21.768 --> 03:19:24.700
and try to kill people?

4260
03:19:24.700 --> 03:19:26.450
MATT: "Not yet."

4261
03:19:26.450 --> 03:19:28.060
LAURA: You never know.

4262
03:19:28.060 --> 03:19:29.560
TALIESIN: You never know.

4263
03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:32.600
MATT: "Well anyway, let me go ahead and get that tea ready."

4264
03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:33.980
SAM: I'll help you.

4265
03:19:33.980 --> 03:19:34.820
MATT: "All right, come on!"

4266
03:19:34.820 --> 03:19:38.382
TALIESIN: I head upstairs.
MATT: All right.

4267
03:19:38.382 --> 03:19:40.047
Yeza's taken care of this place in your absence.

4268
03:19:40.047 --> 03:19:42.960
TRAVIS: I'll follow Caduceus upstairs.

4269
03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:45.760
LAURA: I'll walk very slowly upstairs.

4270
03:19:46.620 --> 03:19:49.640
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll convene for tea in the garden.

4271
03:19:49.640 --> 03:19:53.030
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a piece of wood from the tree

4272
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:54.740
and I'm going to start fashioning

4273
03:19:57.100 --> 03:19:58.600
a version of the symbol,

4274
03:19:58.600 --> 03:20:01.175
because everybody's got a little shrine,

4275
03:20:02.740 --> 03:20:04.970
upstairs, I want to start fashioning

4276
03:20:04.970 --> 03:20:06.930
my version of the Stormlord symbol

4277
03:20:08.020 --> 03:20:09.090
out of wood.

4278
03:20:10.270 --> 03:20:11.150
MATT: Okay.

4279
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.983
TALIESIN: Just a small one.

4280
03:20:11.983 --> 03:20:14.610
While I sit up there and get some light going

4281
03:20:14.610 --> 03:20:17.850
and go ahead and sit down, just do that for a bit.

4282
03:20:17.850 --> 03:20:20.210
MATT: It's serene as you built it.

4283
03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:22.120
This brief little beat of respite

4284
03:20:22.120 --> 03:20:24.770
from the intensity of the past week.

4285
03:20:25.630 --> 03:20:27.930
Or more.

4286
03:20:27.930 --> 03:20:30.180
You guys all eventually find your way up there,

4287
03:20:30.180 --> 03:20:33.210
you see Caduceus there, setting the light and begins--

4288
03:20:33.210 --> 03:20:36.360
MARISHA: Yeah, I de-armor, I put on some sweatpants.

4289
03:20:36.360 --> 03:20:37.193
MATT: There you go.

4290
03:20:37.193 --> 03:20:38.026
MARISHA: You know.

4291
03:20:38.026 --> 03:20:39.255
MATT: It's easy for you, you don't wear armor.

4292
03:20:39.255 --> 03:20:40.471
MARISHA: Wash my face.
MATT: So it's (snaps).

4293
03:20:40.471 --> 03:20:43.554
MARISHA: Yeah, just dump all my shit.

4294
03:20:48.621 --> 03:20:50.450
MATT: The tea comes quickly.

4295
03:20:50.450 --> 03:20:52.150
Doesn't take too long to get done.

4296
03:20:52.150 --> 03:20:53.610
Yeza maybe in the process of already

4297
03:20:53.610 --> 03:20:55.430
heating some for himself,

4298
03:20:55.430 --> 03:20:58.560
but eventually, Nott and Yeza come up to join you all

4299
03:20:58.560 --> 03:21:03.560
in the garden up in the tower region of the house.

4300
03:21:03.760 --> 03:21:07.610
A little platter and begins pouring tea for everyone.

4301
03:21:07.610 --> 03:21:10.940
SAM: So Yeza, some good news.

4302
03:21:10.940 --> 03:21:11.773
MATT: "Oh, all right, yeah."

4303
03:21:11.773 --> 03:21:14.031
SAM: I've arranged for Luc to be transported

4304
03:21:14.031 --> 03:21:15.464
to a safe place.

4305
03:21:15.464 --> 03:21:17.440
MATT: "Oh, wonderful, whereabouts?"

4306
03:21:17.440 --> 03:21:18.510
SAM: Nicodranas?

4307
03:21:18.510 --> 03:21:19.490
It's on the coast.

4308
03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:20.860
MATT: "Oh wow."
LAURA: It's really beautiful.

4309
03:21:20.860 --> 03:21:24.620
SAM: And we have a way to get us there as well.

4310
03:21:24.620 --> 03:21:25.453
MATT: "Oh, really?"

4311
03:21:25.453 --> 03:21:26.286
SAM: Yeah!

4312
03:21:26.286 --> 03:21:27.119
MATT: "I've always wanted to go,

4313
03:21:27.119 --> 03:21:28.593
"I've heard so many great things about it."

4314
03:21:28.593 --> 03:21:30.440
SAM: Well, yeah, I mean, you don't know how to swim.

4315
03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:31.316
MATT: "No."

4316
03:21:31.316 --> 03:21:32.650
SAM: So just be careful out there.

4317
03:21:32.650 --> 03:21:34.820
LAURA: There's people there that can teach you.

4318
03:21:34.820 --> 03:21:35.960
MATT: "Is it on the water?"

4319
03:21:35.960 --> 03:21:38.150
SAM: Stay away from the water, it's fine.

4320
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:39.500
The breeze is nice, the water--

4321
03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:40.950
MATT: "Okay."
SAM: The air is nice.

4322
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:42.340
TRAVIS: It's actually bath temperature,

4323
03:21:42.340 --> 03:21:44.040
it's actually fairly nice coastal climate.

4324
03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:46.580
SAM: It's pretty dangerous, the tides can come in quickly

4325
03:21:46.580 --> 03:21:47.770
and there's riptides too.

4326
03:21:47.770 --> 03:21:48.603
MATT: "Yeah.

4327
03:21:48.603 --> 03:21:50.630
"I'll just stay in the city."

4328
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:52.230
SAM: Yeah, that's good.

4329
03:21:52.230 --> 03:21:57.110
But we might even be able, unless you like it here,

4330
03:21:57.110 --> 03:22:00.310
we could just leave as early as tomorrow.

4331
03:22:00.310 --> 03:22:01.143
MATT: "Sure!

4332
03:22:01.143 --> 03:22:04.840
"I've been packed and ready to go since we got here.

4333
03:22:04.840 --> 03:22:06.440
"So any time, please!"

4334
03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:07.273
SAM: Okay, great!

4335
03:22:07.273 --> 03:22:09.330
Well, we'll do that tomorrow, then.

4336
03:22:09.330 --> 03:22:10.790
MATT: "All right."

4337
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:15.520
MARISHA: You know we left our, left our boat with Orly.

4338
03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:16.500
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

4339
03:22:16.500 --> 03:22:17.333
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4340
03:22:17.333 --> 03:22:20.650
MARISHA: Maybe Yeza can have that as a little project.

4341
03:22:20.650 --> 03:22:21.680
LAURA: Well, it's Orly.

4342
03:22:21.680 --> 03:22:22.830
MARISHA: To check in on.

4343
03:22:22.830 --> 03:22:24.840
LAURA: Yeah, maybe Yeza can hang out on the boat.

4344
03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:27.090
MARISHA: Yeah, he's just done such, you know,

4345
03:22:27.090 --> 03:22:30.720
marvelous things with this place.

4346
03:22:30.720 --> 03:22:32.900
MATT: "I've never really been on a boat before."

4347
03:22:32.900 --> 03:22:34.750
LAURA: Only if you want to, otherwise you can stay,

4348
03:22:34.750 --> 03:22:35.880
you know, with my mom.

4349
03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:37.340
SAM: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

4350
03:22:37.340 --> 03:22:39.730
Or with our son, you know, just whatever.

4351
03:22:39.730 --> 03:22:40.563
LAURA: Yeah, to my mom.

4352
03:22:40.563 --> 03:22:42.280
SAM: Yeah, your mom's house.

4353
03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:43.820
MARISHA: It's a pirate ship.

4354
03:22:43.820 --> 03:22:45.170
SAM: Yeah, but he's, I mean...

4355
03:22:47.350 --> 03:22:48.780
MATT: Both of you make persuasion checks.

4356
03:22:48.780 --> 03:22:51.680
(laughter)

4357
03:22:51.680 --> 03:22:52.980
Beauregard with disadvantage.

4358
03:22:52.980 --> 03:22:55.680
MARISHA: With disad-- oh, jeez.

4359
03:22:55.680 --> 03:22:57.110
TALIESIN: What could be worse?

4360
03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:59.170
SAM: 16.

4361
03:22:59.170 --> 03:23:00.390
MARISHA: Persuasion?
MATT: Yes.

4362
03:23:00.390 --> 03:23:02.151
SAM: Are you talking to her or me?

4363
03:23:02.151 --> 03:23:02.984
MARISHA: I haven't done this very often.

4364
03:23:02.984 --> 03:23:05.371
SAM: 16.
MARISHA: Seven.

4365
03:23:05.371 --> 03:23:06.704
TALIESIN: How do you even look at your notes?

4366
03:23:06.704 --> 03:23:09.160
Why do I ever look at your notes, Jesus.

4367
03:23:09.160 --> 03:23:12.200
MATT: "Maybe one day we'll happily check out a pirate ship.

4368
03:23:12.200 --> 03:23:13.943
"For now, I think probably we're going to

4369
03:23:13.943 --> 03:23:16.933
"stay back."

4370
03:23:16.933 --> 03:23:19.480
SAM: Small child, he might not like it or--

4371
03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:21.330
MARISHA: Just presenting, you know, the option.

4372
03:23:21.330 --> 03:23:22.163
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Because it's there.

4373
03:23:22.163 --> 03:23:23.210
SAM: Thank you.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4374
03:23:24.980 --> 03:23:28.083
SAM: Jester's very well connected, I could set you up with

4375
03:23:28.083 --> 03:23:29.844
some chemical supplies.

4376
03:23:29.844 --> 03:23:31.140
LAURA: You can have whatever you need.

4377
03:23:31.140 --> 03:23:32.594
MATT: "Okay, wow, yeah."

4378
03:23:32.594 --> 03:23:36.443
"Thank you, I appreciate that, that's sweet.

4379
03:23:36.443 --> 03:23:39.630
"Okay, well, can I get anybody anything else?"

4380
03:23:39.630 --> 03:23:40.463
LAURA: Nope!

4381
03:23:40.463 --> 03:23:42.480
TALIESIN: Is Caleb back yet?

4382
03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:44.130
MATT: Well, while you're asking that question.

4383
03:23:44.130 --> 03:23:44.963
So Caleb...

4384
03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:51.040
You don't really know where to find Essek

4385
03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:54.100
beyond the Lucid Bastion

4386
03:23:54.100 --> 03:23:56.590
in which he was in the chambers earlier.

4387
03:23:56.590 --> 03:23:58.670
It's been a couple hours, are you trying to head back

4388
03:23:58.670 --> 03:24:00.233
to the Lucid Bastion to retrieve him?

4389
03:24:00.233 --> 03:24:03.360
LIAM: Yeah, I would head back to where we had

4390
03:24:03.360 --> 03:24:06.026
our audience with the Queen, knowing that it's foolish.

4391
03:24:06.026 --> 03:24:08.234
I'm not going to get a hold of her.

4392
03:24:08.234 --> 03:24:11.830
Start asking and inquiring to him.

4393
03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:13.040
MATT: All right.

4394
03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:16.650
You're definitely held from entering the Lucid Bastion.

4395
03:24:16.650 --> 03:24:19.510
The guards there are saying that you know,

4396
03:24:19.510 --> 03:24:20.623
you have had one audience

4397
03:24:20.623 --> 03:24:22.640
and that is what you've been granted.

4398
03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:24.430
Upon asking for Essek,

4399
03:24:24.430 --> 03:24:26.840
you're asked to wait for about 30 or so minutes

4400
03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:29.920
and then he emerges, looking about

4401
03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:32.250
and turns to you with a smile.

4402
03:24:32.250 --> 03:24:33.380
"Hello.

4403
03:24:33.380 --> 03:24:34.880
"I heard you're looking for me."

4404
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:37.440
LIAM: That is correct.

4405
03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:39.530
Do you have a moment for me?

4406
03:24:39.530 --> 03:24:41.070
MATT: "A moment I can spare, yes.

4407
03:24:41.070 --> 03:24:43.262
"What do you require?"

4408
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:47.120
LIAM: I'm embarrassed but...

4409
03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:51.090
I have just come from your prisons.

4410
03:24:51.090 --> 03:24:53.700
The queen granted us the ability to visit

4411
03:24:53.700 --> 03:24:56.030
the Scourger that you have there.

4412
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:58.005
MATT: "Right, I remember seeing you request this

4413
03:24:58.005 --> 03:25:00.480
"not long ago."

4414
03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:03.850
LIAM: They are marked to die, correct?

4415
03:25:03.850 --> 03:25:06.630
MATT: I'm sorry, what was that?

4416
03:25:06.630 --> 03:25:09.280
LIAM: Execution, I heard execution mentioned.

4417
03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:12.055
MATT: "Right, they are to be executed, yes."

4418
03:25:12.055 --> 03:25:15.870
LIAM: Is there a timetable on that?

4419
03:25:15.870 --> 03:25:17.320
MATT: "Not entirely certain,

4420
03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:19.590
"I think they're to continue interrogation

4421
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:22.350
"for at least a few more days before they

4422
03:25:22.350 --> 03:25:26.000
"deem them of no further interest.

4423
03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:28.795
"So..."

4424
03:25:28.795 --> 03:25:33.795
LIAM: I'm just hoping you could stick to that timeline.

4425
03:25:34.268 --> 03:25:37.010
I know it's a foolish request, but

4426
03:25:37.010 --> 03:25:40.537
you have some idea of my past, yeah?

4427
03:25:41.396 --> 03:25:44.592
MATT: "Um, a fraction, maybe."

4428
03:25:46.130 --> 03:25:50.937
LIAM: I once was on a path to,

4429
03:25:50.937 --> 03:25:53.530
to be one of these,

4430
03:25:53.530 --> 03:25:56.590
and I thought there was a chance--

4431
03:25:56.590 --> 03:26:00.100
MATT: "Interesting"
LIAM: That I might have known this one.

4432
03:26:00.100 --> 03:26:03.210
MATT: "Are you telling me you were a Scourger?"

4433
03:26:03.210 --> 03:26:05.700
LIAM: No, no.

4434
03:26:05.700 --> 03:26:08.239
No.

4435
03:26:08.239 --> 03:26:10.830
I know about them a little bit.

4436
03:26:10.830 --> 03:26:13.310
MATT: "Right, right."

4437
03:26:13.310 --> 03:26:16.460
LIAM: I thought that this one, while the chances were slim,

4438
03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:18.740
I thought this one might be a person

4439
03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:23.297
that I came up with, in the Empire.

4440
03:26:23.297 --> 03:26:26.490
Or knew something about, and perhaps they could be useful

4441
03:26:26.490 --> 03:26:30.729
for my dealings with your queen, and I was incorrect.

4442
03:26:30.729 --> 03:26:33.212
It caught me off-guard.

4443
03:26:33.212 --> 03:26:36.913
Frankly, it would've caught me off-guard if it was the--

4444
03:26:36.913 --> 03:26:39.430
the individual I thought it was possibly.

4445
03:26:39.430 --> 03:26:40.700
MATT: "Well--"

4446
03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:42.280
LIAM: I would like to see to them further

4447
03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:45.000
but I have an errand to run,

4448
03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.230
and I just don't want to miss my window

4449
03:26:47.230 --> 03:26:48.990
and I have to get my thoughts in order

4450
03:26:48.990 --> 03:26:51.810
and sometimes I'm like this, I like to have order,

4451
03:26:51.810 --> 03:26:54.662
and don't we all.

4452
03:26:55.760 --> 03:26:58.118
MATT: "So are you requesting,

4453
03:26:58.118 --> 03:27:01.720
"requesting that we not accelerate this timetable,

4454
03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:03.500
"if I'm to understand?"

4455
03:27:03.500 --> 03:27:05.420
LIAM: Yes, I thought it might be

4456
03:27:05.420 --> 03:27:07.740
as early as this evening or tomorrow morning

4457
03:27:07.740 --> 03:27:11.790
but it sounds like I have a few days.

4458
03:27:11.790 --> 03:27:14.323
MATT: "I'll see what I can do."

4459
03:27:14.323 --> 03:27:17.853
LIAM: I would very much like to speak with this person

4460
03:27:17.853 --> 03:27:19.520
again, even in your presence,

4461
03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:23.598
if that makes it more conducive.

4462
03:27:25.010 --> 03:27:28.407
MATT: "I'll see what I can do."

4463
03:27:29.410 --> 03:27:31.120
LIAM: Thanks and I don't want to push my luck,

4464
03:27:31.120 --> 03:27:33.362
I appreciate your help.

4465
03:27:33.362 --> 03:27:34.970
MATT: "Of course.

4466
03:27:34.970 --> 03:27:37.330
"I have to get back to business, if you don't mind."

4467
03:27:37.330 --> 03:27:39.360
LIAM: Certainly.

4468
03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:41.110
And thank you.

4469
03:27:41.110 --> 03:27:43.550
MATT: "Light be with you."

4470
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:47.220
Essek turns around and enters the Lucid Bastion,

4471
03:27:47.220 --> 03:27:48.490
leaving you there solitary,

4472
03:27:48.490 --> 03:27:51.848
still standing in the exterior courtyard.

4473
03:27:54.300 --> 03:27:57.915
LIAM: (repeated) What are you doing?

4474
03:27:57.915 --> 03:28:00.615
You've got to keep the group together.

4475
03:28:00.615 --> 03:28:02.924
Focus on the group.

4476
03:28:02.924 --> 03:28:05.340
Focus on the group.

4477
03:28:07.472 --> 03:28:11.792
I'm just start walking in random directions

4478
03:28:11.792 --> 03:28:14.480
for a minute and then realize I'm an asshole

4479
03:28:14.480 --> 03:28:16.520
and start walking towards Xhorhaus.

4480
03:28:16.520 --> 03:28:18.353
MATT: Okay.

4481
03:28:18.353 --> 03:28:19.810
While you guys have been up there having tea,

4482
03:28:19.810 --> 03:28:23.240
Yeza's gone off to make some simple--

4483
03:28:23.240 --> 03:28:25.490
he's not the greatest chef, but, you know,

4484
03:28:25.490 --> 03:28:30.403
He can make basic, passible meal elements.

4485
03:28:32.991 --> 03:28:34.371
Is there anything you guys want to do?

4486
03:28:34.371 --> 03:28:35.390
Or are you just waiting for Caleb to return?

4487
03:28:35.390 --> 03:28:38.498
LAURA: I'm going to wander away

4488
03:28:38.498 --> 03:28:42.160
and go to Yasha's room.

4489
03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:44.507
MATT: Hmm.

4490
03:28:44.507 --> 03:28:45.340
You return to it.

4491
03:28:45.340 --> 03:28:48.310
The beautiful painting of the flower field

4492
03:28:48.310 --> 03:28:52.685
that you had painted for her there remains,

4493
03:28:52.685 --> 03:28:54.083
cold and quiet.

4494
03:28:54.083 --> 03:28:56.080
LAURA: I shut the door behind me.

4495
03:28:56.080 --> 03:28:58.847
I'm going to go over to the wall and

4496
03:28:58.847 --> 03:29:01.433
(sighs)

4497
03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:06.042
just put my hand on the mural,

4498
03:29:06.042 --> 03:29:09.373
and I'm going to say:

4499
03:29:10.730 --> 03:29:13.472
The Traveler told me to have faith.

4500
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:19.012
I know that this is who you are.

4501
03:29:20.590 --> 03:29:24.048
I'm going to have faith in you, Yasha.

4502
03:29:26.570 --> 03:29:31.570
I hope that the Stormlord can bring you home

4503
03:29:32.560 --> 03:29:35.835
and back to who you really want to be.

4504
03:29:39.320 --> 03:29:40.230
That's all.

4505
03:29:40.230 --> 03:29:41.670
And I'll leave the room.

4506
03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:43.486
MATT: Okay.

4507
03:29:50.910 --> 03:29:52.380
TALIESIN: Yesterday, I,

4508
03:29:52.380 --> 03:29:55.130
I'm going to pull out the sword and put it in front of me.

4509
03:29:56.510 --> 03:30:01.037
Yesterday I begged the question of what this sword is

4510
03:30:02.640 --> 03:30:07.370
and was told that it was a great weapon of elven descent.

4511
03:30:07.370 --> 03:30:11.366
You have the notes, hidden underneath the dicks.

4512
03:30:11.366 --> 03:30:12.587
LAURA: Oh, sorry.

4513
03:30:12.587 --> 03:30:14.500
(laughter)

4514
03:30:14.500 --> 03:30:16.370
MATT: Say the notes are always hidden.

4515
03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:17.864
TALIESIN: Yeah, the Dwueth'var.

4516
03:30:17.864 --> 03:30:19.470
LAURA: It's Dwueth'var.

4517
03:30:19.470 --> 03:30:21.320
TALIESIN: Dwueth'var, yeah, it's,

4518
03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:25.320
I think this is a weapon that we can use.

4519
03:30:25.320 --> 03:30:26.990
I think we can take it to,

4520
03:30:28.500 --> 03:30:30.960
to the Burning Lodge, to the kiln.

4521
03:30:30.960 --> 03:30:34.104
I think that perhaps they can reforge it.

4522
03:30:34.104 --> 03:30:36.950
MARISHA: Do you think there are people living in this kiln?

4523
03:30:38.384 --> 03:30:41.210
TALIESIN: Have I never explained?

4524
03:30:41.210 --> 03:30:44.670
LAURA: No, I just pictured a kiln all by itself.

4525
03:30:44.670 --> 03:30:46.950
MARISHA: Well, it's a mountain.
LAURA: Like you would use it.

4526
03:30:46.950 --> 03:30:47.783
maybe.

4527
03:30:49.040 --> 03:30:52.325
MARISHA: I know it's like a volcano, we can assume.

4528
03:30:52.325 --> 03:30:54.260
TALIESIN: I've never been.

4529
03:30:54.260 --> 03:30:56.271
LAURA: Well, then how do you know if people live there?

4530
03:30:56.271 --> 03:30:58.437
TALIESIN: Well...

4531
03:31:00.864 --> 03:31:02.090
This is as good a time as any.

4532
03:31:02.090 --> 03:31:04.940
I'm going to continue whittling.

4533
03:31:06.330 --> 03:31:09.690
The day after the Raven Queen ascended,

4534
03:31:09.690 --> 03:31:14.677
three of her champions were given the task

4535
03:31:16.020 --> 03:31:20.975
of dealing with one of the heroes of the war,

4536
03:31:22.320 --> 03:31:26.180
and his body could not be maintained within a city

4537
03:31:26.180 --> 03:31:28.290
for reasons that are lost.

4538
03:31:28.290 --> 03:31:31.210
He had to be vanished.

4539
03:31:31.210 --> 03:31:35.201
These three heroes were named

4540
03:31:35.201 --> 03:31:38.234
Clay, Stone, and Dust.

4541
03:31:39.740 --> 03:31:44.070
They argued for many days what to do

4542
03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:46.670
and Stone said that they should give him to the air

4543
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:51.070
so the beasts of the realm may carry his memory.

4544
03:31:51.070 --> 03:31:54.420
Clay said that we should give him to the earth,

4545
03:31:54.420 --> 03:31:59.190
and what grows from them will be a monument to his glory.

4546
03:31:59.190 --> 03:32:03.190
Dust said that we should give him to the fire.

4547
03:32:03.190 --> 03:32:08.182
From the ashes of that fire, great works would arise.

4548
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:11.680
They prayed to the Raven Queen

4549
03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:15.190
for guidance in these early days.

4550
03:32:15.190 --> 03:32:18.120
The Raven Queen eventually answered.

4551
03:32:18.120 --> 03:32:21.911
She said that she had already taken what belonged to her,

4552
03:32:21.911 --> 03:32:25.520
and that we were to,

4553
03:32:25.520 --> 03:32:28.461
these three heroes were to find the Wildmother

4554
03:32:28.461 --> 03:32:33.461
and ask her guidance for what to do with what was left.

4555
03:32:33.540 --> 03:32:36.250
They traveled far into the woods

4556
03:32:36.250 --> 03:32:38.767
and waited for their visions,

4557
03:32:38.767 --> 03:32:42.930
and eventually, she spoke to each of them in turn,

4558
03:32:42.930 --> 03:32:45.150
and she told Stone that he should

4559
03:32:45.150 --> 03:32:47.360
take the limbs of this hero

4560
03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:51.584
and walk the planes until he found an oasis

4561
03:32:51.584 --> 03:32:53.370
and a red and gold-veined cave

4562
03:32:53.370 --> 03:32:57.015
and that beasts would gather there,

4563
03:32:57.015 --> 03:32:58.870
that he would feed the limbs of these heroes

4564
03:32:58.870 --> 03:33:02.140
to the beasts that would water there,

4565
03:33:02.140 --> 03:33:06.030
and upon that site would be a menagerie with creatures

4566
03:33:06.030 --> 03:33:08.530
that would be a gift to the Changebringer

4567
03:33:08.530 --> 03:33:13.530
from the Wildmother, to remind her that nature is infinite.

4568
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:18.550
Then, Clay entered into a forest until he found a spring

4569
03:33:18.995 --> 03:33:22.640
of water surrounded by a circle of crystalline stone.

4570
03:33:22.640 --> 03:33:25.950
There she put the head of the hero.

4571
03:33:25.950 --> 03:33:28.290
Upon that site will be a garden

4572
03:33:28.290 --> 03:33:31.040
whose flora shall be my gift to the Archeart

4573
03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:34.498
to remind her that nature is beautiful.

4574
03:33:34.498 --> 03:33:38.770
Then Dust took all that was left

4575
03:33:38.770 --> 03:33:41.500
and walked into the mountains to the north.

4576
03:33:41.500 --> 03:33:45.291
Found a cave with a black onyx pool

4577
03:33:45.291 --> 03:33:48.082
of fire and magma,

4578
03:33:48.082 --> 03:33:50.650
was told to burn what remained,

4579
03:33:50.650 --> 03:33:52.510
that the ashes would be mixed

4580
03:33:52.510 --> 03:33:54.590
into the brick and ink and steel

4581
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:58.360
and everything that is made there

4582
03:33:58.360 --> 03:34:00.970
will hold that hero's mark

4583
03:34:00.970 --> 03:34:04.080
and this kiln will be the creations

4584
03:34:04.080 --> 03:34:05.870
as a gift to the Allhammer to remind him

4585
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:10.730
that nature is the origin of material.

4586
03:34:10.730 --> 03:34:15.717
These three families have guarded

4587
03:34:17.210 --> 03:34:20.980
and accepted the dead for all this time

4588
03:34:20.980 --> 03:34:25.980
in these three temples.

4589
03:34:26.740 --> 03:34:28.820
Each of us, on occasion,

4590
03:34:28.820 --> 03:34:31.487
making a pilgrimage, but very rarely.

4591
03:34:33.630 --> 03:34:38.615
Somewhere there is a member of the Dust in the north,

4592
03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:42.400
ready to help.

4593
03:34:42.400 --> 03:34:43.691
LAURA: Whoa.

4594
03:34:44.970 --> 03:34:47.280
You're ancient.

4595
03:34:47.280 --> 03:34:49.390
TALIESIN: No, no, I mean--

4596
03:34:49.390 --> 03:34:51.428
LAURA: Your blood is ancient!

4597
03:34:52.745 --> 03:34:54.170
TALIESIN: It was a while ago.

4598
03:34:54.170 --> 03:34:56.350
There's some things that are much older.

4599
03:34:56.350 --> 03:34:58.025
SAM: How old are you?

4600
03:34:59.590 --> 03:35:00.600
TALIESIN: Old enough.

4601
03:35:00.600 --> 03:35:01.840
SAM: What's that mean?

4602
03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:03.940
TALIESIN: I mean--
SAM: Say a number!

4603
03:35:03.940 --> 03:35:05.940
TALIESIN: I'm 2000 years old.

4604
03:35:05.940 --> 03:35:07.380
SAM: Are you shitting me right now?

4605
03:35:07.380 --> 03:35:08.308
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4606
03:35:08.308 --> 03:35:11.035
SAM: Ah, fuck you!
(laughter)

4607
03:35:11.035 --> 03:35:12.140
TALIESIN: I don't remember any of this,

4608
03:35:12.140 --> 03:35:14.840
this is just the stories that we were told.

4609
03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:15.673
LAURA: Wow.

4610
03:35:15.673 --> 03:35:17.133
TRAVIS: Your last name is Clay.

4611
03:35:17.133 --> 03:35:19.866
TALIESIN: Yeah, of the Clays.

4612
03:35:19.866 --> 03:35:21.550
LAURA: That's really cool.

4613
03:35:21.550 --> 03:35:25.230
TALIESIN: We have maintained that temple since,

4614
03:35:25.230 --> 03:35:27.760
since the Raven Queen ascended

4615
03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:29.250
in the name of the Wildmother.

4616
03:35:29.250 --> 03:35:31.390
LAURA: I just have one question.

4617
03:35:31.390 --> 03:35:34.770
Who the fuck is the Raven Queen?

4618
03:35:35.980 --> 03:35:39.210
TALIESIN: Matron of Ravens, she who walks the dead to the...

4619
03:35:40.220 --> 03:35:43.400
Does no one learn their--? Well, that's,

4620
03:35:43.400 --> 03:35:45.250
there are many gods.

4621
03:35:45.250 --> 03:35:46.340
LAURA: Oh, okay, she's one of the gods.

4622
03:35:46.340 --> 03:35:47.350
TALIESIN: She is one of the gods.

4623
03:35:47.350 --> 03:35:50.090
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4624
03:35:50.090 --> 03:35:52.155
TALIESIN: Much as the Stormlord is one of the gods.

4625
03:35:52.155 --> 03:35:53.380
LAURA: Oh, okay okay.

4626
03:35:53.380 --> 03:35:56.972
TRAVIS: Allhammer and the, yeah.

4627
03:35:56.972 --> 03:35:58.105
TALIESIN: There are many gods.

4628
03:35:58.105 --> 03:35:59.830
LAURA: I don't know a lot about gods.

4629
03:35:59.830 --> 03:36:01.590
MARISHA: The Knowing Mistress.

4630
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:02.860
SAM: So you think this--

4631
03:36:02.860 --> 03:36:04.610
LAURA: Who's the Knowing Mistress?

4632
03:36:04.610 --> 03:36:05.790
MARISHA: Another god.

4633
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:07.382
LAURA: Whoa.

4634
03:36:07.382 --> 03:36:08.215
MARISHA: I learned a lot about gods.

4635
03:36:08.215 --> 03:36:11.300
TALIESIN: You can see her stone is there.

4636
03:36:11.300 --> 03:36:15.730
I've built you a small stone of the Knowing Mistress.

4637
03:36:15.730 --> 03:36:17.210
MARISHA: Thanks, Clay.

4638
03:36:17.210 --> 03:36:18.043
TALIESIN: Everyone--

4639
03:36:18.043 --> 03:36:19.700
MARISHA: Caduceus, wow, that happened fast.

4640
03:36:19.700 --> 03:36:20.880
TALIESIN: Yep.

4641
03:36:20.880 --> 03:36:22.570
MARISHA: Clay's in my brain.

4642
03:36:22.570 --> 03:36:25.030
SAM: So there's a Dust person in the kiln?

4643
03:36:25.030 --> 03:36:27.070
TALIESIN: I would hope that many members of the Dust

4644
03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:27.903
are still there.

4645
03:36:27.903 --> 03:36:30.410
SAM: They can help us make this weapon?

4646
03:36:30.410 --> 03:36:31.790
TALIESIN: Maybe, I don't know.

4647
03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:35.890
MARISHA: There's the skull of a hero of the Raven Queen?

4648
03:36:35.890 --> 03:36:38.686
MARISHA: In your temple?
TALIESIN: No, I mean...

4649
03:36:38.686 --> 03:36:40.120
MARISHA: In the graveyard?

4650
03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:42.650
TALIESIN: This hero's long gone, I mean it's just,

4651
03:36:42.650 --> 03:36:43.680
this is just the story,

4652
03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:46.040
I mean, the head came with us is what they say,

4653
03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:48.760
although it's already gone.

4654
03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:51.424
It's just another flower in the garden.

4655
03:36:51.424 --> 03:36:54.730
LAURA: Wow.

4656
03:36:54.730 --> 03:36:59.110
TALIESIN: But we have one more god on our side.

4657
03:36:59.110 --> 03:37:01.550
I have a little wooden storm

4658
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:05.090
and lightning bolt wooden thing.

4659
03:37:05.090 --> 03:37:08.120
I pull out my spirals

4660
03:37:08.120 --> 03:37:11.120
and put the lightning bolt in one of the ears.

4661
03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:12.660
LAURA: Ooh, cool.

4662
03:37:12.660 --> 03:37:13.493
MARISHA: Dope.

4663
03:37:14.580 --> 03:37:16.480
TALIESIN: I think the Stormlord wants us to save her.

4664
03:37:16.480 --> 03:37:19.400
LAURA: We have the Stormlord, we got the Raven Queen here?

4665
03:37:19.400 --> 03:37:21.660
TALIESIN: Ah, Raven Queen is everywhere.

4666
03:37:21.660 --> 03:37:23.268
LAURA: But should we have a little thing for her

4667
03:37:23.268 --> 03:37:24.318
or something?

4668
03:37:24.318 --> 03:37:26.210
TALIESIN: She doesn't really need it, I don't think,

4669
03:37:26.210 --> 03:37:29.230
I don't think any of us really--

4670
03:37:29.230 --> 03:37:31.130
MARISHA: I'm good.

4671
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:32.220
LAURA: We got the Traveler here.

4672
03:37:32.220 --> 03:37:33.310
TALIESIN: I have the Traveler,

4673
03:37:33.310 --> 03:37:35.920
I have a little thing for you for that.

4674
03:37:35.920 --> 03:37:37.475
LAURA: Thank you.

4675
03:37:37.475 --> 03:37:39.180
TALIESIN: And I have a pool for you,

4676
03:37:39.180 --> 03:37:43.490
although I'm leaving it--

4677
03:37:43.490 --> 03:37:44.730
MARISHA: Wait, you built us a pool?

4678
03:37:44.730 --> 03:37:45.563
What do you mean, a pool?

4679
03:37:45.563 --> 03:37:47.260
LAURA: Well no, it's a jacuzzi down below.

4680
03:37:48.555 --> 03:37:49.388
SAM: Hot tub.

4681
03:37:49.388 --> 03:37:50.221
TALIESIN: There's just a little shrine

4682
03:37:50.221 --> 03:37:51.690
for whatever it is that you need.

4683
03:37:51.690 --> 03:37:53.270
MARISHA: The jacuzzi is a shrine?

4684
03:37:53.270 --> 03:37:54.552
TALIESIN: No.
MARISHA: For his shit?

4685
03:37:54.552 --> 03:37:55.502
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out a stone

4686
03:37:55.502 --> 03:37:56.952
that has a tiny little,

4687
03:37:56.952 --> 03:37:58.530
like a hole where water is.

4688
03:37:58.530 --> 03:38:00.010
MATT: Like a bird bath.

4689
03:38:00.010 --> 03:38:00.930
TALIESIN: A basin just big enough

4690
03:38:00.930 --> 03:38:03.775
to drown your face in, if you're in the mood.

4691
03:38:03.775 --> 03:38:06.222
TRAVIS: I might be.
TALIESIN: You might be.

4692
03:38:06.222 --> 03:38:08.430
TRAVIS: I just--

4693
03:38:08.430 --> 03:38:09.730
SAM: I've got this.

4694
03:38:09.730 --> 03:38:11.270
I'm good.

4695
03:38:11.270 --> 03:38:12.760
TALIESIN: There's a liquor cabinet downstairs.

4696
03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:13.593
SAM: That's me.

4697
03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:17.440
LAURA: Is there a god of alcohol?

4698
03:38:20.300 --> 03:38:22.260
TALIESIN: Guess maybe the Moonweaver?

4699
03:38:22.260 --> 03:38:25.777
MATT: There are a few different crossovers there.

4700
03:38:26.859 --> 03:38:29.040
TALIESIN: There are lots of gods,

4701
03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:34.040
and there's still a point for the Stormlord right there,

4702
03:38:34.560 --> 03:38:35.837
waiting for her.

4703
03:38:35.837 --> 03:38:36.670
LAURA: Good.

4704
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:40.640
You guys, I'm feeling really exhausted.

4705
03:38:41.530 --> 03:38:43.790
SAM: We traveled far today.

4706
03:38:43.790 --> 03:38:46.000
Met a queen.

4707
03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:50.100
Interrogated a crazy person, a Scourger.

4708
03:38:50.100 --> 03:38:50.933
LAURA: Yeah.

4709
03:38:50.933 --> 03:38:52.122
SAM: Let's hit the hay.

4710
03:38:53.155 --> 03:38:55.240
LAURA: Wake up in the morning and--

4711
03:38:55.240 --> 03:38:56.560
SAM: Go somewhere else.

4712
03:38:56.560 --> 03:38:57.393
LAURA: Yeah.

4713
03:38:57.393 --> 03:38:58.520
MARISHA: Oh, hey, Jester?

4714
03:38:58.520 --> 03:38:59.353
LAURA: Yeah?

4715
03:38:59.353 --> 03:39:01.130
MARISHA: Can you still send a message?

4716
03:39:01.130 --> 03:39:01.963
Is that doable?

4717
03:39:01.963 --> 03:39:03.910
LAURA: Let me-- yes I can.

4718
03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:10.231
Am I sending something to Dairon?

4719
03:39:10.231 --> 03:39:12.314
MARISHA: (groans)

4720
03:39:13.610 --> 03:39:18.263
LAURA: What should I say?

4721
03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:21.850
MARISHA: You're charming, just be like,

4722
03:39:21.850 --> 03:39:23.540
do the Jester thing, just be like,

4723
03:39:23.540 --> 03:39:25.698
(like Jester) Hey Dairon, just wanted to let you know,

4724
03:39:25.698 --> 03:39:27.082
we're here.
LAURA: You sound so much

4725
03:39:27.082 --> 03:39:28.197
like me, oh my gosh!

4726
03:39:28.197 --> 03:39:29.320
MARISHA: I've been around you so much.

4727
03:39:29.320 --> 03:39:30.340
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

4728
03:39:30.340 --> 03:39:35.340
MARISHA: I don't know, just be like, you know, Beau's fine.

4729
03:39:37.205 --> 03:39:38.140
Hit us up when you need us.

4730
03:39:38.140 --> 03:39:40.800
Bye, peace, but don't contact us if you don't need anything,

4731
03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:41.890
Kay, bye.

4732
03:39:41.890 --> 03:39:44.960
LAURA: Should I tell her where we live?

4733
03:39:44.960 --> 03:39:45.793
MARISHA: If she's smart enough,

4734
03:39:45.793 --> 03:39:46.720
she should be able to figure it out.

4735
03:39:46.720 --> 03:39:48.740
LAURA: That's true, we have a big tree on the top.

4736
03:39:48.740 --> 03:39:51.456
MARISHA: Yeah, a tree. That's pretty ostentatious.

4737
03:39:51.456 --> 03:39:53.020
LAURA: Yeah.

4738
03:39:53.020 --> 03:39:54.700
Going to send a message.

4739
03:39:54.700 --> 03:39:57.020
MATT: Okay, what are you sending?

4740
03:39:57.020 --> 03:40:00.107
LAURA: Hey Dairon, it's me, Jester.

4741
03:40:00.107 --> 03:40:01.930
I'm here with Beau.

4742
03:40:01.930 --> 03:40:06.930
She's sorry she hasn't hit you up, but--

4743
03:40:07.163 --> 03:40:09.563
MARISHA and LAURA: -- we're here!

4744
03:40:11.440 --> 03:40:13.320
MARISHA: In Rosohna.

4745
03:40:13.320 --> 03:40:16.560
LAURA: In Rosohna.

4746
03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:18.410
Bye!

4747
03:40:21.400 --> 03:40:24.400
MATT: About a minute passes with nothing.

4748
03:40:24.400 --> 03:40:25.900
MARISHA: Oh, maybe it's late, you know.

4749
03:40:25.900 --> 03:40:26.770
Maybe she's not going to answer.

4750
03:40:26.770 --> 03:40:29.150
LAURA: She's asleep or she's probably going to answer.

4751
03:40:29.150 --> 03:40:30.141
TALIESIN: -- really mess up the--

4752
03:40:30.141 --> 03:40:30.974
MARISHA: I mean, she's gone.

4753
03:40:30.974 --> 03:40:32.451
LAURA: She's probably going to answer.

4754
03:40:32.451 --> 03:40:35.500
MARISHA: Do you think she's going to answer?

4755
03:40:35.500 --> 03:40:37.027
MATT: "You said you are here."

4756
03:40:37.027 --> 03:40:37.860
MARISHA: Fuck.

4757
03:40:40.231 --> 03:40:43.707
MATT: "(sighs) It took long enough.

4758
03:40:49.378 --> 03:40:54.365
"If you could give me any inclination of where to find you.

4759
03:40:57.670 --> 03:41:00.812
"Things are difficult."

4760
03:41:03.081 --> 03:41:04.020
And that's it.

4761
03:41:04.020 --> 03:41:05.650
MARISHA: Fuck.

4762
03:41:05.650 --> 03:41:07.842
LAURA: Beau, she sounded like she really wanted to

4763
03:41:07.842 --> 03:41:10.730
talk to you and it's probably kind of dangerous

4764
03:41:10.730 --> 03:41:12.880
and she doesn't know where we are.

4765
03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:14.110
MARISHA: She can't...

4766
03:41:14.110 --> 03:41:15.490
She's supposed to be an investigator!

4767
03:41:15.490 --> 03:41:17.100
LAURA: Well, maybe she shows up

4768
03:41:17.100 --> 03:41:19.250
after we've already left, you know.

4769
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:20.475
Maybe we were up north

4770
03:41:20.475 --> 03:41:21.749
or something?
MARISHA: Did she sound okay?

4771
03:41:21.749 --> 03:41:23.990
LAURA: She sounded intense,
but I don't know if that's normal.

4772
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:25.520
MARISHA: She's kind of intense, kind of normal.

4773
03:41:25.520 --> 03:41:26.860
LAURA: Should I send another message

4774
03:41:26.860 --> 03:41:28.180
and tell her where to find us or--

4775
03:41:28.180 --> 03:41:29.734
MARISHA: Yeah, if you can.

4776
03:41:29.734 --> 03:41:32.003
LAURA: Or maybe you guys can wait until we leave tomorrow

4777
03:41:32.003 --> 03:41:34.094
and it will be like, oh my gosh, okay, I thought--

4778
03:41:34.094 --> 03:41:35.140
TALIESIN: We certainly can't be held accountable

4779
03:41:35.140 --> 03:41:37.360
for every person who comes up and rings our bell.

4780
03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:38.850
MARISHA: She's my mentor.

4781
03:41:38.850 --> 03:41:39.930
TALIESIN: Which is why I'm saying we should--

4782
03:41:39.930 --> 03:41:41.800
LAURA: I'm going to send another message.

4783
03:41:41.800 --> 03:41:43.566
MATT: Mm-hmm. So what are you saying?

4784
03:41:43.566 --> 03:41:45.850
MARISHA: Only if it's totally trouble, you know.

4785
03:41:45.850 --> 03:41:48.940
LAURA: We are at the Xhorhaus, obviously.

4786
03:41:48.940 --> 03:41:50.260
MARISHA: House with a big tree.

4787
03:41:50.260 --> 03:41:51.660
LAURA: There's a big tree on top.

4788
03:41:52.860 --> 03:41:54.050
MARISHA: It's got lights.

4789
03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:57.185
LAURA: We are super integrated.

4790
03:42:00.050 --> 03:42:03.530
Be sneaky if you come say hi.

4791
03:42:04.420 --> 03:42:07.624
Or we're going to leave tomorrow.

4792
03:42:07.624 --> 03:42:09.494
(laughter)

4793
03:42:09.494 --> 03:42:10.620
TRAVIS: We're going to leave.

4794
03:42:10.620 --> 03:42:11.453
TALIESIN: Wow.

4795
03:42:13.230 --> 03:42:16.383
Flashback to some bad relationships.

4796
03:42:18.888 --> 03:42:19.760
Come say hi, or we're leaving.

4797
03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:21.180
MATT: There is no response.

4798
03:42:21.180 --> 03:42:22.330
LAURA: No response, there's no response,

4799
03:42:22.330 --> 03:42:23.740
she didn't respond, oh my gosh.

4800
03:42:23.740 --> 03:42:24.573
MATT: Caleb--
LAURA: Probably just going to

4801
03:42:24.573 --> 03:42:26.472
show up.
MATT: Arrives at this point.

4802
03:42:26.472 --> 03:42:28.040
SAM: Or just was killed.

4803
03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:29.890
MARISHA: What, did you think she was in a situation

4804
03:42:29.890 --> 03:42:31.000
where maybe she was getting caught?

4805
03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:31.833
LAURA: I don't know,

4806
03:42:31.833 --> 03:42:35.526
maybe she's walking here right now, Beau.

4807
03:42:35.526 --> 03:42:37.610
LIAM: I'll seek out where everybody is in the house.

4808
03:42:37.610 --> 03:42:38.700
LAURA: Beau, Beau, Beau.

4809
03:42:38.700 --> 03:42:41.134
SAM: Hey, Cay.
MARISHA: What?

4810
03:42:41.134 --> 03:42:43.840
LIAM: Are we, do we need to figure anything else

4811
03:42:43.840 --> 03:42:46.690
tomorrow? Are you good, Nott, for tomorrow?

4812
03:42:46.690 --> 03:42:48.323
SAM: We're going to go to sleep and

4813
03:42:48.323 --> 03:42:50.780
travel some in the morning.

4814
03:42:50.780 --> 03:42:53.688
LIAM: You're good, you feel like this is a

4815
03:42:53.688 --> 03:42:57.450
positive direction for your husband, your child?

4816
03:42:57.450 --> 03:42:58.283
SAM: Yes.

4817
03:42:58.283 --> 03:43:00.580
MATT: Yeza, who is off on the side of the room right now,

4818
03:43:00.580 --> 03:43:03.030
with the little platter of

4819
03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:04.600
shitty cakes that he's made.

4820
03:43:04.600 --> 03:43:05.470
SAM: They're great cakes.

4821
03:43:05.470 --> 03:43:08.090
MATT: "A very, ah, thank you so much.

4822
03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:10.250
"I'm ready, I'm ready whenever."

4823
03:43:10.250 --> 03:43:12.500
SAM: Yeah, he does not want to be here anymore

4824
03:43:12.500 --> 03:43:15.020
and I don't blame him because this place is crawling

4825
03:43:15.020 --> 03:43:17.850
with monsters and bad guys.

4826
03:43:17.850 --> 03:43:20.783
LIAM: And you, Nott, are you--

4827
03:43:20.783 --> 03:43:24.450
SAM: Yeah, yeah, we'll deal with that tomorrow, yeah.

4828
03:43:24.450 --> 03:43:26.900
MARISHA: There's some leftover tea, Caleb.

4829
03:43:26.900 --> 03:43:28.650
LAURA: Yeah, go grab some.
MARISHA: I think, if you want.

4830
03:43:28.650 --> 03:43:29.483
MATT: "It's a little cold.

4831
03:43:29.483 --> 03:43:31.820
"I can heat it up for you, hold on."

4832
03:43:31.820 --> 03:43:34.810
LIAM: Iced tea is fine, do you have ice?

4833
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:37.463
MATT: "You're the wizard."

4834
03:43:37.463 --> 03:43:39.790
TALIESIN: I don't think we have ice.

4835
03:43:39.790 --> 03:43:40.970
LIAM: Not my specialty.

4836
03:43:40.970 --> 03:43:43.813
MATT: "I'll go heat it up for you."

4837
03:43:43.813 --> 03:43:44.646
MARISHA: Anyway, Jester and I

4838
03:43:44.646 --> 03:43:45.960
are going to start heading to our rooms.

4839
03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:47.530
LAURA: We're just going to go upstairs, okay.

4840
03:43:47.530 --> 03:43:48.660
Bye, you guys.

4841
03:43:48.660 --> 03:43:51.060
LIAM: Sleep, everyone needs to sleep because

4842
03:43:51.060 --> 03:43:53.540
we have a lot to do tomorrow, we need to be on the ball.

4843
03:43:53.540 --> 03:43:55.570
LAURA: Yep yep yep yep.

4844
03:43:55.570 --> 03:43:56.966
Beau.
MARISHA: What?

4845
03:43:56.966 --> 03:43:59.970
LAURA: Maybe you should sleep on the balcony or something,

4846
03:43:59.970 --> 03:44:01.507
so if she comes up--

4847
03:44:01.507 --> 03:44:02.340
MARISHA: What if she comes,

4848
03:44:02.340 --> 03:44:04.198
what if she brings trouble towards us?

4849
03:44:04.198 --> 03:44:06.070
TALIESIN: There's a bell on the door, guys.

4850
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:07.411
LAURA: Well, she's not going to probably use it,

4851
03:44:07.411 --> 03:44:09.860
she's super sneaky.
MARISHA: She's a spy!

4852
03:44:09.860 --> 03:44:11.986
Sorry, you're right.

4853
03:44:11.986 --> 03:44:12.819
LAURA: You want to sleep on the porch,

4854
03:44:12.819 --> 03:44:14.652
do you want me to sleep on the balcony maybe?

4855
03:44:14.652 --> 03:44:16.640
MARISHA: No, I don't want to--

4856
03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:18.000
That's not safe!

4857
03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.050
Maybe I could, oh.

4858
03:44:20.050 --> 03:44:21.750
TALIESIN: You know, a simple investment in a hammock

4859
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:24.840
could make all of this so much more pleasant.

4860
03:44:24.840 --> 03:44:26.420
Just put a hammock on the balcony.

4861
03:44:26.420 --> 03:44:28.199
LAURA: Why is Caduceus following us upstairs?

4862
03:44:28.199 --> 03:44:29.831
(laughter)

4863
03:44:29.831 --> 03:44:31.562
Caduceus, we're being sneaky!

4864
03:44:31.562 --> 03:44:32.395
TALIESIN: Are you being sneaky?

4865
03:44:32.395 --> 03:44:34.200
LAURA: Caduceus, stop talking so loud!

4866
03:44:34.200 --> 03:44:36.643
TALIESIN: Well, you're talking loud enough for me to hear.

4867
03:44:36.643 --> 03:44:37.701
TRAVIS: What'd you say, Caduceus?

4868
03:44:37.701 --> 03:44:39.060
TALIESIN: I said they're trying to be sneaky.

4869
03:44:39.060 --> 03:44:40.390
LAURA: Caduceus, come on!

4870
03:44:40.390 --> 03:44:41.860
MARISHA: We said we were very sleepy.

4871
03:44:41.860 --> 03:44:44.310
LIAM: Caduceus, Fjord and I want you down here.

4872
03:44:44.310 --> 03:44:45.840
We need to have a talk.

4873
03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:47.090
TALIESIN: All right.

4874
03:44:49.480 --> 03:44:52.240
MARISHA: There's no privacy in this house!

4875
03:44:52.240 --> 03:44:54.273
Stupid group.

4876
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:56.725
TALIESIN: Leave me alone!

4877
03:44:56.725 --> 03:44:59.500
(laughter)

4878
03:44:59.500 --> 03:45:02.480
MARISHA: Okay, okay, maybe just for a couple hours,

4879
03:45:02.480 --> 03:45:05.360
if she doesn't show up, we'll see.

4880
03:45:05.360 --> 03:45:06.280
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

4881
03:45:06.280 --> 03:45:08.280
MARISHA: I'll sleep down the front

4882
03:45:08.280 --> 03:45:10.250
so she doesn't ring the bell.

4883
03:45:10.250 --> 03:45:11.750
If you want to take the balcony.

4884
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:13.030
LAURA: Okay, I'll sleep on the balcony.

4885
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:15.110
MATT: Okay, where are you sleeping?

4886
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:16.160
MARISHA: On the front stoop.

4887
03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:17.340
MATT: Front stoop, you got it.

4888
03:45:17.340 --> 03:45:18.570
MARISHA: We're behind a wall, right?

4889
03:45:18.570 --> 03:45:19.950
We're gated?

4890
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:21.100
MATT: It's not a wall, no,

4891
03:45:21.100 --> 03:45:24.220
and there's maybe a small fence, but it's pretty open.

4892
03:45:24.220 --> 03:45:26.930
LAURA: If anybody comes up,

4893
03:45:26.930 --> 03:45:28.460
you know, we had a fight or something.

4894
03:45:28.460 --> 03:45:31.125
MARISHA: Yeah, and I just

4895
03:45:31.125 --> 03:45:32.420
passed out outside because--

4896
03:45:32.420 --> 03:45:33.253
LAURA: You're super drunk.

4897
03:45:33.253 --> 03:45:35.160
MARISHA: Yeah, and it was cooler.

4898
03:45:35.160 --> 03:45:35.993
You know, more air.

4899
03:45:35.993 --> 03:45:36.993
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah.
TRAVIS: Who's going to run recon?

4900
03:45:36.993 --> 03:45:38.509
She's not coming up.

4901
03:45:38.509 --> 03:45:41.460
LIAM: When, if Caduceus comes back down the steps,

4902
03:45:41.460 --> 03:45:44.380
Caleb is taking out his bottle of whiskey

4903
03:45:44.380 --> 03:45:47.740
and is finding three other glasses in this place.

4904
03:45:47.740 --> 03:45:49.600
Fjord, are there glasses in this place?

4905
03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:50.740
SAM: Yes, yes, we have glasses.

4906
03:45:50.740 --> 03:45:54.430
TALIESIN: There's still a ton upstairs with the tea.

4907
03:45:54.430 --> 03:45:55.263
Sure.

4908
03:45:55.263 --> 03:45:56.820
LIAM: Did you go up, Nott, I thought all the ladies left.

4909
03:45:56.820 --> 03:45:59.720
SAM: Oh, sorry, no, they left, I'm still here.

4910
03:45:59.720 --> 03:46:01.390
There's glasses, we're drinking tea.

4911
03:46:01.390 --> 03:46:02.223
Yes.

4912
03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:05.940
LIAM: I am not drinking tea, are you drinking tea?

4913
03:46:05.940 --> 03:46:07.550
SAM: Yes, my husband made tea.

4914
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:08.383
We're drinking tea.

4915
03:46:08.383 --> 03:46:11.010
MATT: He comes back out with the freshly steaming kettle.

4916
03:46:11.010 --> 03:46:13.440
"All right, we're ready to go!"

4917
03:46:13.440 --> 03:46:15.750
LIAM: All right, hold that, I really wanted some tea,

4918
03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:16.900
you know, just in time.

4919
03:46:16.900 --> 03:46:17.733
MATT: "Of course!"

4920
03:46:17.733 --> 03:46:19.540
Goes ahead and pulls a few glasses out

4921
03:46:19.540 --> 03:46:23.089
and fills them for everybody.

4922
03:46:23.089 --> 03:46:24.480
LIAM: I pour a shot of whiskey in my own

4923
03:46:24.480 --> 03:46:27.430
and put the bottle down in the middle of the table.

4924
03:46:30.320 --> 03:46:32.860
Just one drink, anyone who wants to join.

4925
03:46:34.160 --> 03:46:37.810
Boys, and Veth.

4926
03:46:37.810 --> 03:46:40.100
SAM: Do you want some boy time, that's fine,

4927
03:46:40.100 --> 03:46:42.930
me and Yeza can go downstairs and start cleaning up.

4928
03:46:42.930 --> 03:46:44.730
MATT: "Yeah, I've got all sorts of things

4929
03:46:44.730 --> 03:46:47.120
"to make sure I've triple-packed."

4930
03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:49.200
MARISHA: As I pass by the front, where he is.

4931
03:46:49.200 --> 03:46:52.610
LIAM: Yeza can stay if he wants to.

4932
03:46:52.610 --> 03:46:56.218
SAM: You want Yeza to stay and not me?

4933
03:46:56.218 --> 03:46:57.400
Why, I'm confused.

4934
03:46:57.400 --> 03:46:59.410
Do you want me to stay or not?

4935
03:46:59.410 --> 03:47:02.890
TALIESIN: I think everybody can stay who wants to stay.

4936
03:47:02.890 --> 03:47:05.073
SAM: Do you have something to say?
LIAM: I'm getting a drink,

4937
03:47:05.073 --> 03:47:08.064
I just need to settle my nerves before tomorrow

4938
03:47:08.064 --> 03:47:11.460
because we're jumping a very far distance

4939
03:47:11.460 --> 03:47:13.070
and I'm still getting the hang of this

4940
03:47:13.070 --> 03:47:15.890
and there's a lot going on.

4941
03:47:15.890 --> 03:47:16.910
SAM: Sure, sure.

4942
03:47:16.910 --> 03:47:20.170
LIAM: I just want everybody to be on the same page.

4943
03:47:20.170 --> 03:47:21.390
MARISHA: Caleb is being that guy.

4944
03:47:21.390 --> 03:47:22.930
You guys aren't leaving me, are you?

4945
03:47:22.930 --> 03:47:24.620
SAM: Yeah, if you all want us to drink--

4946
03:47:24.620 --> 03:47:26.280
LIAM: Sit with me while I have a drink.

4947
03:47:26.280 --> 03:47:28.670
SAM: Sure, sure, we'll all sit around you, drinking tea

4948
03:47:28.670 --> 03:47:30.220
while you get drunk, it's fine.

4949
03:47:30.220 --> 03:47:31.053
Go ahead.

4950
03:47:31.053 --> 03:47:32.050
LIAM: I'm not going to get drunk,

4951
03:47:32.050 --> 03:47:35.380
I'm going to have a shot and calm my nerves.

4952
03:47:36.220 --> 03:47:37.391
TALIESIN: Seems to be working.

4953
03:47:37.391 --> 03:47:39.841
(laughter)

4954
03:47:39.841 --> 03:47:41.999
LIAM: I haven't had a sip yet, Caduceus, I just--

4955
03:47:43.300 --> 03:47:46.710
Have you tried this yet or have you only had tea?

4956
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:50.050
You only drank tea, haven't you?

4957
03:47:50.050 --> 03:47:51.570
TALIESIN: I only drink tea.

4958
03:47:51.570 --> 03:47:53.311
LIAM: You only--

4959
03:47:53.311 --> 03:47:55.840
TALIESIN: Well, I drink other things, but

4960
03:47:55.840 --> 03:47:59.323
my brief experimentation with

4961
03:47:59.323 --> 03:48:02.614
spirits has not gone well.

4962
03:48:04.010 --> 03:48:05.520
LIAM: Well, I'm glad you're all here.

4963
03:48:05.520 --> 03:48:08.740
I'm glad the other two upstairs are here as well

4964
03:48:08.740 --> 03:48:13.340
but I'm glad you're here, yeah.

4965
03:48:13.340 --> 03:48:15.478
I stare at Fjord for a second.

4966
03:48:15.478 --> 03:48:17.270
Are you good?

4967
03:48:17.270 --> 03:48:18.990
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4968
03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:19.823
LIAM: Yeah.

4969
03:48:25.430 --> 03:48:26.422
SAM: Are you going to kill us all

4970
03:48:26.422 --> 03:48:28.012
in our sleep tonight?

4971
03:48:28.012 --> 03:48:30.410
(laughter)

4972
03:48:30.410 --> 03:48:31.990
Oh my gosh.

4973
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:33.365
LIAM: I guess maybe

4974
03:48:33.365 --> 03:48:35.360
trying to do a toast is out of character.

4975
03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:37.100
Yes, I'm going to kill all of you.

4976
03:48:37.100 --> 03:48:38.580
(laughter)

4977
03:48:38.580 --> 03:48:40.780
SAM: Well, I'll drink to that!

4978
03:48:43.400 --> 03:48:45.690
TALIESIN: To underdogs.

4979
03:48:45.690 --> 03:48:47.523
LAURA: To wonder dogs.

4980
03:48:48.470 --> 03:48:50.868
SAM: To Wonderbread!

4981
03:48:51.850 --> 03:48:53.239
LIAM: To <i>wunderbars</i>.

4982
03:48:53.239 --> 03:48:55.872
(laughter)

4983
03:48:55.872 --> 03:48:57.520
SAM: All right, let's go to sleep.

4984
03:48:57.520 --> 03:48:58.761
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

4985
03:49:00.279 --> 03:49:05.020
MATT: You guys finish your drinks, some tea, some tea plus,

4986
03:49:05.020 --> 03:49:08.110
heading to your respective chambers.

4987
03:49:08.110 --> 03:49:09.020
MARISHA: No.

4988
03:49:09.020 --> 03:49:10.890
MATT: Except for you, you're staying on the stoop, you said?

4989
03:49:10.890 --> 03:49:12.220
MARISHA: And keeping an eye out for Dairon.

4990
03:49:12.220 --> 03:49:13.850
LAURA: I'm sleeping on the balcony.

4991
03:49:13.850 --> 03:49:14.683
MATT: Okay.

4992
03:49:14.683 --> 03:49:18.558
MARISHA: I might occasionally peak around the back,

4993
03:49:18.558 --> 03:49:20.620
fervently looking for her.

4994
03:49:20.620 --> 03:49:22.030
TRAVIS: Are you up on the roof of the balcony

4995
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.950
or just your balcony?

4996
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:25.953
LAURA: Just the balcony, the one that's a shared balcony.

4997
03:49:25.953 --> 03:49:29.600
TRAVIS: I'll go, I want to be under the tree a little bit.

4998
03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:30.810
MATT: Okay.

4999
03:49:30.810 --> 03:49:33.150
You sit out in front of the tree.

5000
03:49:33.150 --> 03:49:35.420
LIAM: I'll stay for an hour writing in the other book

5001
03:49:35.420 --> 03:49:37.800
and I'll turn in.

5002
03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:38.633
MATT: You got it.

5003
03:49:38.633 --> 03:49:41.670
All right, as you all scatter to your respective positions

5004
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:43.620
for the evening's rest,

5005
03:49:44.760 --> 03:49:47.740
keeping watch, looking out,

5006
03:49:49.200 --> 03:49:52.492
Beau and Jester, make perception checks for me, please.

5007
03:49:52.492 --> 03:49:54.825
LAURA: (whistling)

5008
03:49:56.892 --> 03:49:59.580
Ooh!
MARISHA: Okay okay okay okay.

5009
03:49:59.580 --> 03:50:00.860
LAURA: 24.

5010
03:50:00.860 --> 03:50:01.693
MARISHA: 19.

5011
03:50:02.756 --> 03:50:03.589
MATT: 19.

5012
03:50:03.589 --> 03:50:06.830
MARISHA: I think that's a 16, 19.

5013
03:50:06.830 --> 03:50:09.590
MATT: You, from the balcony standpoint, glance off the side

5014
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:14.590
and you see a figure leap, and hands very quietly

5015
03:50:15.690 --> 03:50:17.620
touch the edge of the balcony railing.

5016
03:50:17.620 --> 03:50:20.120
MARISHA: She was going up the balcony.

5017
03:50:20.120 --> 03:50:21.420
LAURA: The balcony rail where I am?

5018
03:50:21.420 --> 03:50:22.640
MATT: Yeah.

5019
03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:24.110
Like five feet from you.

5020
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:25.050
LAURA: Ah, hi.

5021
03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:29.355
MATT: You see slowly,

5022
03:50:29.355 --> 03:50:33.022
a drow head rise up to look towards you.

5023
03:50:34.590 --> 03:50:39.465
You recognize it as the drow image of Dairon.

5024
03:50:39.465 --> 03:50:42.690
LAURA: That was so cool.

5025
03:50:42.690 --> 03:50:45.390
MATT: "Where is Beauregard?"

5026
03:50:45.390 --> 03:50:50.170
LAURA: Well, she's downstairs on the stoop,

5027
03:50:50.170 --> 03:50:54.218
literally right below you.

5028
03:50:54.218 --> 03:50:56.690
MATT: (whooshing) Leaps up, very silently does

5029
03:50:56.690 --> 03:50:58.350
a cartwheel flip over the side

5030
03:50:58.350 --> 03:51:00.770
before landing on the tips of her toes.

5031
03:51:00.770 --> 03:51:02.630
LAURA: You are so sneaky!

5032
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:04.590
MATT: "Shh."

5033
03:51:04.590 --> 03:51:06.520
LAURA: Come inside, have a nice cup of tea.

5034
03:51:06.520 --> 03:51:08.840
MATT: "Fetch her, we have much to discuss."

5035
03:51:08.840 --> 03:51:12.956
She stomps ever so quietly into the house.

5036
03:51:12.956 --> 03:51:13.830
TALIESIN: (ringing)

5037
03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:14.663
LAURA: No no no.

5038
03:51:14.663 --> 03:51:15.800
MATT: It's on the balcony.

5039
03:51:15.800 --> 03:51:16.644
TALIESIN: Oh, damn, damn.

5040
03:51:16.644 --> 03:51:18.850
(laughter)

5041
03:51:18.850 --> 03:51:20.640
MATT: The second set of chimes.

5042
03:51:20.640 --> 03:51:22.140
TRAVIS: That fucking doorbell.

5043
03:51:22.140 --> 03:51:24.006
TALIESIN: Thwarted again.

5044
03:51:24.006 --> 03:51:25.060
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up next week.

5045
03:51:25.060 --> 03:51:27.896
SAM: No wait, what? No! Come on.

5046
03:51:27.896 --> 03:51:28.757
MATT: It's almost 11:00.

5047
03:51:28.757 --> 03:51:29.870
SAM: (sighs)

5048
03:51:29.870 --> 03:51:31.810
MARISHA: Oh, I'm in trouble.

5049
03:51:31.810 --> 03:51:32.700
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5050
03:51:32.700 --> 03:51:35.857
MARISHA: I'm in trouble, I can just feel it.

5051
03:51:35.857 --> 03:51:37.735
Did you see the way she asked for me?
TRAVIS: ♪ Dairon's back and you're ♪

5052
03:51:37.735 --> 03:51:39.186
LAURA and TRAVIS: ♪ gonna be in trouble ♪

5053
03:51:39.186 --> 03:51:44.186
ALL: ♪ Hey-la, hey-la, Dairon's back! ♪

5054
03:51:44.571 --> 03:51:46.360
SAM: (descending slide whistle)

5055
03:51:46.360 --> 03:51:48.720
MATT: That slide whistle is gone forever now.

5056
03:51:48.720 --> 03:51:50.995
I'm going to throw it out.
SAM: Seven dollars.

5057
03:51:50.995 --> 03:51:52.095
Best money I've spent.
TALIESIN: Seven dollars

5058
03:51:52.095 --> 03:51:53.814
and never seen again.

5059
03:51:53.814 --> 03:51:55.320
LAURA: Oh no.

5060
03:51:55.320 --> 03:51:56.153
MATT: All right.

5061
03:51:56.153 --> 03:51:57.920
TALIESIN: That was really--

5062
03:51:57.920 --> 03:52:02.920
MATT: That was an emotional recovery episode

5063
03:52:03.090 --> 03:52:05.310
of the past few weeks.

5064
03:52:05.310 --> 03:52:06.460
LAURA: Yeah.

5065
03:52:06.460 --> 03:52:07.977
LIAM: Was it, though?

5066
03:52:07.977 --> 03:52:08.810
LAURA: Yeah.

5067
03:52:08.810 --> 03:52:10.620
MARISHA: Shit.
LAURA: Yeah.

5068
03:52:10.620 --> 03:52:12.370
MATT: Well, it had some elements of recovery,

5069
03:52:12.370 --> 03:52:16.130
some elements of continuous tension rising and puckering.

5070
03:52:16.130 --> 03:52:17.021
LAURA: Puckering.

5071
03:52:17.021 --> 03:52:19.270
(laughter)

5072
03:52:19.270 --> 03:52:20.753
LIAM: Mine is puckered!

5073
03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:24.199
MARISHA: What rises and puckers? Never mind.

5074
03:52:24.199 --> 03:52:26.349
MATT: No, anyway. Anyway!

5075
03:52:26.349 --> 03:52:27.274
TALIESIN: Starfish.

5076
03:52:28.250 --> 03:52:29.790
MATT: All right, so yeah.

5077
03:52:29.790 --> 03:52:32.330
We'll be back next Thursday to pick up from here

5078
03:52:32.330 --> 03:52:35.630
to see what Dairon has to say,

5079
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:40.630
as well as these chuckleheads figuring out their next,

5080
03:52:41.160 --> 03:52:44.573
I guess, the next steps and path to take.

5081
03:52:45.600 --> 03:52:49.657
In the meantime, hope you guys have a wonderful week,

5082
03:52:49.657 --> 03:52:50.900
we love you very much,

5083
03:52:50.900 --> 03:52:53.250
and is it Thursday yet?

5084
03:52:53.250 --> 03:52:54.299
Good night.

5085
03:52:54.299 --> 03:52:57.391
SAM: (slide whistle)
ALL: No!

5086
03:52:57.391 --> 03:52:59.891
[epic music]

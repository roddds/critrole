00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:04.218
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role! Where a bunch of us

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:06.876
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:07.933
TRAVIS: That's what we do!

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.917
LIAM: What's Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons?

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:18.452
MATT: You will find out, Liam. He who ran it
earlier for his daughter. Congratulations on them

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.439
making it through the--

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.885
LIAM: The Bonegrinder.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:23.319
MATT: The Bonegrinder, yeah.

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.532
LIAM: Those kids, some of my kids, my daughter had
some of the pie.

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:28.389
MATT: Yeah. You weren't going to tell them what it
was made of, and then you did.

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:29.378
LIAM: I wasn't, but I did.

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:30.368
TRAVIS: You let them live?

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:30.937
LIAM: Yes.

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:32.225
TRAVIS: You merciful lord.

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:37.335
MATT: Well, how much of them lived? It's Barovia,
to be fair. Anyway, welcome. Before we hop into

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:44.411
tonight's game, we have some announcements to get
through. First and foremost, I believe, if Sam is

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:49.591
ready, it looks like he's stretching himself. We
have our fantastic sponsor, for campaign two since

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.767
day one, our friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:53.100
TRAVIS: (singing) D&amp;amp;D Beyond!

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.693
MATT: Sam.

00:00:53.693 --> 00:00:58.450
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond everybody, they've been such great
sponsors, putting up with my shenanigans for so

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.159
long. So tonight I thought I would just do a
simple, normal ad read for them. Just singing

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.329
their praises of the service of the company, how
they're making D&amp;amp;D fun and easy again. So I just

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.710
wrote a little, quick little-- I left it at home
on my printer.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.624
LAURA: Oh no.

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:27.017
SAM: But it's okay, it's okay, no problem. I'm
essentially like an improv god, right? So I'll

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:38.345
just make something up on the fly. Just go from
the heart. Okay. I like D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:45.107
SAM: (VO as Mephistopheles) "Ugh, damn it, Sam.
You're blowing it. Come on, come up with

00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:46.735
"something, anything."

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:53.098
SAM: Because it works on PCs and Macintosh. And
that's very important because--

00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:59.183
SAM: "What! That's the best you've got. Macintosh!
What is this, 1997! Say something that helps them

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:00.452
"sell subscriptions!"

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:04.439
SAM: And their logo is neat.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.391
SAM: "Their logo is neat? Were you kicked in the
head by a donkey? Okay, forget the product, just

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.143
"be funny. Tell a joke."

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:17.966
SAM: Yeah! A priest and a rabbi walk into a strip
club at--

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:24.530
SAM: "No! No, no, no! Are you trying to offend
people? Look, just sing a song. At least Laura

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.091
"will pretend to enjoy it."

00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:32.413
SAM: Yeah. (singing) I'm gonna, get get get you
drunk. Get you love drunk on my humps. My humps,

00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:32.862
my humps--

00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:34.698
SAM: "Stop right now."

00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:35.637
LAURA: That's really good.

00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:42.458
SAM: "You are an idiot. Ugh, why did I make a
satanic deal with you? Your everlasting soul isn't

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:49.942
"worth this bullshit. I, Mephistopheles, hereby
release you from our pact. Go on, live your life

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:57.006
"without my constant help and sense of humor. Sam
Riegel, I, Satan, am done with you." (slamming)

00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:11.025
SAM: Oh! Wow, guys, I suddenly feel-- I feel like
that was a great D&amp;amp;D Beyond ad! And scene.

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:12.281
LAURA: Wow.

00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:14.583
LIAM: That really zigged when I thought it was
going to zag.

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.055
MATT: Yeah!

00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:17.619
TRAVIS: That was so good.

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.532
MATT: I will say, unfortunately, without Satan at
your back, I don't think you're allowed to play

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:23.165
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons anymore. It's kind of a
requirement.

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:28.741
TRAVIS: You gave up your ticket. The table's not a
free ticket, man. Come on.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.209
MATT: Yeah. If the 80s taught us anything.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.966
SAM: That's true.

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:35.380
MATT: Thank you, Sam. And thank you, to our
friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.264
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:42.106
MATT: All right, so a few other things to mention.
We put up a video on Wednesday announcing one of

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:48.548
our first upcoming series here on Critical Role's
channel entitled Handbooker Helper.

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:50.164
ALL: Yay!

00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:51.667
SAM: Sue us!

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:58.982
MATT: We were discussing how excitedly the people
in Hamburger Helper's marketing team are like,

00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:02.066
"Why this sudden uptick in interest in our
brand?"

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.255
SAM: They're flying off the shelves!

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:05.653
MARISHA: Sponsor us!

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:12.810
MATT: So if you guys want to sponsor Handbooker
Helper, let us know. Yeah, so anyway, it's going

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.007
to be a short form series. Bite-sized video
snippets, introducing people who have either never

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:24.671
played Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons or want a bit of a
refresher course on the 5th edition rules from the

00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.944
handbook, but in very easy to understand
presentory fashion.

00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:30.418
MARISHA: Bite-sized segments!

00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:31.137
MATT: Yes.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.513
MARISHA: Five minutes or less.

00:04:32.513 --> 00:04:36.016
MATT: We can't tell you how many people we've been
like, "You wanna know how to play D&amp;amp;D?" And we

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.307
show them the book and they go (breathy
recoiling). So hopefully this will help alleviate

00:04:40.307 --> 00:04:44.691
for some folks that issue and get some more folks
that you've been wanting to get on board with the

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:50.369
game to play with you in your campaign a little
more of a softer introduction to the game. Look

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:53.750
forward to that. It launches on August 29th, right
around the corner, it's going to be our first

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.887
episode. So look for information on critrole.com.
Marisha, did you have anything you wanted to

00:04:57.887 --> 00:04:58.847
mention on that?

00:04:58.847 --> 00:05:01.845
MARISHA: And on YouTube on Wednesdays. On our Crit
Role YouTube.

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:02.735
MATT: Hell yeah.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:03.764
MARISHA: Yeah, next Wednesday.

00:05:03.764 --> 00:05:07.304
SAM: Is the Critical Role YouTube channel called
"Critical Role" or "Crit Role"?

00:05:07.304 --> 00:05:10.459
MARISHA: youtube.com/criticalrole, I believe.

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.726
MATT: But if you're confused, all that information
is on critrole.com

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:20.620
MARISHA: If anyone owns criticalrole.com, message
us back.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.649
MATT: Please.

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:26.488
SAM: Weirdly, the Hamburger Helper organization
owns it.

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:28.480
(laughter)

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.407
TALIESIN: Big Helper.

00:05:29.407 --> 00:05:31.921
TRAVIS: The fucking glove. The glove is like--

00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:35.188
TALIESIN: We've been really trying to talk to the
glove.

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:42.571
MATT: Also, for those of you guys who didn't
notice, tomorrow, our production team here at

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:47.197
Critical Role Land are going to be answering
fantastic questions from the community about the

00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:52.837
whole production with this crazy, zany bunch of
people. It'll be tomorrow on the Critical Role

00:05:52.837 --> 00:05:57.923
subreddit at 2:00pm Pacific Time. They'll be on
there live answering questions, discussing all the

00:05:57.923 --> 00:06:03.151
chaos behind the scenes that you guys have wanted
to know about. This was, if you don't recall, a

00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:07.236
special incentive that was unlocked from our
fantastic 826LA charity stream that we ran a few

00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:11.962
months back. Thank you for supporting 826 and
making it a fantastic charity push and we're happy

00:06:11.962 --> 00:06:18.645
to bring you this next leg of that reward journey
back to you. So check it out. As a reminder, next

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:25.149
week on Thursday will not be an in-canon episode
as me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be off in a

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:29.866
dusty place. But that doesn't mean there's not
going to be a game. Actually, we are going to have

00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:32.760
a one-shot next week run by our fantastic Liam
O'Brien.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.490
(cheering)

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.772
MATT: Liam, if you want to talk a little bit about
what and who.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:42.507
LIAM: Yes, sure. I, too, am dying for the Laura
Bailey one-shot, but she has a baby or something.

00:06:42.507 --> 00:06:47.496
So we're going to wait a little bit longer, but
it's coming. I don't want to give away too much,

00:06:47.496 --> 00:06:53.370
but I'll tell you who's playing. We have La La,
Sam, and Travis will be part of the game. And we

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.919
are bringing in friends TJ Storm--

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.760
LAURA AND SAM: Yay!

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.318
LIAM: And Erica Luttrell. Both great actors, fun
to play with. Again, I don't want to spoil

00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:07.361
anything, but I will say that it will be focusing
heavily on motherfucking werewolves!

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:09.473
TRAVIS: (shouting) Motherfucking werewolves!

00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:11.648
(howling)

00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:14.203
LIAM: Late happy birthday present to Travis
Willingham.

00:07:14.203 --> 00:07:19.858
MATT: So excited. I'm glad we finally got TJ on,
too, because he's great.

00:07:19.858 --> 00:07:20.796
LIAM: Yes.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:24.654
MATT: If you guys don't know TJ Storm, look up his
stuff. He's a phenomenal actor, great physical

00:07:24.654 --> 00:07:28.960
performance capture and motion capture actor. I've
worked with him on many video games, a lot of us

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.698
have. He's phenomenal, but he's also the kind of
guy who I had no idea was a huge D&amp;amp;D nerd until we

00:07:35.698 --> 00:07:40.875
got in an offhand conversation years ago. He's like
this tall, muscular, long dreads, black dude.

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:42.911
TRAVIS: He's in the Karate Hall of Fame or
something like that.

00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:43.519
SAM: He is?

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:51.030
MATT: Yeah. He's incredible and has been dungeon
mastering for 20 plus years, I think. We've played

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.605
a number of games together and he's awesome. So
excited to have him on the show.

00:07:53.605 --> 00:07:59.509
LIAM: I met him years ago in Japan doing mocap and
on all our breaks he was just playing Civ on his

00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:06.994
PC and telling me all about D&amp;amp;D. This predates all
our D&amp;amp;D, so he is DPB. Dick in the Peanut Butter.

00:08:06.994 --> 00:08:08.455
Really gets into the game.

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:12.001
(laughter)

00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:12.575
TRAVIS: What?!

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.757
MATT: All right then.

00:08:13.757 --> 00:08:14.872
TRAVIS: Is that a term?

00:08:14.872 --> 00:08:16.291
LIAM: I don't wanna speak for you, TJ.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:17.254
TALIESIN: That was smooth.

00:08:17.254 --> 00:08:18.351
TRAVIS: DPTB?!

00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:19.430
LIAM: Better than chunky.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.089
TALIESIN: Well, there you go.

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:24.819
TRAVIS: Can we use that all the time, please? Dick
in the peanut butter!

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:28.193
LAURA: Great, that's what I'm going to hear at
home all the time now.

00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:29.075
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.101
MATT: Congratulations.

00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:30.893
SAM: Teach your son.

00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:35.279
LIAM: (baby talk voice) Oh, who's DPB? Who's DPB?

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.203
MATT: Oh god.

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:38.065
TRAVIS: (baby talk voice) Little dick in the
peanut butter?

00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:40.751
(laughter)

00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:44.964
MATT: I've already lost control and we haven't
even started the game. Last but not least, when we

00:08:44.964 --> 00:08:50.611
get at the break, we'll be having our Wyrmwood
giveaway. The giveaway will be requiring you to

00:08:50.611 --> 00:08:56.143
come over into the Critical Role chat room,
twitch.tv/criticalrole. We'll keep you up to speed

00:08:56.143 --> 00:09:01.008
when all that's happening. I think that's it,
unless we have anything else to mention.

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:10.337
LAURA: Oh, go to the store and check out
shop.critrole.com. Did I get it right? There's

00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:14.725
t-shirts, and there's a bumper sticker that says
something about the Traveler, and you know we all

00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:15.406
love that.

00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:18.660
TRAVIS: Retro tee, critter cap, Mighty Nein tee,
Vox Machina pin.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.454
SAM: Dad cap!

00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:22.740
LAURA: They know what there is! And some pins,
check it out. Maybe there's pins, maybe there's

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.532
not. Maybe you should go check it out to find
out.

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:28.632
TALIESIN: Could be anything!

00:09:28.632 --> 00:09:33.882
MATT: This is the worst ARG element of our whole
show's campaign. Go find out!

00:09:33.882 --> 00:09:35.983
TALIESIN: There might be a surprise. If there is,
tell us!

00:09:35.983 --> 00:09:42.590
MATT: With that being said, let's go ahead and
bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role!

00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:45.211
LIAM: (caterwauling)

00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.443
[click, TV static]

00:09:48.443 --> 00:11:06.318
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:11:06.318 --> 00:11:08.109
MATT: And welcome back.

00:11:08.109 --> 00:11:08.947
TRAVIS: DTPB.

00:11:08.947 --> 00:11:11.543
(laughter)

00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:18.824
MATT: Last we left off, The Mighty Nein, having
completed their journey north and their two jobs

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:26.973
for The Gentleman, return with a new friend, a new
companion, and the memory of an old. You spent two

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:34.499
weeks in Zadash utilizing your downtime; some to a
very successful level, some at a nearly terribly

00:11:34.499 --> 00:11:42.057
not successful level, but managing to skirt by.
You've taken your time, decided on a new path, a

00:11:42.057 --> 00:11:47.550
new adventure ahead of you, loaded up your things
and currently with your cart, horses, and selves

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:53.959
together. You begin making your way towards the
southern area of Zadash and out towards the roads

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:59.252
ahead. So this is your very last chance: if
there's anything you need to do in the city, or

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:00.186
forever hold your peace.

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:01.574
TRAVIS: I need to pee.

00:12:01.574 --> 00:12:03.999
MATT: Roll a constitution check.

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:04.615
LIAM: Too real.

00:12:04.615 --> 00:12:05.175
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:07.857
TALIESIN: Do we want to raid the adult bookstore
one more time? Just kidding.

00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:08.737
TRAVIS: 21.

00:12:08.737 --> 00:12:11.492
MATT: 21. You can hold it for three more days.

00:12:11.492 --> 00:12:13.232
TRAVIS: Okay good, 20.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:17.169
TALIESIN: You're just going to make a sloshing
sound when you walk for a while.

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:22.242
LIAM: Caleb has to find new garage sales to dive
through.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.280
TALIESIN: I am all for that.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:32.265
MATT: As you guys reach the southern gates to the
exterior of Zadash, with the creaking of chains

00:12:32.265 --> 00:12:38.335
and the heavy (thudding) as the large wooden
barriers slowly drift open to allow you and a few

00:12:38.335 --> 00:12:43.729
other carts outward onto the main road. You glance
out onto the southern hills below you in the

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:49.708
Marrow Valley and you can see the faint dusting of
distant snow that has begun to melt in the recent

00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:55.807
warmer days that have come. The roads themselves
are slick and heavy with mud from the snow and

00:12:55.807 --> 00:13:01.398
rainfall that has managed to still seep in. You
can hear hooves making their way through the mud

00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:07.933
as you push past the barrier. Now last time you
were here, you recall seeing large numbers of

00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:13.838
military that had gathered of the Righteous Brand
of which there are very few left, it looks like

00:13:13.838 --> 00:13:18.267
most have gone eastward and found their way
towards the skirmishes you continue to hear about

00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:28.968
on the borders of Xhorhas and the Ashguard
Garrison. The gates close behind you, and you

00:13:28.968 --> 00:13:34.799
begin making your way now free again in the Marrow
Valley southward towards your destination of the

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:40.434
Menagerie Coast. First off, who is going to be
guiding this first leg of the path? That is three

00:13:40.434 --> 00:13:46.768
days of travel to Alfield along the road. Who's
going to be keeping an eye out? All right, we have

00:13:46.768 --> 00:13:48.238
Caleb for that. Anybody helping Caleb?

00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:49.319
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll help Caleb.

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:50.482
TALIESIN: You think you got it? All right.

00:13:50.942 --> 00:13:55.245
TRAVIS: Since we've traveled this once before. Did
you want to join?

00:13:55.245 --> 00:13:56.799
LAURA: No, it's fine.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.933
TRAVIS: I mean, ladies first if you--

00:13:58.933 --> 00:14:00.128
LAURA: No, it's all you.

00:14:00.128 --> 00:14:06.964
MATT: Because I glossed over this last session.
Caleb, as you sit there, holding the reins to the

00:14:06.964 --> 00:14:12.188
horses in front and you're focusing ahead, your
mind slips back into contemplative thought

00:14:12.188 --> 00:14:20.122
recalling the time you had spent focusing on the
dodecahedron, remembering when you had spent a bit

00:14:20.122 --> 00:14:24.816
of time over this two-week break studying and
trying your best to understand the nature of its

00:14:24.816 --> 00:14:32.875
enchantment or history. It's a strange device to
behold for sure. It both seems refined and primal.

00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:41.369
You have no idea the source or the length of time
that it's existed or what its true purpose is.

00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:48.962
Focusing onto it, once again allowing your
consciousness to slip gently towards wherever this

00:14:48.962 --> 00:14:56.943
object draws it in. It feels like you're looking
into infinite space both within and beyond this

00:14:56.943 --> 00:15:08.910
small geometric shape. You take a moment to focus.
You can sense and see light and cloud and matter

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:18.575
and vacuum, this kind of expanse of everything and
nothing between these long stretches. You feel

00:15:18.575 --> 00:15:25.429
like there's an absence around you, but the more
time you spend, the more you adjust to the space,

00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:31.265
the more your vision clarifies, the more the
darkness is not pure darkness but a weave of

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:40.588
millions of tiny threads, all moving, faintly
traveling in different directions, tugged by some

00:15:40.588 --> 00:15:47.528
unseen force independently. You watch one thread,
you pick one focus, and you can see it pulling

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:57.677
along. And it brightens and brightens and
brightens until it reaches, in that tiny little

00:15:57.677 --> 00:16:06.534
infinitesimal push, a burst of light, and it
changes direction. And you see in that space where

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:12.267
that burst of light had happened, you see seven
other shadow-threads begin to emerge from that

00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:19.078
point that then fade away to nothing, the thread
having now curved and taken a different path. A

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:29.598
choice, a decision made, and a different destiny
for whatever that strange thread is following. And

00:16:29.598 --> 00:16:37.155
pulling back, you now see the thousands, tens of
thousands, millions of these that all wander in

00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:46.388
their own independent, solitary directions, some
crossing, some parallel, some alone. And you

00:16:46.388 --> 00:16:51.919
wonder what all of this means, and what this has
to do with the essence of this device, the powers

00:16:51.919 --> 00:17:03.492
that it seems to impart, and what it is that the
Kryn Dynasty has designs for. You come back in to

00:17:03.492 --> 00:17:09.985
your moment on the cart as you're rocking back and
forth down the pathway, hearing the hooves on the

00:17:09.985 --> 00:17:19.320
muddy-- now getting drier-- portions of the
roadway. You glance around at your friends and

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.979
shake your head for a moment, and focus once more
on the road before you.

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:27.737
TALIESIN: Mr. Caleb--

00:17:28.384 --> 00:17:29.477
MARISHA: That's an old joke.

00:17:29.477 --> 00:17:35.294
TALIESIN: What are you playing with over there?
Seemed really intent on whatever it was.

00:17:35.294 --> 00:17:40.067
LIAM: Oh, I'm thinking back on it now?

00:17:40.067 --> 00:17:40.552
MATT: Yeah.

00:17:40.552 --> 00:17:47.177
LIAM: Ask Jester to show you the thingy in her
bag.

00:17:47.177 --> 00:17:48.734
LAURA: Ooh.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.535
LIAM: Okay, ignore that.

00:17:51.535 --> 00:17:55.727
TALIESIN: It's too late, I'm already ready for it.
All right.

00:17:55.727 --> 00:18:01.299
LIAM: It's something we picked up the first time
we came through Zadash.

00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:09.330
TALIESIN: Gotcha. Hey, Miss Jester? Apparently you
picked something up in Zadash-- I'm supposed to

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.377
see the thingy in your bag?

00:18:10.377 --> 00:18:13.242
LAURA: Which thingy?

00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:15.679
TALIESIN: I don't know. Caleb was being very
shifty about it.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:19.373
LAURA: There's some really questionable thingies
in here, but you can see them if you want.

00:18:19.373 --> 00:18:21.254
TALIESIN: I'd like to see any questionable thing
you may have.

00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:22.559
LAURA: Okay, well, there's that.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.827
TALIESIN: What is that?

00:18:23.827 --> 00:18:25.155
LAURA: You don't want to know.

00:18:25.155 --> 00:18:26.187
TALIESIN: Is that even natural?

00:18:26.187 --> 00:18:32.340
LAURA: Well. And then there's that thingy. Caleb
doesn't know about it, but he will later. And

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.145
then-- oh! Were you talking about this? It's this
box.

00:18:35.145 --> 00:18:36.153
TALIESIN: What is this thing?

00:18:36.153 --> 00:18:37.956
LAURA: Okay. Well, inside of it--

00:18:37.956 --> 00:18:40.297
MATT: It's gone critical!

00:18:40.297 --> 00:18:45.857
LAURA: Open it up and just let your mind go and
see what you think.

00:18:45.857 --> 00:18:47.932
TALIESIN: I'm going to meditate into the box.

00:18:47.932 --> 00:18:56.967
MATT: Okay. You focus, and you're familiar-- Roll
a third character.

00:18:56.967 --> 00:19:03.500
(laughter)

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.322
TALIESIN: Too soon.

00:19:04.322 --> 00:19:10.464
MATT: You, who have spent a large portion of your
life in various states of meditation, the

00:19:10.464 --> 00:19:18.735
gravitational pull of whatever essence of this
object is, is something you are familiar with and

00:19:18.735 --> 00:19:24.681
comfortable letting take over. And with that, your
consciousness slips seemingly beyond your physical

00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:30.491
form and into whatever dark space it seems to have
drawn you towards. In this space, you begin to

00:19:30.491 --> 00:19:36.629
very quickly pick up on details similar to what
Caleb had taken so long to focus on.

00:19:36.629 --> 00:19:45.145
Independently, you begin to pick up the themes and
the ideas of what all these strange threads, these--

00:19:45.756 --> 00:19:47.514
TALIESIN: Does this place make me feel a little
uncomfortable?

00:19:47.514 --> 00:19:58.544
MATT: No? It's-- it feels in a weird way like
you're--

00:19:58.544 --> 00:20:01.251
(bird sounds)

00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:02.677
MARISHA: (whispers) They're in the rafters!

00:20:02.677 --> 00:20:03.790
SAM: No it's good, it's good, leave it!

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.910
MATT: I'm just turning it down.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.907
MARISHA: Pigeons everywhere.

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:12.059
MATT: Shh. We're roleplaying, Marisha.

00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:18.529
(laughter)

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:27.595
MATT: It doesn't feel unnatural. It feels like a
view behind the curtain.

00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:28.576
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:20:28.576 --> 00:20:35.423
MATT: Is the best way I can describe it. But it
doesn't bother you. It's a little cold and a

00:20:35.423 --> 00:20:39.354
little alien, but it doesn't feel unnatural.

00:20:39.354 --> 00:20:40.180
TALIESIN: All right.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:48.389
MATT: As you pull back, you feel something comes
back with you. And as your consciousness

00:20:48.389 --> 00:20:58.222
refocuses, there's a slight shred of milky grey
energy that withdraws itself and then, with a warm

00:20:58.222 --> 00:21:01.391
impact, disappears into your chest.

00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:09.032
TALIESIN: Huh. I think I have a passenger, and
that's interesting.

00:21:09.032 --> 00:21:13.372
LAURA: Did you see the little ball, the little
grey ball?

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:13.976
TALIESIN: I did.

00:21:13.976 --> 00:21:15.391
LAURA: Wasn't it weird?

00:21:15.391 --> 00:21:16.266
TALIESIN: It was.

00:21:16.266 --> 00:21:17.870
LAURA: Is he inside of you now?

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.283
TALIESIN: He is. It is.

00:21:19.283 --> 00:21:21.781
LAURA: Oh, you think it's an it, not a he?

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:25.024
TALIESIN: I'm trying to not make assumptions.

00:21:25.024 --> 00:21:28.002
LIAM: Hurry up and stuff that thing back in her
bag.

00:21:28.002 --> 00:21:30.788
LAURA: Oh, that's right. People are looking for
it.

00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:36.473
TALIESIN: Good to know. I'll keep-- mum's the
word. Huh.

00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:40.442
MARISHA: Yeah, it's nice, right? It's like a
little post-coital feeling, kind of.

00:21:40.442 --> 00:21:44.744
TALIESIN: I wouldn't know, but--

00:21:44.744 --> 00:21:48.913
TRAVIS: Has everybody focused on that thing now?

00:21:48.913 --> 00:21:51.817
SAM, MARISHA, LAURA: I have.

00:21:51.817 --> 00:21:54.342
TRAVIS: I should probably do that at some point.

00:21:54.342 --> 00:21:57.634
TALIESIN: You should probably experience this,
it's interesting.

00:21:57.634 --> 00:22:00.784
LIAM: You are not allowed to-- you know.

00:22:00.784 --> 00:22:05.234
TRAVIS: Oh, no! I wouldn't (hums). I just want to
look.

00:22:05.234 --> 00:22:08.986
LAURA: You can't look at it, though, today.

00:22:08.986 --> 00:22:09.666
TRAVIS: Why not?

00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:11.553
LAURA: Because he already has it.

00:22:11.553 --> 00:22:12.593
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

00:22:12.593 --> 00:22:14.628
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:22:14.628 --> 00:22:17.350
LAURA: You have so many balls inside of you
already.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.733
MARISHA: It's true.

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:20.140
LIAM: Ja, balls deep.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.294
LAURA: Lots of them.

00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:23.758
TRAVIS: Leave it alone.

00:22:23.758 --> 00:22:26.622
MARISHA: I know, so close!

00:22:26.622 --> 00:22:28.239
TRAVIS: Razor's edge.

00:22:28.239 --> 00:22:32.479
MATT: Caleb, I'd like you to roll a perception
check with advantage with Caduceus's aid.

00:22:32.479 --> 00:22:34.604
LIAM: Thank you for bringing it back to the
material plane.

00:22:34.604 --> 00:22:36.062
MATT: Welcome back in.

00:22:39.302 --> 00:22:41.910
LIAM: That is pretty good. That's an 18.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:49.303
MATT: 18, okay. As you progress for the first
couple of days, heading south along the road,

00:22:49.303 --> 00:22:58.057
camping without issue, at the beginning of the
third day, when you've begun taking your camp and

00:22:58.057 --> 00:23:00.507
reassembling it, making your way back to the
road--

00:23:00.507 --> 00:23:06.781
LIAM: Point of order: there's also a hut, now, as
part of the nightly routine.

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:12.760
MATT: That's right, yeah. Which is still visible,
but impenetrable. And there has not been an issue.

00:23:12.833 --> 00:23:17.656
You do wake up and notice that there maybe have
been a few tracks that made their way towards your

00:23:17.656 --> 00:23:25.989
camp. They appear to be hoof-based in nature, but
had wandered and circled around and made their way

00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:31.449
beyond your location. Probably just something
natural in the vicinity that was curious about

00:23:31.449 --> 00:23:38.472
what this strange dome was in the space where you
had made camp. But you gather your things, you

00:23:38.472 --> 00:23:44.708
make your way onto your cart, and with the better
part of the next-- the third day's travel, right

00:23:44.708 --> 00:23:53.133
as the sun begins to set, you can see ahead the
small treeline that surrounds the now-glowing

00:23:53.133 --> 00:23:55.145
windows of the town of Alfield.

00:23:55.145 --> 00:23:57.831
MARISHA: Back in Alfield.

00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:59.696
LAURA: Back to the beginning of our notes.

00:23:59.696 --> 00:24:06.819
MARISHA: This is where Bryce lives, right? We
should check in with Bryce.

00:24:06.819 --> 00:24:12.056
LIAM: Is it looking as we near it-- is it looking
a little more put back together?

00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:17.776
MATT: As you begin to go closer, you can see--
while there's still light in the sky, you can see

00:24:17.776 --> 00:24:23.978
that there are a number of building structures
that have been reframed, and it looks like there

00:24:23.978 --> 00:24:28.839
was both a volunteer effort, as well as a number
of hired masons and volunteers, that are in the

00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:32.258
process of rebuilding a lot of what had been
damaged or burned down when the gnolls had

00:24:32.258 --> 00:24:36.775
originally assaulted it the last time you were
here. By the time you reach the actual streets,

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:42.627
making your way along the one central thoroughfare
that cuts across the center of town, you can see

00:24:42.627 --> 00:24:47.160
some of the folks who are finishing up their daily
work. As they're losing light, some light up

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.493
torches, and continue to work and toil into the
early hours of the evening. Others begin to close

00:24:52.493 --> 00:24:57.357
up, taking their ladders down, finishing for the
day's work, and make their way to local tavern or

00:24:57.357 --> 00:25:03.385
homestead to make food and bed down for the
evening. But as you pass by, a few folks do notice

00:25:03.385 --> 00:25:07.965
your presence, look over at the cart, and
recognize you, and wave in your direction.

00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:09.697
TRAVIS: How do?

00:25:09.697 --> 00:25:17.765
MATT: They wave and seem almost nervous, excited
but both not quite sure how to act in your

00:25:17.886 --> 00:25:27.180
presence. You see one familiar halfling, who had
previously lost his entire inn, who glances over

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:27.828
in your direction.

00:25:27.828 --> 00:25:28.947
SAM: Thadeus Candleglow?

00:25:28.947 --> 00:25:29.571
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:30.321
SAM: Yes!

00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:31.763
TRAVIS: Damn, note taker.

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:32.893
LAURA: It's right there.

00:25:32.893 --> 00:25:34.860
TRAVIS: Ten points to Gryffindor, fuck.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:43.721
MATT: He runs up, and you can see there's a lot of
dust and bits of wood splinters on the shoulders

00:25:43.721 --> 00:25:50.106
and edges of the sleeves as the halfling runs up
and glances over and goes, "I wasn't expecting to

00:25:50.106 --> 00:25:58.270
"see y'all return. Things are going along well.
We're doing what we can."

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.492
LAURA: How much have you built back already?

00:26:01.492 --> 00:26:07.007
MATT: "Well, we've gotten the basis of the bottom
floor mostly restored structurally. We're going to

00:26:07.007 --> 00:26:11.838
"try and fill in the walls, and then we'll head on
to the second floor there. I surmise we probably

00:26:11.838 --> 00:26:15.650
"have another four months or so before we're up and
operational."

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.085
LAURA: Not bad, though, really.

00:26:18.085 --> 00:26:19.665
TRAVIS: Really good progress, yeah.

00:26:19.665 --> 00:26:25.411
MATT: "Well, I can lend that to most of these fine
folks who've been so gracious in helping." He

00:26:25.411 --> 00:26:29.237
points to a few other people who have either left
or are in the process of packaging up their tools

00:26:29.237 --> 00:26:38.077
and materials as well. They kind of acknowledge
and glance over. "I wish I could give you a room

00:26:38.077 --> 00:26:40.330
"to stay in. I'd do it free of charge, but--"

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.791
LAURA: We don't need one. We have this magical
dome that we sleep in, now. It's really cool.

00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.014
MATT: "Wow. Whoa."

00:26:47.014 --> 00:26:50.074
LAURA: You should rent some of those out. I bet
people would really like it.

00:26:50.074 --> 00:26:50.741
TALIESIN: Magic domes.

00:26:50.741 --> 00:26:52.746
MATT: "I'll get right on it."

00:26:52.746 --> 00:26:54.154
MARISHA: Shift pods.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:56.517
TALIESIN: I wasn't going to say it.

00:26:56.517 --> 00:27:02.075
MATT: "Well, anyway, I don't want to take any more
of your time. I just saw you coming through and

00:27:02.075 --> 00:27:02.836
"wanted to say thank you."

00:27:02.836 --> 00:27:03.437
MARISHA: Hey, Thadeus.

00:27:03.437 --> 00:27:04.074
MATT: "Yeah?"

00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:05.002
MARISHA: Is Bryce in?

00:27:05.361 --> 00:27:11.204
MATT: "They should be. I haven't seen them around
very recently, but if you're going to find them

00:27:11.204 --> 00:27:13.652
"somewhere in here, they're probably--"

00:27:13.652 --> 00:27:14.210
MARISHA: Broad Barn?

00:27:14.297 --> 00:27:21.338
MATT: "Probably at the Broad Barn. Or--" Actually,
Bryce would be--

00:27:21.338 --> 00:27:22.743
TRAVIS: Candleglow? No.

00:27:22.743 --> 00:27:24.891
MATT: No, Candleglow was the inn that he is
currently--

00:27:24.891 --> 00:27:30.623
LIAM: There's the Feed &amp;amp; Mead Tavern, there's
Broad Barn, there's Crate and Barrel.

00:27:33.863 --> 00:27:36.791
MATT: "Bryce would probably be over at the Salt
Trench."

00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:37.562
SAM: The jail.

00:27:37.562 --> 00:27:44.807
MATT: "Yeah, that's where they've been keeping
their attention as of late." Look at you taking

00:27:44.807 --> 00:27:46.207
notes. I'm so proud.

00:27:46.207 --> 00:27:49.073
SAM: No one else on this side of the table is
going to take any meaningful notes.

00:27:49.073 --> 00:27:51.100
LAURA: No, I have, they're just mostly--

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.162
SAM: It's dick pics all over the place.

00:27:52.162 --> 00:27:54.092
MATT: That's important, too!

00:27:54.092 --> 00:27:58.505
LAURA: It's memory lane. I see a big head of
something shaped like a bowling ball.

00:27:58.505 --> 00:28:00.463
SAM: And this one looks like a poo in a bathtub.

00:28:00.463 --> 00:28:03.008
LAURA: It is, it's a stinky-- but that was Caleb,
I think.

00:28:03.008 --> 00:28:05.193
TALIESIN: Yeah, I remember that.

00:28:05.193 --> 00:28:06.171
LIAM: Good times.

00:28:06.171 --> 00:28:09.215
MARISHA: I'm finding a bunch of old dumb jokes.

00:28:09.215 --> 00:28:12.534
TALIESIN: It's a very good bathtub, it's got claw
feet. I appreciate that.

00:28:12.534 --> 00:28:19.950
MARISHA: This isn't where we left-- no. This isn't
where we left Reginald? No, okay.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.693
TRAVIS: Let's make our way over there.

00:28:22.693 --> 00:28:24.259
SAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:28:24.259 --> 00:28:28.522
MATT: So, heading over to the eastern side of
town, you start finding the edge of the forest

00:28:28.787 --> 00:28:35.301
where the street of Alfield comes to an end, and
the furthest building towards the forest-- you've

00:28:35.301 --> 00:28:41.843
passed it before, but not spent much time in its
proximity-- is a dark grey stone building with a

00:28:41.843 --> 00:28:49.528
dark, weathered wood frame set around it, torches
set exterior, and it has the simple sign that says

00:28:49.528 --> 00:28:55.189
the Salt Trench Jail. There is one crownsguard
who's kind of leaning against the wall. It looks

00:28:55.189 --> 00:29:01.319
like they're not asleep, but definitely not in
full energy, per se. Long piece of some sort of a

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:06.990
wheat dangling out of their mouth; they're
chewing. "Hey, can I help you?"

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.946
LAURA: Hey, we're here to see Bryce.

00:29:08.946 --> 00:29:13.210
MATT: "I'm going to go see if they're available.
I'll be right back."

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.496
LAURA: He looked like he didn't even remember us.

00:29:15.496 --> 00:29:16.738
SAM: Maybe he's new.

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:18.823
TRAVIS: Yeah, he could be reinforcements.

00:29:18.823 --> 00:29:21.194
LAURA: We killed a whole bunch of gnolls for
them.

00:29:21.194 --> 00:29:22.621
MARISHA: To be fair, I don't remember him.

00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:27.525
TRAVIS: Hey, Caduceus, you should probably be
aware: we fought off a bunch of gnolls when we

00:29:27.525 --> 00:29:29.261
were making our way up through here.

00:29:29.261 --> 00:29:31.681
LAURA: We cut off their ears and sold them for
money.

00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:34.723
TRAVIS: What kind of gnolls, you ask? Regular.

00:29:34.723 --> 00:29:36.094
TALIESIN: Do I know what a gnoll is?

00:29:36.094 --> 00:29:37.550
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.119
TALIESIN: 11.

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:47.389
MATT: Yeah, you've heard of gnolls. You've never
seen one, you've never encountered one, but as far

00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:50.478
as your knowledge goes, they're just nasty big dog
people.

00:29:50.478 --> 00:29:54.860
MARISHA: Sometimes they aren't regular, though--
sometimes they're undead ones.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.486
TALIESIN: Irregular gnolls.

00:29:56.486 --> 00:29:58.508
MARISHA: Yeah. But we fought both.

00:29:58.508 --> 00:29:59.496
TALIESIN: Irregular ones.

00:29:59.496 --> 00:30:01.677
TRAVIS: Harder to fit in what we want to--

00:30:01.677 --> 00:30:09.271
MATT: At this point, the guard comes back, pokes
through the doorway. "May I ask who's asking?"

00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:11.426
TRAVIS: Yeah, The Mighty Nein has come calling.

00:30:12.407 --> 00:30:14.042
SAM: Were we called that back then?

00:30:14.042 --> 00:30:14.650
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:15.253
SAM: I don't remember.

00:30:15.253 --> 00:30:16.360
MATT: Actually, that's where you coined the name.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.262
SAM: Oh, good, yeah.

00:30:17.262 --> 00:30:18.042
TRAVIS: Yep, that's it.

00:30:18.042 --> 00:30:24.877
MATT: "All right, let me go check," and heads back
in. About a moment passes and you hear some

00:30:24.877 --> 00:30:30.460
footsteps coming and there you see coming through
the doorway Bryce, helmet off, they're still

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:37.195
wearing their armor. They look a bit overworked,
maybe not getting enough sleep, a little bit of

00:30:37.195 --> 00:30:45.078
dark circles under the eyes, but other than that
healthy. Their blond, shoulder-length hair has a

00:30:45.078 --> 00:30:49.504
soft curl to it, is pulled up in the back, and
looks to be tied to keep out of the way. As they

00:30:49.504 --> 00:30:59.159
come through the door frame, a smile on their
face. "I wasn't expecting company, let alone such welcome--"

00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:00.438
LIAM: Nabend.

00:31:00.438 --> 00:31:02.293
MATT: "It's good to see you."

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:05.006
MARISHA: What are you doing here? You working here
now?

00:31:05.006 --> 00:31:10.851
MATT: "I'm working wherever it's necessary. I keep
watch on here, I help the Starosta maintain

00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:14.966
"general matters here with the Crownsguard, but
stationed wherever it's necessary. We're a bit

00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:21.835
"light on manpower given the bulk of it is required
now to the eastern side of the Empire."

00:31:21.835 --> 00:31:24.706
LAURA: Ooh, so, if we're going to commit a crime,
now would be a good time, huh?

00:31:24.706 --> 00:31:25.364
TRAVIS: Jester!

00:31:25.364 --> 00:31:31.610
MATT: "In theory, which is why I'm not sleeping as
well. But it's good to see you, Jester."

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:32.311
LAURA: You too.

00:31:32.311 --> 00:31:34.142
TRAVIS: How has it been? Busy? Peaceful?

00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:34.971
MATT: "Both."

00:31:34.971 --> 00:31:36.521
LIAM: Any trouble here, at home?

00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:44.325
MATT: "None, thankfully. We took them down last
week, but it was decided that recovering some of

00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:50.192
"these gnolls that you had slaughtered and-- as
garish as it was-- placing their heads as a

00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:56.433
"warning on the outskirts of town prevented, for a
while, any sort of incursions. Seemed to be a

00:31:56.433 --> 00:32:00.357
"decent deterrent. However, the smell got a bit
intense for the farmers and we decided to dispose

00:32:00.357 --> 00:32:08.099
"of them. But everything seems fine. We're far
enough from all that chaos to the east. How's

00:32:08.099 --> 00:32:12.568
"everything been with you? Last I saw you, you were
heading to Zadash. I apologize, it took a little

00:32:12.568 --> 00:32:18.521
"bit with the chaos here, but I just sent a report
up to the Lawmaster up there. Orentha should know

00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:19.707
"of your deeds soon."

00:32:23.217 --> 00:32:25.867
SAM: Thank you for that, that's very kind.

00:32:25.867 --> 00:32:29.420
LAURA: Did you just call us The Mighty Nein or did
you describe what we look like?

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.608
MATT: "I gave a brief description."

00:32:34.168 --> 00:32:35.219
TALIESIN: I'm new.

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:37.760
MATT: "Right. What's your name?"

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.938
TALIESIN: Caduceus. Caduceus Clay. Pleasure.
You're a lot shorter than the last one they--

00:32:41.938 --> 00:32:43.330
MATT: "Bryce. Bryce Feelid."

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.543
TALIESIN: Introduced me to.

00:32:44.543 --> 00:32:50.089
MATT: "That's all right. Pleasure to meet you. You
are very tall and... strange."

00:32:50.089 --> 00:32:54.086
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've noticed everybody else is
very short. It's fascinating.

00:32:54.086 --> 00:32:58.502
MATT: "Well, welcome to Alfield. Any friends of
these are friends of ours."

00:32:58.502 --> 00:33:00.579
TALIESIN: Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:03.865
MATT: "Of course. Are you passing through? Or
you've come to stay for a bit?"

00:33:03.865 --> 00:33:04.956
SAM: Passing through.

00:33:04.956 --> 00:33:08.435
LIAM: Yeah, maybe stay for the night before moving
on?

00:33:08.435 --> 00:33:12.777
MATT: "Well, of course, of course. You need not
worry about finding lodging, we can have that arranged."

00:33:12.914 --> 00:33:13.868
LAURA: Oh, wow, thank you!

00:33:13.868 --> 00:33:18.404
MATT: "We've done that before, we can do it again.
Well, I have a little bit more business to attend

00:33:18.404 --> 00:33:22.090
"to and then I'll be off my shift and perhaps I'll
join you for drinks."

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.036
LAURA: Party time.

00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:31.797
MATT: "Just a moment. If you wouldn't mind, go
ahead and let Crute know that you've arrived at

00:33:31.797 --> 00:33:34.828
"the Feed &amp;amp; Mead tavern and I'll meet you there in
an hour or so."

00:33:34.828 --> 00:33:35.441
LAURA: Okay.

00:33:35.441 --> 00:33:36.185
SAM: All right.

00:33:36.185 --> 00:33:37.393
MATT: "It's lovely to see you all."

00:33:37.393 --> 00:33:40.900
LAURA: You too! I'm glad you're not in the war
right now!

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:51.207
MATT: "Me too." Bryce turns around and then comes
back. "There's one, your other friend with the–"

00:33:51.207 --> 00:33:52.447
LAURA: Molly.

00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:55.324
MARISHA: Yeah...

00:33:55.324 --> 00:34:03.490
MATT: "Right." At this point they nod their head.
"Say no more. We've all lost our share of loved

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:10.145
"ones. This world can be a dangerous one at times.
I'm sorry for your loss."

00:34:10.145 --> 00:34:12.956
SAM: Thank you for that.

00:34:12.956 --> 00:34:18.157
MATT: "Well, come, I'll meet you soon and we'll
have drinks in his honor."

00:34:18.157 --> 00:34:18.910
SAM: Yes.

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:26.252
MATT: Then Bryce makes their way back inside the
building. You guys are welcome to do anything else

00:34:26.373 --> 00:34:29.879
you wish to prepare for, though it is starting to
get into the evening hours and based on your

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:32.998
previous experience in Alfield, you know this is
one of those towns that primarily shuts down

00:34:32.998 --> 00:34:35.726
post-sunset. This is mostly a farming town.

00:34:35.726 --> 00:34:39.900
TALIESIN: This is a place where you did good.
That's nice.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.537
SAM: Yeah, we did.

00:34:41.537 --> 00:34:43.086
LAURA: It's halves and halvsies, you know?

00:34:43.086 --> 00:34:46.449
TALIESIN: I don't know, everywhere that I've been
with you so far, people seem to be really happy to

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:49.205
see you. It's a sign, in my opinion.

00:34:49.205 --> 00:34:51.275
MARISHA: This might have been the first town we
did good.

00:34:51.275 --> 00:34:52.609
TRAVIS: I think that's right, actually.

00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:54.708
MARISHA: Because we kind of got a guy–

00:34:54.708 --> 00:34:55.722
TRAVIS: Arrested?

00:34:55.722 --> 00:34:57.890
MARISHA: Arrested and thrown in jail for--

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.316
TRAVIS: An indeterminate amount of time.

00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:03.737
LAURA: Yeah, but then we were helping other
people, though, at the same time. So.

00:35:03.737 --> 00:35:10.157
TRAVIS: This was the first one we made a clean,
positive impact, though. Minimal collateral damage.

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:12.156
MARISHA: Came through in the black, not broken
even.

00:35:12.156 --> 00:35:14.110
TRAVIS: No IOUs or you know--

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.716
LAURA: Caleb, do you need to buy paper here or
anything?

00:35:16.716 --> 00:35:18.254
LIAM: No, I am all set.

00:35:18.254 --> 00:35:19.995
LAURA: Okay, just making sure.

00:35:19.995 --> 00:35:22.485
SAM: Let's go to the Feed and the Mead.

00:35:22.485 --> 00:35:28.509
MATT: You guys make your way to the Feed &amp;amp; Mead.
Crute recognizes you as you enter. "It's good to

00:35:28.509 --> 00:35:34.963
"see all of you again. Welcome. Please, sit down. I
will prepare food, I suppose, for many more than I

00:35:34.963 --> 00:35:35.720
"was expecting."

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.979
LAURA: For Bryce too. They're coming.

00:35:38.979 --> 00:35:40.256
MATT: "Good to know."

00:35:40.256 --> 00:35:41.715
LAURA: (gasps)

00:35:41.715 --> 00:35:42.610
SAM: What?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.162
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to open all of the
windows!

00:35:45.162 --> 00:35:51.110
MATT: (crashing) All of the windows slam open
loudly. There's the sound of breaking glass on the

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:56.081
far side as one of the windows is shattered from
the impact. Wind swoops in and you watch as

00:35:56.081 --> 00:36:01.472
Crute-- who's faced away, making the way to the
kitchen-- stops and goes, "(groaning)."

00:36:01.472 --> 00:36:03.241
LAURA: (singing) Memories!

00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:11.801
MATT: Makes his way into the kitchen to finish the
meal. An hour or so passes, a couple other folks

00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:16.774
come in. Some of them don't seem to recognize you
or didn't interface with you directly. A handful

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:24.040
do and they come by and offer to buy a drink.
Crute returns with some basic foods– most

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:31.012
everything here is everything from lightly cooked
vegetables or boiled vegetables to some treated

00:36:31.012 --> 00:36:36.796
and salted meats. They don't have a wide variety
of dishes here, but it is still delicious and very

00:36:36.796 --> 00:36:44.753
classic home-on-the-road food. Bryce eventually
comes and joins you; the first time you've seen

00:36:44.753 --> 00:36:56.454
them out of their formal attire and armor. Bryce
comes in with a light blue soft tunic over some

00:36:56.454 --> 00:37:02.046
light brown leggings and comfortable boots. Very
relaxed and casual as they sit down at the table

00:37:02.046 --> 00:37:13.790
and take an unclaimed tankard and leans back in
the chair. "Well, I think we've all earned this. Cheers."

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.573
SAM, TRAVIS, and LAURA: Cheers!

00:37:15.573 --> 00:37:18.423
MATT: "To friends, here and not."

00:37:20.903 --> 00:37:21.721
LAURA: And Nott!

00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:22.792
MATT: "And Nott."

00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:32.511
SAM: Yes, to me. Any crazy news around here? Or
just the normal stuff?

00:37:32.511 --> 00:37:39.434
MATT: "The normal recovery. Thankfully only one
and a half fields were torched in the gnoll

00:37:39.434 --> 00:37:46.457
"onslaught, so hasn't been a huge detriment to our
farming schedule. Other than that, it's been the

00:37:46.457 --> 00:37:47.840
"Righteous Brand passing through.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:54.394
SAM: The people we rescued from that cave nearby?
Are they all fine, not, you know–?

00:37:54.394 --> 00:38:00.878
MATT: "There's one of them right over there." One
of the individuals that came up and offered to buy

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:04.220
you drinks earlier, you can see it's one of the
older, bearded gentlemen who looks to be a little--

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.004
you recognize him now, once it's pointed out.

00:38:06.004 --> 00:38:07.287
TRAVIS: Totally recognize him now.

00:38:08.457 --> 00:38:13.732
MARISHA: Ey! Yeah!

00:38:13.732 --> 00:38:16.908
MATT: "Ey! Told you they remembered me!"

00:38:16.908 --> 00:38:18.810
MARISHA: Totally know exactly what you're talking
about.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.230
MATT: "They never forget a face, The Mighty
Nein."

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.809
SAM: He was crying when we rescued him.

00:38:27.809 --> 00:38:29.319
LAURA: He was really dirty, covered in a lot of–

00:38:29.319 --> 00:38:32.225
MARISHA: Soot and dirt, yeah.

00:38:32.225 --> 00:38:39.252
MATT: They all do, if you're not paying attention.
Bryce continues on a bit and tells you about how:

00:38:39.252 --> 00:38:48.599
"There's word that the Ashguard Garrison has
fallen. I've been doing the best I can to keep my

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:52.784
"ear to the ground on things happening east. It's
far enough away where no one here's worried, but I

00:38:52.784 --> 00:39:00.456
"have friends in Bladegarden and who were stationed
at the Rockguard, which is the other garrison. If

00:39:00.456 --> 00:39:06.815
"one's fallen. I worry for the other. But I know
they're sending all of their forces that way and--"

00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:07.969
MARISHA: Wait, when did this happen?

00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:13.782
MATT: You did hear about this from one of the town
criers a little over a month ago when you were

00:39:13.782 --> 00:39:15.123
leaving on The Gentleman's errand.

00:39:15.123 --> 00:39:18.158
LAURA: Yes, I remember that very well.

00:39:18.158 --> 00:39:20.801
TRAVIS: Kind of led to the influx of people going
out?

00:39:20.801 --> 00:39:25.733
MARISHA: Yeah, that's when Dairon decided to go,
right? Or was she already out there?

00:39:25.733 --> 00:39:27.905
MATT: Probably. I have to look back at my notes
again.

00:39:27.905 --> 00:39:28.506
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:39:28.506 --> 00:39:31.484
MATT: It's okay. The time period in there-- it's
somewhere in that space.

00:39:31.484 --> 00:39:37.568
LIAM: The trend is that it's pushing closer in.

00:39:37.568 --> 00:39:43.968
MATT: "From what I've heard they've kept it at bay
and there are intents to retake the garrison, but

00:39:43.968 --> 00:39:52.756
"there were well over 2,000 lives lost and I don't
know how much there is specifically to say about,

00:39:52.756 --> 00:39:59.873
"but the rumors are that the sky over that pass,
over the garrison itself, lie as dark as midnight

00:39:59.873 --> 00:40:01.486
"throughout the day even."

00:40:01.486 --> 00:40:05.675
LAURA: Whoa. They've got some serious magic stuff
over there.

00:40:05.675 --> 00:40:06.485
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:40:06.485 --> 00:40:12.510
TRAVIS: Is there any word from the south? We
happen to be heading that way.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:19.549
MATT: "Oh! That makes sense, if you're leaving
Zadash. Well, in times of warfare– and I know

00:40:19.549 --> 00:40:25.258
"we've been notified of this via the information
routes to the rest of the crownsguard and the

00:40:25.258 --> 00:40:29.763
"watchmasters to keep an eye– but I do believe
entrance to the Empire is being very carefully

00:40:29.763 --> 00:40:36.359
"inspected. You shouldn't have an issue leaving –
it's coming back in, during a time of conflict

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:38.511
"like this might take a while.

00:40:40.011 --> 00:40:45.641
SAM: Is there anything that can speed up that
process? Some papers or forms or stamps?

00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:46.376
LIAM: Coin.

00:40:46.376 --> 00:40:47.557
TRAVIS: Global Entry.

00:40:47.557 --> 00:40:53.025
MATT: "I can try and write you something, but,
once again, we're a bit podunk here by comparison.

00:40:53.025 --> 00:40:59.501
"I can't say that those at the Wuyun Gates are
going to be more partial to what I have to say,

00:40:59.501 --> 00:41:00.407
"but I can try."

00:41:00.407 --> 00:41:02.083
TRAVIS: Couldn't hurt.

00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:04.292
LAURA: Do we know anyone else that's important?

00:41:04.292 --> 00:41:06.827
SAM: Here?

00:41:06.827 --> 00:41:07.881
LAURA: Anywhere.

00:41:07.881 --> 00:41:11.746
SAM: We know the Starosta here.

00:41:11.746 --> 00:41:15.993
LAURA: I know the Starosta here. He'd probably
would have some say.

00:41:15.993 --> 00:41:21.840
MATT: "The Starosta here? Yes, but, if I recall,
the last time you spoke wasn't on the most

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.129
"positive terms either."

00:41:23.129 --> 00:41:24.289
LAURA: No, I remember.

00:41:24.289 --> 00:41:32.319
MATT: "Some tricks you may get one shot with. I'd
be worried. He tends--"

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:35.667
LAURA: Maybe I could give back that letter and he
can give us a new letter! Because you don't even

00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:36.781
want it anymore.

00:41:36.781 --> 00:41:48.916
TRAVIS: That's not true, Jester. I still have some
plans for that letter. It does have his signature

00:41:48.916 --> 00:41:50.031
on it, though.

00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:52.037
SAM: So we could just forge another one!

00:41:52.037 --> 00:41:53.409
LAURA: Oh, heck yeah! I'm really good at that.

00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:54.998
MATT: "I haven't heard any of this."

00:41:54.998 --> 00:41:55.804
SAM: Oh, sorry!

00:41:55.804 --> 00:41:59.902
MATT: "No, keep talking, please. Just know that
I've heard nothing," as they put their fingers in

00:41:59.902 --> 00:42:00.480
their ears.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.770
LAURA: Now's the time to do it! There's not a lot
of people here.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:08.285
MATT: "Wait till after I leave, if you don't mind.
You know, protocol."

00:42:08.285 --> 00:42:11.119
TRAVIS: Let them enjoy their drink, please.

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:15.418
MATT: "Exactly. A little plausible deniability
doesn't hurt either."

00:42:15.418 --> 00:42:18.487
MARISHA: How is the Starosta? Is he still a pain
in the ass?

00:42:18.487 --> 00:42:24.378
MATT: "Always, but he does good work and he's
spearheaded organizing many of these

00:42:24.378 --> 00:42:30.910
"reconstruction efforts and maintaining a means of
getting influxes of gold from Rexxentrum. The

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:35.485
"crown has been very good in sending money as
necessary because the Starosta has been so

00:42:35.485 --> 00:42:40.265
"diligent in the connections he has. So, yes, he's
a prick and he's a bit of a pain in the ass on our

00:42:40.265 --> 00:42:45.165
"end, but, I mean, he's not terrible at his job. So
what can I say?"

00:42:45.165 --> 00:42:51.114
LAURA: He's a bit of a prick and what I've heard?
It's not that big of a prick.

00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:55.995
MATT: (singing) "Da da da da da da. I have to work
with him often."

00:42:55.995 --> 00:42:59.813
LAURA: Just from what I heard. I didn't see it
see it, but people talk.

00:42:59.813 --> 00:43:02.984
TRAVIS: Jester, did you often "see it see it"?

00:43:02.984 --> 00:43:04.997
LAURA: Did I often see what what?

00:43:04.997 --> 00:43:05.925
TRAVIS: See it, see it.

00:43:05.925 --> 00:43:12.349
LAURA: Like? Penises? Wieners? I've seen so many
penises.

00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:13.487
TRAVIS: Really?

00:43:13.487 --> 00:43:14.549
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:16.797
MARISHA: What's the best penis you've ever seen?

00:43:16.797 --> 00:43:18.402
LIAM: Wait, hold on, hold on.

00:43:18.402 --> 00:43:21.724
MARISHA: I still want that question answered, but
he can go ahead.

00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:28.875
LIAM: Just a point of clarification, we're talking
voyeuristically because of your household, you mean?

00:43:29.346 --> 00:43:30.998
TRAVIS: Yeah, like you had a peep window or
something.

00:43:30.998 --> 00:43:33.108
MARISHA: What's the matter? Even if she hadn't
seen them voyeuristically--

00:43:33.108 --> 00:43:36.985
LIAM: I just want to understand what we are
talking about. You know, up close is different

00:43:36.985 --> 00:43:38.489
than from behind a boudoir.

00:43:42.709 --> 00:43:52.085
LAURA: I mean, I've seen them mostly not when they
knew that I could see them. If that's what you mean.

00:43:52.085 --> 00:43:54.868
LIAM: I'm curious about your– you.

00:43:54.868 --> 00:43:58.444
MARISHA: Why are you so interested in people's sex
lives, Caleb?

00:43:58.444 --> 00:44:00.087
LAURA: It is true, though. Like, why?

00:44:00.087 --> 00:44:03.265
TRAVIS: Actually, I'm with Beau now. I want to
know your favorite one you've ever seen.

00:44:03.265 --> 00:44:04.685
MARISHA: Yeah, what's your best dick?

00:44:04.685 --> 00:44:06.793
LAURA: My best dick.

00:44:06.793 --> 00:44:07.672
TALIESIN: Pick one.

00:44:07.672 --> 00:44:09.460
SAM: If it's too hard to pick, you can do top
three.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:17.572
LAURA: Okay. Honestly? I saw Molly's when we were
in the bath house.

00:44:17.572 --> 00:44:19.836
MARISHA: Oh!

00:44:19.836 --> 00:44:23.315
SAM: Was it? We must have all seen it, but–

00:44:23.315 --> 00:44:24.477
TRAVIS: Was it tattooed?

00:44:24.477 --> 00:44:25.540
SAM: How did it compare?

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.449
TALIESIN: Reminding everyone that we have all seen
each other naked.

00:44:27.449 --> 00:44:28.949
LAURA: Molly's was pretty good.

00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:33.436
SAM: In terms of just being giant or, like,
well-proportioned? Symmetrical?

00:44:33.436 --> 00:44:35.871
LAURA: It was really nice and it was a good
color.

00:44:35.871 --> 00:44:46.275
LIAM: Only because when I saw it last, it was a
bit of a mess. It was a little bit Egg McMuffin,

00:44:46.275 --> 00:44:47.404
if you know what I'm saying.

00:44:48.994 --> 00:44:52.758
LAURA: Oh, that's right, he did some stuff to it.
No, when it was clean, it was lovely.

00:44:53.988 --> 00:44:56.783
LIAM: Traditional Zadash breakfast.

00:45:00.013 --> 00:45:01.695
MATT: Call that the continental.

00:45:01.715 --> 00:45:05.395
(laughter)

00:45:05.395 --> 00:45:06.228
TALIESIN: Oh, lord.

00:45:06.228 --> 00:45:07.072
LIAM: DPB.

00:45:07.072 --> 00:45:10.493
TALIESIN: I'm feeling very prideful at the moment.
Thank you.

00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:19.178
MATT: Bryce at this point goes, "Well, folks, I
think this is my cue to get some rest. It's been

00:45:19.178 --> 00:45:22.000
"great catching up a bit with all of you. Stay
safe."

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.557
TRAVIS: You as well, yes. We wish you nothing but
the best.

00:45:24.557 --> 00:45:25.183
MATT: "You as well."

00:45:25.183 --> 00:45:25.894
LAURA: Cheers again!

00:45:25.894 --> 00:45:30.979
MATT: "Cheers again. If ever you find your way
near this podunk side of the Empire again, you'll

00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:37.839
"always have a place to stay in Alfield. Heck,
maybe if all this business to the east is finished

00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:41.947
"before long, and I get some time off, maybe I'll
come visit you up in Zadash."

00:45:41.947 --> 00:45:42.941
LAURA: You should.

00:45:42.941 --> 00:45:43.918
MATT: "It's been a while."

00:45:43.918 --> 00:45:46.778
LAURA: You should come visit us over in the
Menagerie Coast.

00:45:46.778 --> 00:45:49.521
MATT: "I haven't been there since I was a child."

00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:52.708
LAURA: Just leave!

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:55.224
SAM: Just leave your post! Go AWOL! Come with us!

00:45:55.224 --> 00:45:58.142
MATT: "There's too many people here that depend on
me. I can't."

00:45:58.142 --> 00:45:59.667
LAURA: Okay, you're a good person.

00:45:59.667 --> 00:46:00.599
SAM: You're such a good--

00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:02.433
TRAVIS: You're a good person.

00:46:02.433 --> 00:46:03.762
LIAM: Ja, but still.

00:46:03.762 --> 00:46:09.127
MATT: "I appreciate that." They stand up leave a
few coins on the table.

00:46:09.127 --> 00:46:15.794
SAM: Oh, no, we got this one! This one's on us.
Your money's no good here! I'll fucking kill you

00:46:15.794 --> 00:46:16.981
if you try to pay!

00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:24.238
MATT: "Right, okay! All right!" They take the
coins, finish the drink, walk over to the bar, and

00:46:24.238 --> 00:46:29.092
set them on the counter anyway, and then walk
away. "Good night."

00:46:29.092 --> 00:46:30.115
SAM: Good night.

00:46:30.115 --> 00:46:31.581
MATT: And they walk away.

00:46:34.311 --> 00:46:40.777
TRAVIS: That was an escalation, Nott. I feel like
one, two, and then just nine.

00:46:40.777 --> 00:46:42.070
MARISHA: Did we scare them away?

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:46.906
SAM: I don't want to feel like a burden on anyone,
you know?

00:46:46.906 --> 00:46:53.919
LIAM: Here's a question. Once we get to the
Menagerie Coast, I feel like we'll have a good

00:46:53.919 --> 00:47:00.709
sense of how Nott is at fitting in. What is it
like for--

00:47:00.709 --> 00:47:01.537
SAM: Oh, yes.

00:47:01.537 --> 00:47:05.712
LAURA: Honestly, I've never seen any goblins
there.

00:47:05.712 --> 00:47:08.108
TRAVIS: I haven't either.

00:47:08.108 --> 00:47:14.377
SAM: Well, I can wear my mask, and I got these
lovely gloves.

00:47:14.377 --> 00:47:16.247
LAURA: These are so creepy.

00:47:16.247 --> 00:47:20.004
SAM: What? What are you talking about? They look
like real fingers.

00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:21.389
LAURA: Ew.

00:47:21.389 --> 00:47:23.291
LIAM: It's also hot. Is it hot there?

00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:24.151
TRAVIS: It's a bit warmer.

00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:25.299
LAURA: It's warmer. It's nice.

00:47:25.299 --> 00:47:26.354
TRAVIS: A little humidity, yeah.

00:47:26.354 --> 00:47:28.772
LIAM: You might not want mittens, you know?

00:47:28.772 --> 00:47:30.452
LAURA: Skin mittens.

00:47:30.452 --> 00:47:33.594
SAM: I'll see how long I last.

00:47:33.594 --> 00:47:37.711
TRAVIS: Leave them on, you cook your fingers in
some balsamic, it'll be great. Smell real nice

00:47:37.711 --> 00:47:38.676
when you pull them out.

00:47:38.676 --> 00:47:41.971
SAM: I don't smell good to begin with.

00:47:41.971 --> 00:47:43.072
TRAVIS: Like a cast.

00:47:43.072 --> 00:47:44.084
MARISHA: Oh god.

00:47:44.084 --> 00:47:47.165
TRAVIS: You get that cast off, you're like (sniffs
deeply).

00:47:47.165 --> 00:47:49.290
LIAM: You're fine when you're next to me.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:51.559
SAM: It's true. Stink-ouflage.

00:47:51.559 --> 00:47:54.727
LIAM: That old chestnut.

00:47:54.727 --> 00:47:56.926
LAURA: Should we sleep here?

00:47:56.926 --> 00:47:58.674
SAM: We have to sleep here, it's nighttime.

00:47:58.674 --> 00:47:59.729
TRAVIS and MATT: Yeah.

00:47:59.729 --> 00:48:03.246
LAURA: Well, all right, didn't know if we wanted
to sleep in the bubble, but, you know--

00:48:03.246 --> 00:48:06.097
LIAM: No, a roof is good. Let's have a roof.

00:48:06.097 --> 00:48:10.692
TRAVIS: Did they say where we were going to be put
up, our lodging?

00:48:10.692 --> 00:48:11.272
LAURA: Here.

00:48:11.272 --> 00:48:12.051
MATT: Here, yeah.

00:48:12.051 --> 00:48:12.879
TRAVIS: Oh, where we are?

00:48:12.879 --> 00:48:14.968
LIAM: It's easy. We stumble upstairs.

00:48:14.968 --> 00:48:24.135
MATT: Yeah, the room is already provided. Your
delightfully pleasant evening purveyor of down

00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:32.576
pillows and blankets, Crute, is ever eager to show
you where you can leave him the fuck alone. You

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:36.771
manage to find your rooms and rest for the
evening. The following morning, you gather your

00:48:37.011 --> 00:48:38.502
things, the cart has been taken care of.

00:48:38.502 --> 00:48:43.042
LAURA: Could I have, before we went to sleep, sent
a message to my mama, letting her know we might be

00:48:43.042 --> 00:48:43.803
passing through?

00:48:43.803 --> 00:48:44.727
MATT: Indeed, you can.

00:48:44.727 --> 00:48:45.372
LAURA: Okay.

00:48:45.372 --> 00:48:52.513
MATT: All right. In the morning, breakfast is
provided for you. There are a few folks that are

00:48:52.513 --> 00:48:56.512
in here finishing their breakfast before going out
in the fields, going about their daily business,

00:48:56.512 --> 00:49:00.958
and, as you descend to your breakfast meal, you
watch half the room go quiet as they all watch

00:49:00.958 --> 00:49:07.000
you. Throughout the rest of the meal, they lock
eyes in a very "I don't know how to act" kind of a

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.785
way, but not in a bad way. Pardon. Some of you
especially aren't used to being the person that

00:49:12.785 --> 00:49:17.063
walks into a room and being stared at, but the
energy is different here. There's definitely more

00:49:17.063 --> 00:49:19.373
of a reverence. It's kind of a nice change of
pace.

00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:20.573
LIAM: Morgen.

00:49:20.573 --> 00:49:23.746
LAURA: What did you say? Morgen?

00:49:23.746 --> 00:49:29.334
SAM: It's Zemnian for "good morning."

00:49:29.334 --> 00:49:30.778
LAURA: Morgen.

00:49:30.778 --> 00:49:34.894
LIAM: Ja, morgen. Guten morgen.

00:49:34.894 --> 00:49:36.943
LAURA: How do I say, "I would like some pastries,
please?"

00:49:36.943 --> 00:49:39.767
LIAM: Liam does not know.

00:49:39.767 --> 00:49:44.880
SAM: It's too complicated to teach. The accent is
very difficult.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:45.620
LAURA: Oh.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.475
MATT: Some of the Zemnian Critters out there will
tweet you the pronunciation.

00:49:49.475 --> 00:49:52.247
LIAM: Liefen, laufen, loafen, loben.

00:49:52.247 --> 00:49:54.814
SAM: That's actually very close. That's kind of
close. Yeah.

00:49:56.424 --> 00:49:57.168
MARISHA: Question.

00:49:57.168 --> 00:49:57.882
MATT: Yes?

00:49:57.882 --> 00:50:01.975
MARISHA: What was the name of the town that Gustav
is stuck at?

00:50:01.975 --> 00:50:04.461
MATT: Trostenwald. That's the next one on your
trip.

00:50:04.461 --> 00:50:05.459
MARISHA: It's the next one.

00:50:05.459 --> 00:50:07.000
MATT: It's the final town to the south.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.860
MARISHA: We're in Alfield. That's where I stole
mail. Okay, I was getting confused if we were in--

00:50:11.462 --> 00:50:16.719
Okay. Cool. Do you guys want to stop in down in
Trostenwald on our way?

00:50:16.719 --> 00:50:17.935
SAM: It's on the way, yeah.

00:50:17.935 --> 00:50:25.683
MARISHA: You know, we have a little bit more money
now, maybe we could help Gustav out a little bit.

00:50:25.683 --> 00:50:27.654
The last good thing that we could do.

00:50:27.654 --> 00:50:33.266
LIAM: Also, the nostalgia factor of seeing where
we all, you know, got hitched.

00:50:33.266 --> 00:50:35.759
MARISHA: I'm sure he would also like to know about
Molly.

00:50:35.759 --> 00:50:40.750
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah, that's a good point. We
should make a stop.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:47.013
MARISHA: You know, I never really thought about
the fact that when you're with someone when they

00:50:47.013 --> 00:50:54.537
die, it's kind of your responsibility for forever
to tell anyone who doesn't know what happened.

00:50:54.537 --> 00:50:56.426
TRAVIS: Yep. Never goes away.

00:50:56.426 --> 00:51:02.008
MARISHA: That kind of sucks. So let's keep sharing
bad news.

00:51:02.008 --> 00:51:08.790
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, hey, after we pass
Trostenwald, we'll get a break from that shit for

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:09.939
a while.

00:51:09.939 --> 00:51:10.691
MARISHA: That's true.

00:51:10.691 --> 00:51:12.638
LAURA: It's really pretty, the ocean.

00:51:12.638 --> 00:51:14.271
LIAM: Have you ever been out of Empire?

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:17.184
MARISHA: No, furthest south I've been, I think, is
Trostenwald.

00:51:17.184 --> 00:51:17.746
LIAM: Same.

00:51:17.746 --> 00:51:18.920
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:25.857
LAURA: The water is really blue. I think you guys
will like it. Yes, Nott, even you.

00:51:25.857 --> 00:51:27.651
SAM: Nope, no thanks.

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.498
MARISHA: You could continue your swimming
lessons.

00:51:29.498 --> 00:51:32.520
LAURA: It's really blue, and it smells like fish!

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.061
SAM: That's nice. I like fish.

00:51:35.061 --> 00:51:37.732
TRAVIS: Salt on the wind, it's amazing.

00:51:37.732 --> 00:51:40.213
SAM: All right, let's go see it.

00:51:40.213 --> 00:51:41.972
TALIESIN: This sounds exciting.

00:51:41.972 --> 00:51:45.994
(laughter)

00:51:45.994 --> 00:51:49.408
MATT: All right, you guys gather your things back
up into the cart. It's been brought around front.

00:51:49.408 --> 00:51:55.228
You get your horses ready for the next leg of your
journey. If you want to collect feed for the

00:51:55.228 --> 00:51:59.016
horses along the way, since you've been traveling
for a few days, if someone wants to mark off--

00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:00.292
MARISHA: Sure, let's just do that.

00:52:00.292 --> 00:52:02.292
MATT: I'll say another gold worth of feed that
you--

00:52:02.292 --> 00:52:03.726
LIAM: I will pay for that.

00:52:03.726 --> 00:52:05.576
SAM: No, Caleb, save your gold for paper.

00:52:05.576 --> 00:52:07.760
LIAM: It's done and done, it's already happened.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.635
SAM: Or incense.

00:52:08.635 --> 00:52:16.491
LIAM: I'm good. I've stocked up. I am plush. I
have more coin in my pocket than I ever could have

00:52:16.491 --> 00:52:19.138
imagined, and I have already spent most of what we
made.

00:52:19.138 --> 00:52:19.809
MATT: All right.

00:52:19.809 --> 00:52:21.146
SAM: Do you want some more?

00:52:21.146 --> 00:52:22.645
LIAM: No.

00:52:22.645 --> 00:52:24.433
SAM: Just a little mad money or anything?

00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:25.933
TRAVIS: You know, I want some more.

00:52:25.933 --> 00:52:27.343
LIAM: No, I'm good.

00:52:27.343 --> 00:52:32.505
MATT: All right, continuing south, Caleb, are you
maintaining your position on the cart?

00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:33.020
LIAM: Ja.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:33.725
MATT: Okay.

00:52:33.725 --> 00:52:38.102
TRAVIS: I'll give my position up to Caduceus or
Jester, either one.

00:52:38.102 --> 00:52:39.547
LAURA: I'll ride with Caduceus.

00:52:39.547 --> 00:52:40.287
TALIESIN: All right.

00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:41.096
LAURA: I'll help you.

00:52:41.096 --> 00:52:41.819
TALIESIN: Yeah, it'll be fun.

00:52:41.819 --> 00:52:42.763
LIAM: Oh, you two take it, then.

00:52:42.763 --> 00:52:43.293
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:47.956
MATT: All right. Caleb takes a break at the back
as Caduceus makes his way to the front of the

00:52:47.956 --> 00:52:54.402
cart, grabs the reins. Jester, you go ahead and
plop alongside. You eventually turn your way

00:52:54.402 --> 00:52:55.536
heading westward.

00:52:55.536 --> 00:52:57.564
TALIESIN: I don't think I've done this before.

00:52:57.564 --> 00:52:58.669
LAURA: You're good with animals, though.

00:52:58.669 --> 00:53:02.770
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, no, you just got to ask
permission before you do anything.

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:03.672
MATT: Which you can do.

00:53:03.672 --> 00:53:10.627
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. I ask permission to any animal
I interact with, anything I eat, and it's always a conversation.

00:53:10.902 --> 00:53:12.665
TRAVIS: You ask permission to ride the horse?

00:53:12.665 --> 00:53:16.738
TALIESIN: Yeah. I say we're going to be-- Well, I
explain to the horse that we're going to be moving

00:53:16.738 --> 00:53:23.271
south and I'd really appreciate their cooperation
in the process, and how long we expect to be going for.

00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:24.403
TRAVIS: Out loud, do you do this?

00:53:24.403 --> 00:53:26.145
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:53:26.145 --> 00:53:29.091
TRAVIS: All right, just checking. I didn't know if
you had some mumbo jumbo.

00:53:29.091 --> 00:53:35.429
TALIESIN: I mean, can you do it without-- Can you
talk without talking, is that a thing you can do?

00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:39.652
TRAVIS: (mumbling) I don't think so. Am I
talking?

00:53:39.652 --> 00:53:48.267
TALIESIN: I can hear you, but your lips aren't
moving. This is-- nope, it's not working for me.

00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:56.118
Nope. Probably take ten minutes actually trying to
do that before we get going.

00:53:56.118 --> 00:53:59.236
MATT: Okay, but you go ahead and ask permission of
the horses.

00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:01.100
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:05.103
MATT: You watch as Caduceus comes and quietly
talks to each of the horses, and it seems

00:54:05.103 --> 00:54:13.364
ridiculous at first, but as he finishes talking to
the horse, the horse nudges alongside him and

00:54:13.364 --> 00:54:16.308
gives a hoof clop on the ground.

00:54:16.308 --> 00:54:18.284
TRAVIS: You're a seven-foot Bob Ross, I love it.

00:54:18.284 --> 00:54:19.569
TALIESIN: Manners will get you everywhere.

00:54:19.569 --> 00:54:21.677
LAURA: (gasps) Manners.

00:54:21.677 --> 00:54:27.803
MATT: With that, Caduceus gets up onto the cart
next to Jester, pulls on the reins, and with that,

00:54:27.803 --> 00:54:30.834
you guys begin to make your exit from Alfield a
second time.

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:36.853
LAURA: (singing) Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
how I wonder what you are.

00:54:36.853 --> 00:54:38.939
MARISHA: What? You're really good!

00:54:38.939 --> 00:54:42.230
TALIESIN: That's some black magic right there.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.540
LAURA: (laughs) I do that for way too long on the
road.

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.245
TRAVIS: You sacrifice Ronin to be able to do
that.

00:54:47.245 --> 00:54:49.668
(laughter)

00:54:49.668 --> 00:54:53.574
TALIESIN: That's really impressive, and you sound
like a kid that fell down the well when you're

00:54:53.574 --> 00:54:54.231
doing that.

00:54:54.231 --> 00:54:58.520
MATT: I don't know if you can just now do that, or
if you've always been able to do that, and then

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.844
Ronin's your eventual payment of the contract.

00:55:01.844 --> 00:55:04.330
MARISHA: Firstborn.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:09.016
MATT: I know, exactly. As you guys are exiting
Alfield, a few more folks come out to the street

00:55:09.016 --> 00:55:18.112
to watch you leave. Some faces familiar: a child,
a woman, people that you recognize as individuals

00:55:18.112 --> 00:55:23.585
you had helped make their way out of the mines
long ago, and you see them wave, and they all say, "Goodbye."

00:55:23.601 --> 00:55:25.143
LAURA: Bye!

00:55:25.143 --> 00:55:30.024
MATT: A kid quietly raises a hand, smiling, too
shy to say anything, and with that, you make your

00:55:30.024 --> 00:55:33.617
way past the final buildings, out of Alfield and
back onto the road south.

00:55:33.617 --> 00:55:36.632
LAURA: Aw man, we saved their lives. That's pretty
cool.

00:55:36.632 --> 00:55:38.068
SAM: We're awesome, yeah.

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:43.348
MATT: Two days' travel to Trostenwald from
Alfield, so which one of you wants to helm the

00:55:43.348 --> 00:55:44.572
first watch?

00:55:44.572 --> 00:55:46.768
TALIESIN: I'll take first watch.

00:55:46.768 --> 00:55:48.087
LAURA: Oh, yeah, I was going to help him.

00:55:48.087 --> 00:55:50.376
MATT: All right, so roll with advantage on your
perception check, please.

00:55:50.376 --> 00:55:51.906
TALIESIN: All right.

00:55:52.906 --> 00:55:53.668
LAURA: Whoa!

00:55:53.668 --> 00:55:59.675
TALIESIN: Yeah, nothing gets by me, unless I--
Well, no, that's a natural 20.

00:55:59.675 --> 00:56:04.220
TRAVIS: Ho! Boom-shaka-laka-laka!

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.157
LAURA: I'm going to say that's my help. That's me
helping.

00:56:06.157 --> 00:56:14.526
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, you're just pointing at
things. Got it, got it. Yep, got that. Yep, oh,

00:56:14.526 --> 00:56:18.032
got that. Got that, yep. Where? Yeah.

00:56:18.032 --> 00:56:24.656
MATT: Towards the end of the first day's travel,
around what would be roughly 5:00, 5:30 in the

00:56:24.656 --> 00:56:30.096
afternoon, as you're keeping an eye out, you
glance over what looks to be-- and you do find a

00:56:30.422 --> 00:56:36.971
few clusters of stone and rock that break up the
rolling hills and tall grass that make up a large

00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:41.234
part of the southern part of the Marrow Valley
that you're used to. You, who come from a very

00:56:41.234 --> 00:56:45.812
northern, borderline tundra north of the
Savalierwood--

00:56:45.812 --> 00:56:48.369
TALIESIN: It's tundra, except for my little
patch.

00:56:48.369 --> 00:56:56.593
MATT: Yeah, taiga in places. You can see this very
green and open field is a whole new experience to

00:56:56.593 --> 00:57:01.681
you, and you're enjoying the details of it as you
pass by: the field mice that occasionally scurry

00:57:01.681 --> 00:57:08.289
across the road and get snatched up by a hawk, and
you're like, yep, that's how it happens.

00:57:08.289 --> 00:57:09.106
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:57:09.106 --> 00:57:10.040
TALIESIN: Fair play.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.134
TRAVIS: Careful crossing the-- (cawing).

00:57:13.134 --> 00:57:17.922
MATT: As you're glancing about, you can see a lot
of these natural stones placed, and you see one

00:57:17.922 --> 00:57:23.337
cluster of stones that doesn't look naturally
placed; they're leaned at an odd angle. If it had

00:57:23.337 --> 00:57:27.333
been placed at, or if it had been at that angle
for a while, it would've eventually settled.

00:57:27.333 --> 00:57:29.399
TALIESIN: That doesn't look right.

00:57:29.399 --> 00:57:30.575
LAURA: What doesn't?

00:57:30.575 --> 00:57:31.449
TALIESIN: That.

00:57:31.449 --> 00:57:33.388
LAURA: The field?

00:57:33.388 --> 00:57:40.773
TALIESIN: Now, if I were inclined to be a trap or
an ambush of some kind, or-- Those rocks shouldn't

00:57:40.773 --> 00:57:42.430
be that way, that's all I'm saying.

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:47.074
MATT: As you glance over, you can see three
stones, and one of them is about this big, it's a

00:57:47.074 --> 00:57:51.730
pretty heavy stone, and two longer slab stones,
and they're all leaned against each other to look

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:55.147
natural, but Caduceus doesn't seem to feel that
way.

00:57:55.147 --> 00:57:59.652
LAURA: Maybe somebody is sitting in the little
alcove.

00:57:59.652 --> 00:58:03.522
TALIESIN: It's giving me the bad feelings.

00:58:03.522 --> 00:58:05.087
LAURA: Should we go attack it?!

00:58:05.087 --> 00:58:06.219
TALIESIN: The rocks?

00:58:06.219 --> 00:58:07.557
LAURA: I don't know.

00:58:07.557 --> 00:58:09.836
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm okay if you are.

00:58:09.836 --> 00:58:12.461
LAURA: Do you want to, like--

00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:14.162
TALIESIN: Never had a rock really hit back.

00:58:14.162 --> 00:58:16.194
LAURA: I hop off the cart and, like--

00:58:16.194 --> 00:58:17.179
SAM: Where are you going?

00:58:17.179 --> 00:58:18.344
LAURA: How far away is it?

00:58:18.344 --> 00:58:22.066
MATT: It's about, from where you are now, as
you've traveled closer, it's about 80 to 100 feet

00:58:22.066 --> 00:58:23.446
to the left off the road.

00:58:23.446 --> 00:58:24.658
LIAM: Where are you going?

00:58:24.658 --> 00:58:27.325
LAURA: I'm going to throw a little rock as hard as
I can towards it.

00:58:27.325 --> 00:58:28.358
MATT: Make a strength check.

00:58:28.358 --> 00:58:30.791
LAURA: Please be a good strength check.

00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:32.655
TALIESIN: This looks a little weird to me.

00:58:32.655 --> 00:58:33.520
LAURA: That's not good.

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.927
TALIESIN: It's my mime.

00:58:34.927 --> 00:58:36.052
LAURA: That's 11.

00:58:36.052 --> 00:58:43.607
MATT: 11. It arcs, falls maybe about ten feet
short in the grass. No reaction.

00:58:43.607 --> 00:58:48.871
TALIESIN: I'm going to use "Thaumagurgy" to cast
my voice very loudly behind the other side of the

00:58:48.871 --> 00:58:50.836
rocks. Thaumaturgy, it just got stuck in there.

00:58:50.836 --> 00:58:52.634
SAM: Thauma-gurgy.

00:58:52.634 --> 00:58:55.563
TALIESIN: Thauma-gurgy! I want to use my
Thauma-gerchy.

00:58:55.563 --> 00:59:00.624
MATT: Okay, so as far as Thaumaturgy, you can't
throw your voice so much as you can amplify

00:59:00.624 --> 00:59:01.365
the volume.

00:59:01.365 --> 00:59:03.548
TALIESIN: Oh, so I can't throw my voice, then.

00:59:03.548 --> 00:59:07.571
MATT: I'll say you can throw it a little bit. You
can't flank it, per se, but you can give it a

00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:09.544
little more of a force from one side, I'll say.

00:59:09.544 --> 00:59:11.648
TALIESIN: Hang on a second, I can do tremors in
the ground.

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:12.406
MATT: Yeah, if you want.

00:59:12.406 --> 00:59:20.139
TALIESIN: So I'm going to start tremoring the
ground right over by those rocks.

00:59:20.139 --> 00:59:29.097
MATT: Okay. It shakes a bit, and you can see some
bits of loose rock on top of this weird stone

00:59:29.097 --> 00:59:35.626
construct begin to vibrate, fall off the side. No
reaction.

00:59:35.626 --> 00:59:37.409
LAURA: Maybe somebody's buried there.

00:59:40.639 --> 00:59:43.048
LIAM: I poke my head between them. What are you
doing?

00:59:43.048 --> 00:59:43.872
SAM: What's going on?

00:59:43.872 --> 00:59:44.523
LAURA: I don't know.

00:59:44.523 --> 00:59:45.647
TALIESIN: The rocks look a little weird, I don't
know.

00:59:45.647 --> 00:59:47.153
SAM: The rocks look weird? What does that mean?

00:59:47.153 --> 00:59:49.200
TALIESIN: It means the rocks look weird.

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.576
TRAVIS: They giving you a bad feeling?

00:59:50.576 --> 00:59:52.796
TALIESIN: They're giving me a bad feeling. I don't
have a lot of bad feelings.

00:59:52.796 --> 00:59:53.962
TRAVIS: Let's go check it out.

00:59:53.962 --> 00:59:55.192
TALIESIN: All right.

00:59:55.192 --> 00:59:56.449
MARISHA: Maybe they're a trail marker.

00:59:56.449 --> 01:00:02.598
TALIESIN: Maybe. It's an awfully suspicious trail
marker. If it was a trail marker, you usually

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:08.453
stack three stones, make it look very intentional.
Have you ever seen a painting where someone tries

01:00:08.453 --> 01:00:13.626
to paint stars, but the stars don't look right,
because they're the wrong kind of random? That's

01:00:13.626 --> 01:00:14.852
the wrong kind of random.

01:00:14.852 --> 01:00:17.007
LIAM: I send Frumpkin to go look at the rocks.

01:00:17.007 --> 01:00:19.159
LAURA: Maybe it's a secret entrance to something!

01:00:19.159 --> 01:00:23.565
MATT: The rest of you keep looking at this pile of
stones, and it just looks like a pile of stones.

01:00:23.565 --> 01:00:32.086
You're like, "Really?" So Frumpkin's heading up?
(meowing) Frumpkin gets low to the grass--

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:34.484
TALIESIN: The random nature makes and the random
that man makes.

01:00:34.484 --> 01:00:36.008
MATT: Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:39.523
LIAM: Ten.

01:00:39.523 --> 01:00:46.867
MATT: Frumpkin does a little pass around the side,
and there doesn't appear to be anybody in or

01:00:46.867 --> 01:00:48.811
around them, from what Frumpkin can see.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.417
TALIESIN: All right, let's go take a look, then.

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:51.627
MARISHA: Let's go knock them over.

01:00:51.627 --> 01:00:53.089
LIAM: Can he climb to the tippy-top?

01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:58.364
MATT: Sure. Frumpkin leaps onto the top and
perches up there. (meowing)

01:00:58.364 --> 01:00:59.896
LIAM: I'm looking down at us.

01:00:59.896 --> 01:01:10.000
MATT: It's a strange view to see yourself walking
towards yourself. It's like playing Resident Evil

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.177
1, where you have the locked camera.

01:01:13.177 --> 01:01:16.254
LIAM: Turn around!

01:01:16.254 --> 01:01:22.018
MATT: That's technically how Shakäste sees the
world, when you think about it. It's all of

01:01:22.018 --> 01:01:26.845
existence through a series of Resident Evil camera
angles. The Duchess, man.

01:01:26.845 --> 01:01:29.001
TALIESIN: That makes me a little sad, on a
fundamental level.

01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:30.539
MATT: Well, he can turn a lot better.

01:01:30.539 --> 01:01:33.001
TRAVIS: Getting in between the two angles and
having to go back and forth?

01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:35.904
TALIESIN: No left, right, left, right, ugh!

01:01:35.904 --> 01:01:40.882
LIAM: Having to do K turns as a person is rough.

01:01:40.882 --> 01:01:50.107
MATT: You all slowly approach this strange pile of
rocks settled here.

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:51.076
TRAVIS: Trees above us?

01:01:51.076 --> 01:01:56.983
MATT: No, it's an open field. There are some trees
maybe 300, 400 feet off. This part of the field,

01:01:56.983 --> 01:02:01.684
they're small clusters, four or five at a time.
It's mostly open, rolling hills.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:05.036
MARISHA: Are we near where the gnoll mine was?

01:02:05.036 --> 01:02:09.413
MATT: No, you're days away. That was east of the
city. You guys are heading south.

01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:10.965
LAURA: Did you say how tall the rocks are?

01:02:10.965 --> 01:02:14.126
MATT: All together, probably about four feet
tall.

01:02:14.126 --> 01:02:18.613
LIAM: Does it look like there is anything buried,
any digging done here?

01:02:18.613 --> 01:02:20.260
MATT: Make an investigation check, if you want
to.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.447
LIAM: 20.

01:02:23.447 --> 01:02:26.273
MATT: As you get down inside--

01:02:26.273 --> 01:02:27.752
LIAM: Sorry. 25.

01:02:27.752 --> 01:02:33.184
MATT: Okay, 25. As you get down to the stones,
there's the one larger central stone and there are

01:02:33.184 --> 01:02:37.938
the two ones laid against it. There's a very small
space in between there, and you get inside and

01:02:37.938 --> 01:02:42.182
begin to look around the ground, and you feel
down, and there's nothing. It's mainly dirt and

01:02:42.182 --> 01:02:47.247
dry brush and dead grass that's been pushed in
that centerpiece. You reach up, and your hand

01:02:47.247 --> 01:02:48.161
touches something.

01:02:48.161 --> 01:02:49.862
LAURA: (whispering) Treasure!

01:02:49.862 --> 01:02:54.079
MATT: It feels like a satchel, or a leather sack.

01:02:54.079 --> 01:02:56.809
SAM: What do you have?

01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:58.023
LIAM: That's a bingo.

01:02:58.023 --> 01:02:59.561
SAM: Do you need me to come?

01:02:59.561 --> 01:03:01.260
TRAVIS: It's just bingo, Caleb.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.627
LAURA: Did you find some paper?

01:03:03.627 --> 01:03:05.607
SAM: Do you need me to touch it to disarm it?

01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:12.019
LIAM: Hold on. I send Frumpkin to get down by my
hand to look up so that I can look at what I'm

01:03:12.019 --> 01:03:15.889
grabbing, to make sure that it is not one of those
bags with teeth or something that I have read

01:03:15.889 --> 01:03:17.648
about in fairytale stories.

01:03:17.648 --> 01:03:20.373
MARISHA: Oh, we found a few of those bags.

01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:23.934
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:26.432
LIAM: One moment!

01:03:26.432 --> 01:03:29.270
LAURA: Caleb, Caleb, Caleb! What did you find,
Caleb?

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.975
LIAM: Some loot. Maybe.

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:31.879
LAURA: Pull it out!

01:03:31.879 --> 01:03:33.860
MARISHA: What if it's a trap?

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.167
LIAM: No, first Frumpkin goes to look, so I can
see what I'm seeing.

01:03:37.167 --> 01:03:38.658
LAURA: Why don't you let Nott look?

01:03:38.658 --> 01:03:45.302
MATT: Frumpkin crawls inside and looks up, and
there is, indeed, a leather pouch, roughly the

01:03:45.302 --> 01:03:50.610
size of a baseball, that has been jammed up
between the rocks to the point where it's being

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.380
held up underneath out of sight.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.624
LAURA: Is there poop in it?

01:03:54.624 --> 01:03:56.612
SAM: Pull it out! See what we've got!

01:03:56.612 --> 01:03:58.928
LIAM: I don't like all these euphemisms. I pull
the bag out.

01:03:58.928 --> 01:04:03.460
MATT: Okay. As you pull the bag out from the
rock... it comes free.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.585
TRAVIS: Good fake out. I like it. Textbook.

01:04:07.585 --> 01:04:09.183
LAURA: Open it up!

01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:10.519
TRAVIS: Now you die.

01:04:10.519 --> 01:04:15.579
MATT: As you open the bag... it's fine.

01:04:15.579 --> 01:04:18.554
TRAVIS: Too many. Two times!

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:25.824
MATT: I don't know, let me have my little fun. You
open inside, and you already hear the impact of a

01:04:25.824 --> 01:04:32.794
bunch of tiny stones and as you look inside, there
are gems in here. It is a collection of cut jewels.

01:04:33.032 --> 01:04:34.774
LAURA: Diamonds? Are there diamonds?

01:04:34.774 --> 01:04:42.690
MATT: It's mostly emerald and ruby. There's a lot
of them, and they're jammed up in here. You get

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:48.579
the sense immediately that this was a drop spot.
Someone will probably be coming by to try and pick

01:04:48.579 --> 01:04:49.267
this up.

01:04:49.267 --> 01:04:50.803
LAURA: Somebody's going to be so pissed!

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:56.220
LIAM: Caleb takes the bag and he puts it in
Jester's hand, and starts to quietly dance around.

01:04:56.791 --> 01:05:03.785
LAURA: (singing) We got lots of jewels here! They
are so pretty! We should get in the cart and drive

01:05:03.785 --> 01:05:04.853
away really fast.

01:05:04.853 --> 01:05:12.569
SAM: That's fine, but give me a second. We should
make sure there's no tracks. We clear all the

01:05:12.569 --> 01:05:13.521
tracks away.

01:05:13.521 --> 01:05:17.023
LAURA: I'm going to empty the jewels out and--

01:05:17.023 --> 01:05:22.535
SAM: Oh, so they're not in that bag? Yeah, let's
replace them with other rocks and put them in.

01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:27.208
TRAVIS: Jester, if somebody left jewels for
somebody else to pick up, and it's full of rocks,

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:28.603
you might get that person killed.

01:05:28.603 --> 01:05:30.180
SAM: Yeah, but it's not us!

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:36.235
LAURA: Let's put a bunch of rocks in it! It's
fine. They're not going to die.

01:05:36.235 --> 01:05:43.432
SAM: We're not all good yet; we're trying to do
good. There's gray in the middle.

01:05:43.432 --> 01:05:48.201
LAURA: They'll probably open the bag before they
deliver it, you know? Then they'll see it.

01:05:48.201 --> 01:05:53.735
LIAM: I take one gem and say: This is a six-foot
tall stack of paper! We're taking them!

01:05:53.735 --> 01:05:56.615
LAURA: Rocks, rocks, rocks.

01:05:56.615 --> 01:06:00.724
MATT: Okay. You fill the small leather sack with
rocks.

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:04.472
LAURA: And one little piece of dried poo that I
found that was an animal's.

01:06:04.472 --> 01:06:06.226
LIAM: Did you find it in your pants?

01:06:06.226 --> 01:06:08.477
LAURA: You got to know where to look.

01:06:08.477 --> 01:06:09.825
MATT: Follow your nose.

01:06:09.825 --> 01:06:17.828
SAM: Should we leave a note throwing them off our
track? Like, "Oh, you know who took this? Fuck

01:06:17.828 --> 01:06:21.703
"you! Love, The Iron Shepherds," or something like
that.

01:06:21.703 --> 01:06:24.919
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. You thought you were getting
jewels, but you're getting rocks and shit!

01:06:24.919 --> 01:06:27.674
LAURA: And poop! Dried poop! Yeah, I'll write
that.

01:06:27.674 --> 01:06:28.871
TRAVIS: Love, The Iron Shepherds.

01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:39.546
LIAM: While everybody's arguing, I'm going to sit
down and Detect Magic as a ritual.

01:06:39.546 --> 01:06:45.963
MATT: That's a ten minute casting time to cast as
a ritual? Okay.

01:06:45.963 --> 01:06:55.872
SAM: I'm going to start going around and trying to
mess up our tracks, maybe leave a few deeper

01:06:55.872 --> 01:06:57.806
footprints walking the other way?

01:06:57.806 --> 01:06:59.199
MATT: Make a survival check.

01:06:59.199 --> 01:07:04.738
SAM: Oh, boy. 19. Naturally.

01:07:04.738 --> 01:07:07.777
MATT: Nice. I believe it's wisdom?

01:07:07.777 --> 01:07:12.610
SAM: Plus zero. I'm better with other things.

01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:19.242
MATT: That's true, yeah. It's not charisma,
thankfully. You feel pretty confident that you've

01:07:19.242 --> 01:07:26.027
managed to erase most any sign of any tampering or
movement by human beings or adjacent entities.

01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:31.732
What are you trying to do, Jester? Someone over
here was trying to do something.

01:07:31.732 --> 01:07:35.494
LIAM: Oh, ritual casting Detect Magic, but that's
ten minutes of stoppage.

01:07:35.494 --> 01:07:36.719
TRAVIS: I'm walking back towards the cart.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.335
TALIESIN: We're keeping an eye out for anything
else happening.

01:07:39.335 --> 01:07:42.812
MARISHA: Can you do that ritual on the cart as we
drive away?

01:07:42.812 --> 01:07:44.211
MATT: Perception check, Beau?

01:07:44.211 --> 01:07:45.273
LIAM: I am busy.

01:07:45.273 --> 01:07:46.908
MATT: He's focusing.

01:07:50.448 --> 01:07:51.339
TALIESIN: 21.

01:07:51.339 --> 01:07:52.651
MARISHA: Eight?

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:57.500
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out, it doesn't appear
that there's any immediate sign of anyone

01:07:57.652 --> 01:08:02.373
approaching. By the time you finish completing the
ritual, you do a quick pass over. There are many

01:08:02.373 --> 01:08:07.518
magical auras around you, but they're your
friends. The various objects they're wearing and

01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:10.023
equipped light up, but there's nothing beyond
expected.

01:08:10.023 --> 01:08:12.984
LIAM: Nothing, stones, the dirt? Okay, we're good.
This place is clear. Let's get the hell out of here.

01:08:13.973 --> 01:08:17.450
MATT: You guys jog back to the cart, get up
inside, and start making your way south along the

01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:23.522
trail again with-- if someone wants to write it
down-- approximately 500 gold worth of gems.

01:08:23.522 --> 01:08:29.230
Rubies and emeralds. Because of a really high
perception check on Caduceus's end.

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:34.046
LAURA: My notebook, I don't know what happened to
it when we moved, so that's why I can't take notes

01:08:34.046 --> 01:08:34.575
anymore.

01:08:34.575 --> 01:08:37.423
TRAVIS: So many dicks lost to the move, oh no.

01:08:37.423 --> 01:08:39.491
LIAM: I lost all my dicks.

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:46.140
SAM: Our group inventory, though, is nonexistent
right now.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:51.082
LAURA: I'll find the notebook somehow. Don't
worry.

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:55.649
SAM: Can you be in charge again? You're fired.

01:08:55.649 --> 01:09:02.012
LAURA: You want me to be in charge of money, I'll
be in charge of the money. It reminds me of

01:09:02.012 --> 01:09:05.845
Caduceus. It's a unicorn. Ashley gave this to me.

01:09:05.845 --> 01:09:10.474
TRAVIS: I think we were saying we should probably
skedaddle.

01:09:10.474 --> 01:09:15.478
MATT: You make your way south along the trail. You
have one more day of travel before you get to

01:09:15.478 --> 01:09:17.306
Trostenwald. Caduceus, are you still leading?

01:09:17.306 --> 01:09:18.645
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm feeling good.

01:09:18.645 --> 01:09:19.971
MATT: Roll one more perception check.

01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:20.733
LAURA: I'll help him.

01:09:20.733 --> 01:09:21.562
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

01:09:21.562 --> 01:09:26.582
MARISHA: Find another geocache! Come on!

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:27.231
TALIESIN: 23.

01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:33.199
MATT: As you guys are heading southward on the
second day, Caduceus, you notice coming up over

01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:38.585
one of the hills a single horse with a single
rider moving at a very quick speed.

01:09:38.585 --> 01:09:40.483
SAM: Behind us or ahead of us?

01:09:40.483 --> 01:09:43.041
MATT: Heading towards your direction, heading
northward.

01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:44.749
TALIESIN: That looks like somebody on the run.

01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:47.396
LAURA: (whispering) That looks like somebody who's
going to pick up some jewels.

01:09:47.396 --> 01:09:48.763
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah, maybe that's the guy.

01:09:48.763 --> 01:09:50.773
LAURA: Everybody, look casual!

01:09:50.773 --> 01:09:52.712
SAM: Wait, no, we're inside an invisible--

01:09:52.712 --> 01:10:01.826
TALIESIN: I'm going to change my appearance. To a
grungy human with shaggy hair.

01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:04.942
LAURA: I see him do that. I do the same thing.

01:10:04.942 --> 01:10:05.548
MATT: So, Caleb?

01:10:05.548 --> 01:10:15.514
TALIESIN: A long orange goatee, a puffy red beard,
and scruffy long red hair. Human Tasmanian Devil.

01:10:15.514 --> 01:10:19.217
LAURA: I make myself look like a young human girl
with lots of freckles and big, poofy red hair.

01:10:19.217 --> 01:10:22.032
TALIESIN: We look related, then?

01:10:22.032 --> 01:10:25.095
MATT: The two of you are at the front of the cart.
Everyone else?

01:10:25.095 --> 01:10:27.108
MARISHA: We're hiding in the invisible cart.

01:10:27.108 --> 01:10:30.268
LIAM: That's how it works, right? Everyone in the
bed is--

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:33.396
MATT: Everyone in the bed is not visible. They are
held behind the illusion.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.805
LAURA: He's driving the cart.

01:10:34.805 --> 01:10:37.858
TRAVIS: I jump in the invisible part of the cart.

01:10:37.858 --> 01:10:44.864
MATT: As the rest of you head back into the
illusion, you continue moseying forward on the

01:10:44.864 --> 01:10:53.864
cart, and you hear the hooves getting louder and
closer. As they go screaming by you at the side,

01:10:53.864 --> 01:10:59.040
there's that moment where time seems to slow, as
you see that individual, their face mostly covered

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:05.118
by a dark red or purple bit of cloth, like a
facemask. A hood that is up but slipping back, and

01:11:05.118 --> 01:11:12.030
a little bit of tousled black hair, with a little
bit of salt and pepper on the sides. A large cloak

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:18.821
underneath, with a cloth mantle over that's also
blowing behind slowly. Darkly dressed, like a

01:11:18.821 --> 01:11:22.729
highwayman that is in the process of trying to get
somewhere quickly, whether it be with a delivery

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:29.260
or trying to meet up with somebody. In that moment
you watch them glance out the side of their eye at

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:34.721
the two of you in the cart, and then race off. Not
slowing, not stopping.

01:11:34.721 --> 01:11:36.077
TRAVIS: Dark salt and pepper hair?

01:11:36.077 --> 01:11:37.454
LIAM: It was Travis.

01:11:37.454 --> 01:11:42.634
MATT: I put Travis in the game. Meta!

01:11:42.634 --> 01:11:43.996
TRAVIS: You couldn't see how long his hair was
underneath?

01:11:43.996 --> 01:11:48.547
MATT: No, the hood was starting to come back from
the wind as the rider tried to keep it down.

01:11:48.547 --> 01:11:49.373
TRAVIS: Pale skin?

01:11:49.373 --> 01:11:55.496
MATT: No, from the little bit of face showing
around the eyes, it looked like it had been fairly

01:11:55.496 --> 01:12:03.850
tanned, probably from sun and a lot of travel out
in the open. They took one quick but very detailed

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:08.382
glance towards the two of you and then screamed on
ahead northward, past the cart.

01:12:08.382 --> 01:12:10.604
LAURA: You're very quick, you!

01:12:10.604 --> 01:12:12.037
TALIESIN: We do okay.

01:12:12.665 --> 01:12:18.419
MATT: Then you continue southward. For the better
part of the next day, you eventually can see, as

01:12:18.419 --> 01:12:24.266
you come around one bend, where some of the larger
hills are beginning to weave around the road as it

01:12:24.266 --> 01:12:30.420
begins to curve left and right. In the distance, a
number of birds are starting to fly in larger

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:37.261
flocks and encircling what now reveals itself to
be the familiar sight of the Ustaloch below. You

01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:42.353
can see ahead of you the city of Trostenwald,
where a lot of your crazy adventures together

01:12:42.353 --> 01:12:50.602
began. It's not quite dusk. You're about two hours
from dusk. You begin to make your way down towards

01:12:50.602 --> 01:12:58.438
the city itself. It's as busy and lazy as you
remember. As you reach the outer streets of the

01:12:58.438 --> 01:13:03.008
township, there are people coming up and down the
various streets with carts and wares. You can see

01:13:03.008 --> 01:13:08.918
folks that are passing through, hopefully on a
trade route. Some folks that look like they're

01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:15.747
stuck here. A lot of carts that are built up on
the outside that are either waiting for some sort

01:13:15.747 --> 01:13:20.581
of sign to continue travel, or are still packing
up before they leave for whatever their next

01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:29.460
destination may be. What would you like to do? If
anything.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.931
SAM: Are we stopping here? We've got to stop for
the night, right?

01:13:31.931 --> 01:13:34.021
LAURA: Probably. It's getting late.

01:13:34.021 --> 01:13:35.462
SAM: Wait, do people hate us here? I've
forgotten.

01:13:35.462 --> 01:13:37.871
LAURA: No, no, no. I don't think they do.

01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:40.534
TRAVIS: We got a stern warning as we left.

01:13:40.534 --> 01:13:43.096
LAURA: We could go see Gustav.

01:13:43.096 --> 01:13:45.688
MARISHA: Yeah, why don't we stop by the Nestled
Nook?

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:47.675
LIAM: Yeah, if it's easy. Yeah.

01:13:47.675 --> 01:13:49.395
MARISHA: See who's there.

01:13:49.395 --> 01:13:56.615
MATT: You guys make your way to the Nestled Nook.
You come upon the familiar tavern. Entering

01:13:56.615 --> 01:14:04.523
inside, you can see the familiar face of Yorda,
the older woman who runs the tavern, and glances

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:09.119
up from wiping off a table in the far corner
before her eyes peer over towards you from her

01:14:09.119 --> 01:14:16.225
tousled blond hair. "Oh, hello there! It's some
familiar faces! It's been some time. Welcome.

01:14:16.225 --> 01:14:20.553
"Well, do sit down. Drinks? Rounds? What are you
asking for?"

01:14:20.553 --> 01:14:22.383
SAM: Well, we're in Trostenwald, right?

01:14:22.383 --> 01:14:24.379
LIAM: You have a trost here; that's what you do.

01:14:24.379 --> 01:14:29.564
MATT: "Trost it may be. All right. But you're in
Trost, there's quite a few Trostenwald brews."

01:14:29.564 --> 01:14:30.949
SAM: Von Brandt for me, please.

01:14:30.949 --> 01:14:32.284
MATT: "Von Brandt it is."

01:14:32.284 --> 01:14:33.471
MARISHA: Same for me.

01:14:33.471 --> 01:14:34.851
MATT: "All right, table of von Brandts."

01:14:34.851 --> 01:14:36.358
LAURA: Milk for me, please.

01:14:36.358 --> 01:14:42.883
MATT: "Milk for that one. Of course. All right,
I'll be right back." Yorda makes her way to go

01:14:42.883 --> 01:14:50.247
fill the rest of your order. You guys take a while
here and rest in for a bit. You see Adelaine,

01:14:50.247 --> 01:14:56.793
who's the other barmaid that's helping with the
tavern, in the process of going around and filling

01:14:56.793 --> 01:15:04.222
the few orders that she has to at this hour.
Kluss, the clerk, the reedy-looking young man, is

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:11.121
in the back, currently going through paperwork and
trying to keep tabs on a number of ledgers and

01:15:11.121 --> 01:15:16.829
business elements. The evening is yours. Do you
wish to do anything, or are you going to bed down

01:15:16.829 --> 01:15:18.691
for the evening and continue the following day?

01:15:18.691 --> 01:15:19.943
MARISHA: I flag down Adla.

01:15:19.943 --> 01:15:21.191
MATT: Adelaine?

01:15:21.191 --> 01:15:22.408
MARISHA: Adelaine?

01:15:22.408 --> 01:15:25.011
(laughter)

01:15:25.011 --> 01:15:25.844
TRAVIS: Adla for short.

01:15:25.844 --> 01:15:31.778
MATT: Adelaine makes her way to your table.
"Hello? You looking for something?"

01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:41.219
MARISHA: Yeah, I was curious if you've seen Gustav
around. Tall, thin, elvish-looking man.

01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:42.734
LAURA: Is he not in jail?

01:15:42.734 --> 01:15:44.048
SAM: I think he's in jail, isn't he?

01:15:44.048 --> 01:15:46.327
MATT: "I'm sorry, I don't think I know a Gustav."

01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:52.443
MARISHA: I thought he was working off his debt. I
thought he was-- right?

01:15:52.443 --> 01:15:58.218
MATT: He was working off his debt. You don't know
the specific circumstances of it.

01:15:58.218 --> 01:16:01.319
MARISHA: Interesting. All right, thanks.

01:16:01.319 --> 01:16:04.113
MATT: "Of course, sorry. Would you like anything
else?"

01:16:04.113 --> 01:16:06.171
MARISHA: Another round of drinks.

01:16:06.171 --> 01:16:07.325
MATT: "Right away."

01:16:07.325 --> 01:16:10.963
LAURA: Could I have some chocolate? And some
milk?

01:16:10.963 --> 01:16:18.630
MATT: "I'll see what we have in the back."
Adelaine goes off, and does return with milk and--

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:25.640
it's a little old, it's starting to get some of
that white powder fringe to the chocolate, but

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.836
it's functional.

01:16:26.836 --> 01:16:29.533
LAURA: Yeah! I heat it up and I put it in my
milk.

01:16:29.533 --> 01:16:33.515
TRAVIS: I'm glad to see your prickly demeanor is
still in shape.

01:16:33.515 --> 01:16:38.761
MARISHA: Oh, well, I didn't have you around for a
little bit, keeping me in check.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.133
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.

01:16:40.133 --> 01:16:43.875
MARISHA: I tried to do okay, though. I think I did
all right. Did I do okay, Caleb?

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:44.959
LIAM: I wasn't paying attention.

01:16:44.959 --> 01:16:45.984
MARISHA: Never mind.

01:16:49.774 --> 01:16:51.143
LIAM: Could I get a bowl, please?

01:16:51.143 --> 01:16:58.230
MATT: A bowl is retrieved for you quite easily. As
Yorda throws it on the table, "Would you like

01:16:58.230 --> 01:16:59.701
"something in the bowl, dear?"

01:16:59.701 --> 01:17:03.726
LIAM: Oh, I was going to borrow from a friend, but
yeah, I will take a little bit of milk in it, please.

01:17:03.773 --> 01:17:08.421
MATT: "Milk it'll be." And she goes and returns
with a bowl about half-filled with milk.

01:17:08.421 --> 01:17:13.690
LIAM: I put it on the floor and I snap him into
existence. There you go, buddy.

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:14.960
LAURA: Does he have to eat?

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.119
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to ask.

01:17:16.119 --> 01:17:16.670
LIAM: No.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:17.609
LAURA: But he likes it?

01:17:17.609 --> 01:17:19.166
LIAM: Yeah.

01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:20.450
LAURA: I understand that.

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:28.367
MATT: You look down under the table, at Frumpkin
sitting at the bowl going--

01:17:28.367 --> 01:17:31.161
LIAM: He really likes it.

01:17:31.161 --> 01:17:35.432
TRAVIS: (cat noises)

01:17:35.432 --> 01:17:37.521
LIAM: No no. No no no!

01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:42.876
SAM: You know, with cats, it's really all of their
emotions are your emotions projected on them,

01:17:42.876 --> 01:17:47.189
anyway, so that's how it works with cats. They
feel nothing.

01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:54.291
LIAM: It is painfully true, in my case. And I tell
Frumpkin to start drinking milk.

01:17:54.291 --> 01:17:59.340
MATT: (unwilling groan)

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:03.210
LIAM: Just a little bit. Put some fat on those fey
bones of yours.

01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:11.507
MATT: As Frumpkin begrudgingly, at the command of
his master, "enjoys" a bowl of milk--

01:18:11.507 --> 01:18:13.539
SAM: You can't win!

01:18:13.539 --> 01:18:20.941
LIAM: Please, send me your emails for abusing my
fey magical cat!

01:18:20.941 --> 01:18:26.012
MATT: It's fine. Frumpkin can drink milk. Frumpkin
just has no need for it.

01:18:26.012 --> 01:18:29.137
LIAM: Yeah, it's like Vax, near the end.

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:33.714
MATT: It's a placebo for the master. It's like,
"If it makes the master happy, I'll drink this

01:18:33.714 --> 01:18:34.506
"milk for you."

01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:35.593
LIAM: Yeah, like Vax, near the end.

01:18:35.593 --> 01:18:39.115
MATT: Yeah, exactly. And you get the sense, too,
that the entire time that Frumpkin is drinking

01:18:39.372 --> 01:18:41.795
from this bowl, Frumpkin is making direct eye
contact with Caleb.

01:18:41.795 --> 01:18:45.800
LIAM: (as Vax) Oh, this sandwich is so good.
Mmm.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.969
(laughter)

01:18:48.969 --> 01:18:53.965
TRAVIS: Should we try to see Gustav tonight?

01:18:53.965 --> 01:18:55.546
MARISHA: What time is it?

01:18:55.546 --> 01:19:01.831
MATT: Right now, it's about dusk. By the time
you've come in the city, you've come to the inn, you've

01:19:01.831 --> 01:19:04.617
got food and drinks, and you settled for a bit,
it's about dusk now.

01:19:04.617 --> 01:19:05.436
MARISHA: Sure.

01:19:05.436 --> 01:19:10.542
SAM: All right, but before we go over there, are
we going to plunk down 2,000 gold to get this

01:19:10.982 --> 01:19:12.499
near-stranger out of debt?

01:19:12.499 --> 01:19:13.450
MARISHA: No.

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:15.568
LIAM: I don't think we have that. Do we want to do
a little--

01:19:15.568 --> 01:19:18.381
SAM: We all do if we pitch in together, I'm sure.

01:19:18.381 --> 01:19:20.463
LIAM: I don't think that's true, but we could do a
token.

01:19:20.463 --> 01:19:22.198
SAM: I have almost that much.

01:19:22.198 --> 01:19:32.206
LAURA: You have almost that much? Holy mo--
(gasps) You have so much money!

01:19:32.206 --> 01:19:33.215
TALIESIN: That's obscene.

01:19:33.215 --> 01:19:34.421
SAM: I never pay for anything.

01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:36.037
MATT: Yeah. You guys have bought everything for
Nott.

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:39.411
LAURA: That's great.

01:19:39.411 --> 01:19:41.134
TRAVIS: Did you want to bail him out?

01:19:41.134 --> 01:19:42.564
SAM: Heavens, no.

01:19:42.564 --> 01:19:44.531
TRAVIS: You bailing him out tonight?

01:19:44.531 --> 01:19:46.372
SAM: No, I didn't say that--

01:19:46.372 --> 01:19:47.953
TRAVIS: That is so generous, Nott!

01:19:47.953 --> 01:19:49.739
SAM: I feel like you're putting words in my
mouth.

01:19:49.739 --> 01:19:53.986
TRAVIS: I feel like we should just carry you
through the town, crying out, "Gustav's release

01:19:53.986 --> 01:19:55.432
"paid by this sweet little girl!"

01:19:55.432 --> 01:19:57.022
MARISHA: So generous.

01:19:57.022 --> 01:20:01.432
SAM: I'm just going to get down on my knees and
start licking the milk as well.

01:20:01.432 --> 01:20:04.251
(laughter)

01:20:04.251 --> 01:20:06.865
MATT: Frumpkin side-eyes you while you both drink
the milk together.

01:20:06.865 --> 01:20:12.227
LAURA: You should put some chocolate in that. It's
better.

01:20:12.227 --> 01:20:15.106
MARISHA: Great for cats.

01:20:15.106 --> 01:20:18.202
TRAVIS: Well, we could go in the morning, it
doesn't matter.

01:20:18.202 --> 01:20:19.229
SAM: No, let's go now.

01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:28.114
MARISHA: Maybe we can wheel and deal with him. Pay
a lump sum now and consider it debt repaid, time served.

01:20:28.119 --> 01:20:34.505
LIAM: And if not, I feel like we should keep a
certain amount for ourselves for our travels, but

01:20:34.505 --> 01:20:37.898
we could leave a token sum to help him on the
way.

01:20:37.898 --> 01:20:42.239
MATT: Okay. So, where are you guys headed?

01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:44.364
LAURA: To the jail or wherever.

01:20:44.364 --> 01:20:46.784
MATT: It's the stockade. The stockade here is
where you had previously--

01:20:46.784 --> 01:20:50.553
LAURA: Yeah. Talk to Lawmaster Norda.

01:20:50.553 --> 01:20:53.542
LIAM: Remember that? Norda and Yorda.

01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:54.791
MARISHA: That's right.

01:20:54.791 --> 01:21:01.713
MATT: Yep, just to fuck with you. All right, so
you guys make your way to the stockade, and it

01:21:01.713 --> 01:21:05.944
takes a brief intro to the crownsguard outside
before you are brought back in. One of them

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:11.972
recognizes you from your previous encounter a few
months back and brings you to Norda's office, a

01:21:11.972 --> 01:21:20.772
familiar place you've been. Norda-- you can see
the dwarven woman, with very a tense and tired and

01:21:20.772 --> 01:21:25.987
just kind of over-it expression on her face,
glances up at you all. "All right, so it's been a bit."

01:21:25.999 --> 01:21:28.873
MARISHA: Hi.

01:21:28.873 --> 01:21:33.726
MATT: "Well, the good news is, nothing else died
since you've come back. That's--"

01:21:33.726 --> 01:21:35.482
TRAVIS: Excellent news. Very glad to hear that.

01:21:35.482 --> 01:21:38.488
MATT: "--positive. So, when are you leaving?"

01:21:38.488 --> 01:21:41.191
SAM and LAURA: Soon.

01:21:41.191 --> 01:21:43.860
MATT: "Great news. That's wonderful."

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:44.679
LIAM: In the morning.

01:21:44.679 --> 01:21:46.392
LAURA: Not everyone likes us.

01:21:46.392 --> 01:21:48.133
MATT: "Why are you in my office at this hour?"

01:21:48.133 --> 01:21:52.127
TRAVIS: We're just trying to achieve one thing,
and that was hopefully to get some eyes on our

01:21:52.127 --> 01:21:53.821
good friend Gustav, if we could.

01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:55.531
MATT: "You want to see Gustav?"

01:21:55.531 --> 01:21:57.897
LIAM: If that is permissible, ja.

01:21:57.897 --> 01:22:04.524
MATT: (sighs) "Fine," She gets up from behind the
desk and goes and reaches into this cubby and

01:22:04.524 --> 01:22:11.613
pulls out a ring of keys and, "Follow me." Leads
you back down into the familiar stair down below

01:22:11.613 --> 01:22:18.295
to a cell where a couple of you have been held
before. And there you can see, on the far end,

01:22:18.295 --> 01:22:23.537
there is a cell, and within this dark,
subterranean interior with the faint burning

01:22:23.537 --> 01:22:31.069
torchlight gives this ominous red-orange flicker
to the normally shaded interior. You see there,

01:22:31.069 --> 01:22:38.625
slumped against the wall, enjoying a bowl of some
sort of gray, mushy substance, a not

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:44.119
abused-and-filthy, but
a-little-rough-around-the-edges Gustav. Not

01:22:44.119 --> 01:22:51.969
chained, not shackled, and there is a chair and
there is a bed. You can see of the jail cells

01:22:51.969 --> 01:22:57.081
here, which are designed to just be abysmal, this
one-- some pains have been made to make it a

01:22:57.081 --> 01:22:57.937
little more comfortable.

01:22:57.937 --> 01:22:58.932
TRAVIS: Extended stay.

01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:00.915
LIAM: Roughly how long has it been since we were
here?

01:23:00.915 --> 01:23:03.904
MATT: Roughly about two and a half months, yeah.

01:23:03.904 --> 01:23:06.117
TRAVIS: How time flies.

01:23:06.117 --> 01:23:15.543
MATT: Best estimate. Even a little longer. I'm
sure CritRoleStats will let me know. But, in the

01:23:15.543 --> 01:23:22.189
proximity there, Norda comes up. "Hey, Gustav!
You've got visitors." Clinks the keys against the

01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:32.102
bars, and, "Oh, um, sorry. That's embarrassing."
He finishes a spoonful, sets it down. "Oh, my my

01:23:32.102 --> 01:23:39.125
"my, I was not expecting this at all." And you can
see the lanky elvish gentleman, his hair pushed

01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:46.756
back, a bit greasy, a bit of dirt on the edges of
the face, wearing the same nice long coat that you

01:23:46.756 --> 01:23:53.122
remember him wearing when you last saw him off.
Looks like he's been doing some hard work,

01:23:53.122 --> 01:23:59.409
probably a little thinner than even his previously
thin form was, but he's there. He approaches the

01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:06.434
edge of the bars. "By what might I have the
pleasure of you all coming to see me?"

01:24:06.434 --> 01:24:12.433
LIAM: Well. Pleasure. You know, we meant to return
sooner, but we've been a bit held up.

01:24:12.433 --> 01:24:15.658
MATT: "That's all right. I myself have, as well,
don't worry."

01:24:16.904 --> 01:24:24.345
LIAM: About that. We're not staying in town. We
are leaving in the morning, actually, but--

01:24:24.345 --> 01:24:30.632
LAURA: Hey, do you like it in this jail cell?
Maybe it's really comfortable, huh?

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:37.451
MATT: "Oh, it's not preferable by any means, but
it certainly beats going in here against my will."

01:24:37.928 --> 01:24:42.646
LIAM: How much-- if it's not too presumptuous, how
much do you have left to work off?

01:24:42.646 --> 01:24:47.387
MATT: "Oh, at the rate we've been going?" And he
looks over towards Norda. Norda's like, "If he

01:24:47.387 --> 01:24:51.548
"keeps working as hard as he has been, he's looking
at another seven, eight months, maybe."

01:24:51.548 --> 01:24:58.059
LIAM: What about remuneration, an amount? What is
left for him to work off?

01:24:58.059 --> 01:25:00.103
MATT: "I have to go look at the books, but I can
go check."

01:25:00.103 --> 01:25:01.883
LIAM: Ja, could you please?

01:25:01.883 --> 01:25:03.062
MATT: "What, you going to pay him off?"

01:25:03.062 --> 01:25:06.356
LIAM, LAURA, MARISHA: (ambiguous noises)

01:25:06.356 --> 01:25:07.438
TALIESIN: Barter it at the very least.

01:25:07.438 --> 01:25:09.592
TRAVIS: Maybe just a little something towards it,
if we could.

01:25:09.592 --> 01:25:14.493
MATT: Gustav, at this point, leans forward and
goes, "You are all very sweet, and I greatly

01:25:14.493 --> 01:25:18.403
"appreciate it, but this is my debt to pay, not
yours."

01:25:18.403 --> 01:25:21.589
LAURA and MARISHA: Well...

01:25:21.589 --> 01:25:24.158
LIAM: Could you go look up that number for us,
please?

01:25:24.158 --> 01:25:33.351
MATT: Norda goes, "You two keep an eye." And the
two crownsguard approach and get a bit closer

01:25:33.351 --> 01:25:37.927
while Norda heads back upstairs, Gustav still
pressed against the bars, his head peeking through

01:25:37.927 --> 01:25:43.497
the two sides, bit of scraggly hairs falling in
front of his face. "No, but I'm completely

01:25:43.497 --> 01:25:48.900
"serious. This is my burden. I chose it. You've all
done good work here, and--"

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:57.500
SAM: Caleb, I lived it, so I remember, but for
Caduceus, can you remind me why Gustav was locked

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.128
up again?

01:25:58.128 --> 01:26:02.717
(laughter)

01:26:02.717 --> 01:26:04.059
TRAVIS: The circus and the fucking--

01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:05.568
SAM: I know, but what did he do wrong?

01:26:05.568 --> 01:26:08.295
LIAM: He convinced the town that we all met--

01:26:08.295 --> 01:26:11.275
TALIESIN: He was responsible for the circus,
that's all, he just took responsibility.

01:26:11.275 --> 01:26:18.072
SAM: But that wasn't-- how would he know? This is
an innocent man! He didn't do anything bad, right?

01:26:18.589 --> 01:26:21.925
TALIESIN: I would love to have an insight check,
insight check from Caduceus.

01:26:21.925 --> 01:26:23.011
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:32.188
TALIESIN: I want to know what's going on in there.
That's a (counting) 27.

01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:33.535
MATT: 27.

01:26:33.535 --> 01:26:37.397
TALIESIN: I'm rolling real well today. Rolling
high.

01:26:42.037 --> 01:26:46.811
LIAM: Werewolves! Next week! Travis Willingham,
living his best life.

01:26:46.811 --> 01:26:47.788
SAM: Herewolves?

01:26:47.788 --> 01:26:49.267
LIAM: Therewolves.

01:26:49.267 --> 01:26:50.328
SAM: Werewolves.

01:26:50.328 --> 01:26:54.440
TRAVIS: Whywolves. Too many. Too many, sorry.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.979
SAM: We're all going to grow facial hair for next
week, right? You too?

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.371
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to wear a mustache.

01:26:59.371 --> 01:26:59.990
SAM: Cool.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.889
MATT: "But sincerely, I am very appreciative. Each
and every one of you."

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:16.120
LIAM: It's maybe a little bit for you, but also
for a friend. For-- I'm not good at this, does

01:27:16.519 --> 01:27:17.093
someone want to?

01:27:17.093 --> 01:27:18.089
TALIESIN: I can do this, if you like.

01:27:18.089 --> 01:27:19.246
SAM and MARISHA: You don't know him.

01:27:19.246 --> 01:27:20.287
TALIESIN: I don't have to know.

01:27:20.287 --> 01:27:27.934
SAM: Your friend and ours, Mollymauk, is no longer
of this world, and this would be a way of us

01:27:27.934 --> 01:27:31.869
saying-- putting his legacy at peace.

01:27:31.869 --> 01:27:37.486
MATT: "Well--"

01:27:37.486 --> 01:27:40.563
SAM: If we can afford it, no promises.

01:27:40.563 --> 01:27:43.042
LAURA: It depends on how much is left, because we
don't have a ton of money.

01:27:43.042 --> 01:27:50.572
MATT: "I'm just musing on how we found him and how
we left him."

01:27:50.572 --> 01:27:51.789
SAM: Which was?

01:27:51.789 --> 01:28:00.293
MATT: "A brief star burning very bright, but twice
as short. But no, when we found him outside of the

01:28:00.293 --> 01:28:10.621
"forests up north, he had no memory, no voice, no
words. He was basically a vegetable. But over

01:28:10.621 --> 01:28:20.132
"time, he came back to his senses, and yeah. It's a
shame. He was a good one."

01:28:20.132 --> 01:28:22.839
LIAM: We were fond of him, and he was fond of you,
so.

01:28:26.429 --> 01:28:33.479
MATT: "Well. That's the dangers of the world we
live in, I suppose."

01:28:33.479 --> 01:28:38.802
TRAVIS: I know you've taken this burden on
yourself, but I think we would all feel a bit

01:28:38.802 --> 01:28:46.323
better if you would accept this as a small
thank you, for then and now as well.

01:28:46.323 --> 01:28:55.410
TALIESIN: It's more than a thank you. I feel that
you have to be free, so that you can finally pay

01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:56.304
your debt.

01:29:00.764 --> 01:29:03.082
MATT: "This is me, paying my debt."

01:29:03.082 --> 01:29:12.089
TALIESIN: No, this is you hiding from your debt.
You're a man who is afraid of what you owe. I

01:29:12.089 --> 01:29:20.356
understand. That's okay. It'll feel so much better
when you're finally free from this belief.

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:26.201
MATT: "I don't know who you are, friend, but
you've stepped into a space where you have no

01:29:26.201 --> 01:29:30.535
knowledge, and, trust me, this is my debt to pay.
This is my responsibility."

01:29:30.535 --> 01:29:34.486
TALIESIN: This is not your debt. Your debt lies
elsewhere. I know these things.

01:29:34.486 --> 01:29:36.609
MARISHA: Caduceus. What the hell?

01:29:36.609 --> 01:29:39.344
TRAVIS: Why don't you make some tea and shut the
fuck up for a second?

01:29:39.344 --> 01:29:46.081
MATT: "Anyway, I should finish my meal."

01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:48.143
TALIESIN: It'll be your last one in here.

01:29:48.143 --> 01:29:53.946
MATT: He goes over and grabs the bowl, and
quietly, while looking at Caduceus, begins to eat

01:29:53.946 --> 01:29:55.047
his gray mush.

01:29:55.047 --> 01:29:57.712
LAURA: Can you tell the future?

01:29:57.712 --> 01:29:58.517
TALIESIN: No.

01:29:58.517 --> 01:29:59.824
LAURA: Can you tell the past?

01:29:59.824 --> 01:30:01.601
TALIESIN: I just know a guilty man when I see
one.

01:30:01.601 --> 01:30:03.076
LAURA: (gasps) Is he a guilty man?

01:30:03.076 --> 01:30:04.546
TRAVIS: Are we out of earshot?

01:30:04.546 --> 01:30:05.489
SAM: Is he a bad guy?

01:30:05.489 --> 01:30:07.255
MATT: You can move out of earshot.

01:30:07.255 --> 01:30:10.293
TRAVIS: Let's all group shuffle out of earshot.

01:30:10.293 --> 01:30:13.606
(laughter)

01:30:13.606 --> 01:30:16.641
MATT: You bump into the Crownsguard behind you.
"Oh, excuse me."

01:30:16.641 --> 01:30:18.555
TRAVIS: Caduceus! What was that? Where did that
come from?!

01:30:18.555 --> 01:30:19.635
TALIESIN: He doesn't want to leave.

01:30:19.635 --> 01:30:21.969
LAURA: He looks really happy in here, right?

01:30:21.969 --> 01:30:24.409
TALIESIN: He's not even happy, he's hiding in
here.

01:30:24.409 --> 01:30:28.418
SAM: Well, then, maybe we should leave him in
here, if he feels unsafe on the outside.

01:30:28.418 --> 01:30:31.740
TALIESIN: It's not that he feels unsafe, you can
just see-- it's all over his face.

01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.119
SAM: I can't-- just looks like a dude.

01:30:34.119 --> 01:30:35.978
TRAVIS: You can tell that just from looking at
him?

01:30:35.978 --> 01:30:38.703
TALIESIN: You can tell a lot from people just by
looking at them.

01:30:38.703 --> 01:30:40.133
LAURA: What do you think when you look at me?

01:30:40.133 --> 01:30:46.968
TALIESIN: That's an entire conversation for
later.

01:30:46.968 --> 01:30:48.003
LAURA: Okay.

01:30:48.003 --> 01:30:51.762
SAM: Caduceus, how will Fjord-- how and when will
Fjord die?

01:30:51.762 --> 01:30:52.959
TALIESIN: In a terrible crash.

01:30:52.959 --> 01:30:54.568
LAURA: (gasps)

01:30:54.568 --> 01:30:57.037
TALIESIN: With a man named Buick

01:30:57.037 --> 01:31:00.961
(laughter)

01:31:00.961 --> 01:31:05.826
LIAM: Yeah, so back to the situation at hand. You
are suggesting we continue doing what we're doing?

01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:09.061
TALIESIN: I want to see-- I think this is a man
who needs to be free so that he can be at peace

01:31:09.061 --> 01:31:09.650
with himself.

01:31:09.650 --> 01:31:14.064
MARISHA: And where are you getting all of this
insight?

01:31:14.064 --> 01:31:16.349
LAURA: (whispers) His brain.

01:31:16.349 --> 01:31:23.405
TALIESIN: Why would you not want to-- why would
you want to be in a cell? Why would you want to

01:31:23.405 --> 01:31:25.683
stay there? Someone's offering you freedom for
nothing.

01:31:25.683 --> 01:31:27.854
SAM: We've been in a cell. It's not fun.

01:31:27.854 --> 01:31:32.018
TALIESIN: He's putting on-- there's so much there.
He's hiding something.

01:31:32.018 --> 01:31:34.213
MARISHA: I'm not arguing prison politics--

01:31:34.213 --> 01:31:35.593
SAM: Well, let's find out how much.

01:31:35.593 --> 01:31:38.611
MARISHA: I agree with you, I just feel like
there's a supernatural situation going on here

01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:40.265
that you're not necessarily telling us.

01:31:40.265 --> 01:31:41.518
TALIESIN: I just know-- I just--

01:31:41.518 --> 01:31:47.116
MATT: At this point, Norda returns, coming
shuffling back down with a small, leather-bound

01:31:47.116 --> 01:31:52.326
journal or book of some kind. "All right. Looking
at this one, keeping tabs on what he's able to

01:31:52.326 --> 01:31:57.897
"make, the reparations he's made, the amounts of
money he was able to have brought in from friends

01:31:57.897 --> 01:32:05.213
"to help pay the debt, we're still sitting at about
2,100 gold pieces."

01:32:05.213 --> 01:32:06.762
SAM: I thought it was 2,000 to start?!

01:32:06.762 --> 01:32:11.253
MATT: "2,645."

01:32:11.253 --> 01:32:14.273
TALIESIN: I will throw some money at this.

01:32:14.273 --> 01:32:16.762
LAURA: I don't have any money to throw at this.

01:32:16.762 --> 01:32:19.017
SAM: That's kind of rich for my blood.

01:32:19.017 --> 01:32:21.977
LAURA: Well, I guess I have a little money to
throw at this.

01:32:21.977 --> 01:32:26.150
SAM: If we put all of our money together, how much
would it be?

01:32:26.150 --> 01:32:31.059
TALIESIN: Would there be a buyout cost, if we
wanted to pay it? Is that just the straight-- or

01:32:31.059 --> 01:32:32.269
could there be some sort of deal?

01:32:32.269 --> 01:32:32.998
MATT: Are you asking?

01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:33.518
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:32:34.438 --> 01:32:37.221
MATT: "What are you-- a buyout?"

01:32:37.221 --> 01:32:42.917
TALIESIN: Weirdly-- and I dont know, you've spent
more time with him-- but he strikes me as a man

01:32:42.917 --> 01:32:48.689
who's, weirdly, happier in jail right now than
he'd be out of it.

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:50.785
MATT: "He's fucking weird, I'll tell you that."

01:32:50.785 --> 01:32:58.946
TALIESIN: I think he needs to face some stuff. It
would be really healthy for everyone involved.

01:32:58.946 --> 01:33:00.396
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:33:00.396 --> 01:33:06.848
TRAVIS: Come on, you tall, magical cow.

01:33:06.848 --> 01:33:08.289
TALIESIN: That's 12.

01:33:08.289 --> 01:33:11.371
LIAM: (whispers) This got weird so quickly.

01:33:11.371 --> 01:33:20.410
MATT: "Tell you what, you go ahead and toss down
about 1,700 right now? I'll kick his ass out."

01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:22.755
TALIESIN: I'll put 400 gold down right now.

01:33:22.755 --> 01:33:26.159
LAURA: I can put 50 gold in.

01:33:26.159 --> 01:33:28.109
SAM: No, save your 50 gold.

01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:29.040
MARISHA: How much?

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:35.474
MATT: Gustav has come back to the bars and is
like, "You all are being absurdly generous--"

01:33:35.474 --> 01:33:37.624
TALIESIN: There's no generosity in this.

01:33:37.624 --> 01:33:40.098
MATT: "--and this is not necessary at all. I mean
it, I mean it."

01:33:40.098 --> 01:33:44.041
SAM: I can put down a thousand.

01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:46.054
TRAVIS: Gold?!

01:33:46.054 --> 01:33:48.349
TALIESIN: We're at 14, we need three more.

01:33:48.349 --> 01:33:51.406
LIAM: I will put in 100 gold.

01:33:51.406 --> 01:33:53.458
MARISHA: She wanted to do 1,700?

01:33:53.458 --> 01:33:55.239
LIAM: We are at 15 now.

01:33:55.239 --> 01:34:12.598
MARISHA: I throw in 165 that's Molly's, but also,
hang on. Before we do all this. Listen, Norda, I

01:34:12.598 --> 01:34:18.036
know we caused a lot of a headache for you when
all this was going down.

01:34:18.036 --> 01:34:23.364
MATT: "You were one of many. There's at least, at
any given point in time, 17 headaches in here, so

01:34:23.364 --> 01:34:24.599
"yeah, that's one of them."

01:34:24.599 --> 01:34:31.929
MARISHA: So, we're simply trying to take one more
headache off of your list of a lot of headaches.

01:34:31.929 --> 01:34:39.870
We're trying to do a good thing. A man in jail
doesn't do anything for your city, but I bet 1,500

01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:41.721
right now would.

01:34:41.721 --> 01:34:45.506
TRAVIS: Don't have to empty the bedpans, change
the sheets.

01:34:45.506 --> 01:34:46.929
MARISHA: Don't have to feed him.

01:34:46.929 --> 01:34:51.929
MATT: The crownsguard to the left of you goes,
"You should listen to her. Those bedpans are

01:34:51.929 --> 01:34:53.168
"pretty terrible."

01:34:53.168 --> 01:34:58.750
MARISHA: Think of what you can do for this town
with 1,500 gold right now, because let me tell

01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:04.478
you, we can't give you that 1,700. So we either
walk and you're stuck with a prisoner for another

01:35:04.478 --> 01:35:07.819
nine months, or you take the 1,500.

01:35:07.819 --> 01:35:12.179
MATT: Make one last persuasion check.
This will be at a higher DC.

01:35:12.179 --> 01:35:15.552
TRAVIS: Can I assist this as a charismatic fucking
half-orc?

01:35:16.838 --> 01:35:18.856
MATT: What do you say to assist her?

01:35:19.698 --> 01:35:28.669
TRAVIS: Oh. What I just said. (singing) Listen to
Beau, she knows the score.

01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:31.947
(laughter)

01:35:31.947 --> 01:35:32.894
TALIESIN: Interpretive dance.

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:33.571
MARISHA: Jazz hands!

01:35:33.571 --> 01:35:40.087
MATT: You watch as the Lawmaster's eyebrow raises
to the--

01:35:40.087 --> 01:35:41.240
TRAVIS: And I wink.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.609
LIAM: Jesus.

01:35:43.609 --> 01:35:46.671
LAURA: (laughs) Oh my god.

01:35:46.671 --> 01:35:53.364
MATT: For the first time since you've seen Norda,
you see a smile curl across her face. She goes,

01:35:53.364 --> 01:35:59.353
"If that's not the weirdest thing I've seen in
some time." Make your check with advantage.

01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:08.426
MARISHA: Hey! Natural 20! Yeah, jazz hands work
every fucking time!

01:36:08.426 --> 01:36:09.733
SAM: What was the other number?

01:36:09.733 --> 01:36:10.732
MARISHA: 17!

01:36:10.732 --> 01:36:12.180
LAURA: Okay, okay, still good.

01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:14.551
MATT: "1,500 and we'll call it even."

01:36:14.551 --> 01:36:15.501
MARISHA: All right.

01:36:15.501 --> 01:36:16.522
TALIESIN: I gave you four.

01:36:16.522 --> 01:36:20.644
MARISHA: How much was it? I've got 165 that was
Molly's.

01:36:20.644 --> 01:36:23.302
LAURA: This is like us trying to figure out a
check.

01:36:23.302 --> 01:36:24.402
MATT: I know, isn't it?

01:36:24.402 --> 01:36:26.811
MARISHA: I can throw in money as well, because
that was part of my goal.

01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:31.538
LIAM: Just keep 65 and spend 100 of Molly's, to
keep it simple.

01:36:31.538 --> 01:36:32.653
MARISHA: Okay.

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:36.776
MATT: That's a thousand, 300--

01:36:36.776 --> 01:36:39.709
TALIESIN: 400. I think it was 400, yeah.

01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:41.078
MATT: So you only need a hundred.

01:36:41.078 --> 01:36:42.795
LIAM: I'm keeping my money, then.

01:36:42.795 --> 01:36:45.450
MATT: Nott threw down a thousand.

01:36:45.450 --> 01:36:46.298
LIAM: Solid.

01:36:46.298 --> 01:36:48.555
TALIESIN: I already knocked it off. Thank you,
Nott.

01:36:48.555 --> 01:36:53.715
MATT: The crownsguard begin gathering the money
from you guys and bringing over small chests to

01:36:53.715 --> 01:36:59.597
put the large amount of coin over. As this is
happening, Gustav leans his back towards the

01:36:59.597 --> 01:37:05.837
stones at the edge, and his eyes are just wide in
disbelief. "I don't know what to say."

01:37:05.837 --> 01:37:07.890
LAURA: Say thank you!

01:37:07.890 --> 01:37:08.746
MATT: "Thank you!"

01:37:08.746 --> 01:37:10.242
LAURA: I cast Wand of Smiles at him.

01:37:10.242 --> 01:37:13.319
MATT: What's the DC on that? Is it a charisma
save?

01:37:13.319 --> 01:37:15.130
LAURA: It's a charisma save.

01:37:15.130 --> 01:37:17.571
MATT: That's a natural eight.

01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:20.141
LAURA: Oh, good, you have to smile!

01:37:20.141 --> 01:37:22.934
MATT: He sits there, eyes wide.

01:37:22.934 --> 01:37:25.057
LAURA: Yay, he's so happy!

01:37:25.057 --> 01:37:31.983
MATT: Norda takes the keys and heads over and
opens it up. "All right, punk, you're a free man.

01:37:32.257 --> 01:37:38.413
"Congratulations. For some odd reason, these folks
decided that you were worth a lot of money to not

01:37:38.413 --> 01:37:45.457
"be here, so be thankful that somehow the great
gods have looked down upon you and Erathis

01:37:45.457 --> 01:37:52.960
"decided, 'You know what, fuck law! You're free.'"
So the guards escort him out. You guys all head to

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:59.321
the outside. You all get led outside of the
stockade and Norda says, "All right, well, that's

01:37:59.321 --> 01:38:03.967
"been a pleasure. I'm going to go ahead and go
home, have a drink, and get some fucking sleep."

01:38:03.967 --> 01:38:05.515
TRAVIS: Excellent idea.

01:38:05.515 --> 01:38:12.835
MATT: "Don't get anyone else killed." She heads
back inside. Gustav is stepping out there, his hat

01:38:12.835 --> 01:38:19.458
that he just had retrieved and given back to him,
he puts on, steadies his coat, grabs the small

01:38:19.458 --> 01:38:29.172
sack of his personal belongings and turns around
to the rest of you. "I-- (laughs) Thank you. This

01:38:29.172 --> 01:38:30.510
"is more than I would have expected."

01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:32.332
LIAM: What will you do now?

01:38:32.332 --> 01:38:43.945
MATT: "I don't know. I mean, the circus is
scattered. I would ask where Yasha was-- she would

01:38:43.945 --> 01:38:48.691
"be a good right-hand man-- but I don't see her
around. Did she also--?"

01:38:48.691 --> 01:38:53.548
TRAVIS: No, she took off like she does.

01:38:53.548 --> 01:38:55.211
LIAM: Your guess is as good as ours.

01:38:55.211 --> 01:38:56.677
MARISHA: Maybe you could find her.

01:38:56.677 --> 01:38:58.698
LAURA: She's up north.

01:38:58.698 --> 01:39:02.572
MARISHA: We're heading to the Menagerie Coast.

01:39:02.572 --> 01:39:08.807
MATT: "Huh, Menagerie Coast. Haven't been there in
a long time."

01:39:08.807 --> 01:39:15.202
MARISHA: You're more than welcome to hop on the
wagon, if you want. Can't promise much more beyond that.

01:39:15.773 --> 01:39:20.467
MATT: "Oh, I'm fine. Thank you, I appreciate it. I
should probably tie up some loose ends now that I

01:39:20.467 --> 01:39:26.651
"have availability to do so. Thanks to you and your
generosity."

01:39:26.651 --> 01:39:28.472
TALIESIN: A word of advice.

01:39:28.472 --> 01:39:29.244
MATT: "Mm-hmm?"

01:39:29.244 --> 01:39:39.770
TALIESIN: Whatever was keeping you in this cell,
whatever was making you comfortable in here, be

01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:48.586
careful of it. There's something inside you that's
trying to put you in a box. Whatever guilt you're

01:39:48.586 --> 01:39:57.923
feeling, whatever thing that you feel that you're
to blame for, I would unload that burden. If not

01:39:57.923 --> 01:40:00.744
on us, on somebody, although we're happy to take
it.

01:40:00.744 --> 01:40:02.804
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:40:02.804 --> 01:40:07.100
TALIESIN: Intimidation is fine. I was trying to be
kind of nice.

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.803
MATT: It can ride a line.

01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:10.814
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:40:10.814 --> 01:40:25.797
MATT: "I appreciate your candor and advice, tall
furry man. Maybe I'll find an ear to bend one day.

01:40:25.797 --> 01:40:35.543
"Until then, let Gustav Fletching be forever your
humble servant."

01:40:35.543 --> 01:40:40.928
MARISHA: Do you mean that? Like, if we ever need
you, can we hit you up?

01:40:40.928 --> 01:40:42.671
TRAVIS: It's an expression.

01:40:42.671 --> 01:40:45.271
MARISHA: Yeah but I'm asking because he offered.

01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:48.980
MATT: "Sure, I've got nothing else going on. Come
find me."

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:49.977
MARISHA: I don't need you right now.

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:51.272
MATT: "Well, then come find me!"

01:40:51.272 --> 01:40:51.990
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:54.628
LAURA: We'll send you a message, don't you worry!

01:40:54.628 --> 01:41:06.951
MATT: "I'm sure. Well, good night." He walks off
on his lanky legs, almost bending with each step.

01:41:06.951 --> 01:41:11.306
He's such a strange, gangly elf. You've never
quite seen an individual of his physicality.

01:41:11.306 --> 01:41:15.235
LIAM: Boy, not that any of us can complain, but
that guy likes to lay it on thick.

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:16.544
TALIESIN: He's very sad.

01:41:16.544 --> 01:41:22.202
MARISHA: Fjord does this mean I'm not the most
abrasive person in the group any more?

01:41:22.202 --> 01:41:27.638
SAM: I don't know if Deuce is abrasive; just sort
of awkward, aloof.

01:41:27.638 --> 01:41:30.115
TRAVIS: Yeah, just blunt.

01:41:30.115 --> 01:41:36.601
TALIESIN: I see funny rocks, I see funny people,
and this is not sitting right, there's something

01:41:36.601 --> 01:41:38.123
unnatural about the build.

01:41:38.123 --> 01:41:41.551
LAURA: When you drink tea made of dead people, you
see things.

01:41:41.551 --> 01:41:44.490
MARISHA: I toss Caduceus a little pouch.

01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:48.631
TALIESIN: I would like to make a dexterity check
to see if I catch it?

01:41:48.631 --> 01:41:49.370
MATT: Yeah.

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:50.325
TALIESIN: If that's okay?

01:41:50.325 --> 01:41:51.158
MATT: Sure.

01:41:51.158 --> 01:41:53.153
SAM: (sneezes)

01:41:53.153 --> 01:41:53.980
LAURA: Bless you.

01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.533
SAM: (sneezes)

01:41:55.533 --> 01:41:56.883
LAURA and MATT: Bless you.

01:41:56.883 --> 01:41:57.708
TALIESIN: 12.

01:41:57.708 --> 01:42:02.093
MATT: It's more of a--. You have to save it, but
you catch it.

01:42:02.093 --> 01:42:11.189
MARISHA: That's what's left of Molly's gold, 65.
Figured since you put down so much money for a

01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:14.414
stranger to be busted out, a little bit of
reimbursement.

01:42:14.414 --> 01:42:17.130
TALIESIN: Appreciate that, that's nice of you.

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.615
MARISHA: Why? Why'd you do it?

01:42:18.615 --> 01:42:29.388
TALIESIN: I told you why. I told him why. Because
it's not healthy to sit there and just hide from

01:42:29.388 --> 01:42:30.271
your problems.

01:42:30.271 --> 01:42:33.666
MARISHA: That's a lot of money for an esoteric
reason.

01:42:33.666 --> 01:42:34.671
TALIESIN: Is it?

01:42:34.671 --> 01:42:36.220
LIAM and TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:37.816
TALIESIN: How much money was it?

01:42:37.816 --> 01:42:38.990
MARISHA: 400 gold!

01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:40.564
TALIESIN: Yeah, how much is that?

01:42:40.564 --> 01:42:41.498
LAURA: It's a lot!

01:42:41.498 --> 01:42:43.236
MARISHA: Oh!

01:42:43.236 --> 01:42:47.029
LAURA: Where did you even get that gold?

01:42:47.029 --> 01:42:48.537
SAM: We all divided it.

01:42:48.537 --> 01:42:49.886
LIAM: That's tea for life.

01:42:49.886 --> 01:42:53.075
TALIESIN: Seems fair.

01:42:53.075 --> 01:42:55.449
TRAVIS: Maybe we will--

01:42:55.449 --> 01:42:56.546
TALIESIN: How much money was that amount?

01:42:56.546 --> 01:42:57.292
MARISHA: 65

01:42:57.292 --> 01:42:58.290
TALIESIN: 65, thank you.

01:42:58.290 --> 01:43:03.824
TRAVIS: We'll give you a little lessons in
economics as we travel, just for fucking future

01:43:03.824 --> 01:43:05.048
parley situations.

01:43:05.048 --> 01:43:08.711
TALIESIN: I mean, what's the point of having gold
if you're not using it for something? I mean,

01:43:08.711 --> 01:43:11.970
otherwise it's just something that's making it
heavier to walk.

01:43:11.970 --> 01:43:14.674
TRAVIS: There's a lot of reasons.

01:43:14.674 --> 01:43:18.097
TALIESIN: Sounds odd, but all right.

01:43:18.097 --> 01:43:20.016
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll get into it, we got time.

01:43:20.016 --> 01:43:20.813
LIAM: Seems fake.

01:43:20.813 --> 01:43:24.339
(laughter)

01:43:24.339 --> 01:43:33.235
MATT: As you guys make your way back to the
Nestled Nook Inn, having seen what has become of

01:43:33.235 --> 01:43:39.338
Gustav and changed the trajectory of his journey
as well, you all ruminate on the rather large sum

01:43:39.338 --> 01:43:46.553
of money you've given for what you hope is a good
cause, have another drink, and find your way to

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:47.755
bed. And that's where we'll take a break!

01:43:47.755 --> 01:43:50.293
LAURA: You spent a thousand gold!

01:43:50.293 --> 01:43:57.029
TALIESIN: Worth it! Fucking worth it! I'm feeling
it. I'm feeling the vibe: the vibe was that it was

01:43:57.029 --> 01:43:57.596
worth it.

01:43:57.596 --> 01:44:00.202
MATT: That was really interesting. I wasn't
expecting that!

01:44:00.202 --> 01:44:03.797
TALIESIN: That was, by the way, the best whisper
I've ever had. I'm not telling them at all what

01:44:03.797 --> 01:44:04.988
you said, but that was amazing!

01:44:04.988 --> 01:44:07.117
MATT: That was a 27 insight.

01:44:07.117 --> 01:44:08.353
TRAVIS: We need a damn whisper cam.

01:44:08.353 --> 01:44:09.355
TALIESIN: That was deep.

01:44:09.355 --> 01:44:12.908
SAM: He put 400, 1000, 100.

01:44:12.908 --> 01:44:16.420
MARISHA: I was gonna toss in way more, but you
guys picked up the check.

01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:21.062
TALIESIN: I'm happy to take it. This was
definitely my instigation, so I should bear the

01:44:21.062 --> 01:44:21.954
brunt of it.

01:44:21.954 --> 01:44:29.850
MATT: Fair enough. I had to go to the wiki to find
out how much money he still owed.

01:44:29.850 --> 01:44:31.894
(laughter)

01:44:31.894 --> 01:44:33.204
MATT: So thank you, whoever runs the Critical Role
Wiki.

01:44:33.204 --> 01:44:36.444
LIAM: I'm gonna go open and look at Wikipedia. I
found it!

01:44:36.444 --> 01:44:45.074
MATT: We have tonight as part of our Wyrmwood
giveaway-- ah! Let's open up. Oh! This is the

01:44:45.074 --> 01:44:46.819
purpleheart dice tower.

01:44:46.819 --> 01:44:49.349
SAM: That's mine.

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:55.492
MATT: Which has the Desert of Din'Tely fantastic
grain-in art from Deven Rue.

01:44:55.492 --> 01:44:57.159
LIAM: Looks so good on the purpleheart.

01:44:57.159 --> 01:45:02.084
MATT: Looks so fantastic! It really does. This
dice tower set comes together, magnetizes to

01:45:02.084 --> 01:45:06.163
assemble into an awesome dice tower. This will be
given away at the end of the break to one lucky

01:45:06.163 --> 01:45:10.749
winner. So you need to hop on over to the Critical
Role Twitch chat during the break, that's

01:45:10.749 --> 01:45:20.129
twitch.tv/criticalrole and enter, only once, the
word "coast." C-O-A-S-T. More than once--

01:45:20.129 --> 01:45:21.331
TRAVIS: Deep meaning.

01:45:21.331 --> 01:45:22.112
MATT: I know.

01:45:22.112 --> 01:45:25.961
MATT: More than once and you'll be disqualified.
We'll come back here at the end of the break, and

01:45:25.961 --> 01:45:30.450
we'll have a winner to announce, see you here in a
minute! If I can close the box! There we go!

01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:31.517
TRAVIS: What's in the box?

01:45:31.517 --> 01:45:32.443
MATT: I knew it was coming.

01:45:33.663 --> 01:45:35.489
MATT: Welcome back, and that was super late.

01:45:35.489 --> 01:45:36.638
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Way late!

01:45:36.638 --> 01:45:37.710
LIAM: Intentionally late.

01:45:37.710 --> 01:45:43.357
MATT: Sure. Welcome back. So, first off, we have
our winner. And our winner of the giveaway for

01:45:43.518 --> 01:45:49.293
this fantastic Wyrmwood Purple Heart Box Deven Rue
art scroll thing--

01:45:51.903 --> 01:45:53.822
LIAM: There it is.

01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:59.480
MATT: --is tempyyy. T-E-M-P-Y-Y-Y. Tempyyy,
congratulations, we'll have that sent out to you

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:05.767
ASAP. Well done. We'll have a new one to give you
guys next week for the next giveaway. And thank

01:46:05.767 --> 01:46:08.171
you for our fine friends at Wyrmwood for being
amazing.

01:46:08.171 --> 01:46:09.092
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:46:09.092 --> 01:46:11.233
MATT: All right. Put that away.

01:46:11.233 --> 01:46:12.824
LIAM: I wish Laura hadn't quit.

01:46:12.824 --> 01:46:13.588
MATT: I know.

01:46:13.588 --> 01:46:14.735
TALIESIN: That was weird.

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:16.029
MARISHA: She just was like, "I'm out."

01:46:16.029 --> 01:46:17.584
LIAM: She was so good on the show.

01:46:17.584 --> 01:46:19.140
MARISHA: Right out the front door.

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:21.491
SAM: I'm trying to figure out what it is. Is it
DPB? Is that right?

01:46:21.491 --> 01:46:23.046
MARISHA: DPB, yes.

01:46:23.046 --> 01:46:24.960
MATT: Oh, this is not going away, is it?

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:29.418
SAM: Big peanut butter energy.

01:46:29.418 --> 01:46:34.846
LIAM: We're over big dick energy. BDE is gone, DPB
is in.

01:46:34.846 --> 01:46:38.525
TRAVIS: The best part is when people try to
explain it to other people, and they're like,

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:41.066
"What does it mean?" And they say, "Dick in the
peanut butter," and they'll be like (disbelieving)

01:46:41.066 --> 01:46:44.796
"No, what does it really mean?" It's dick in the
peanut butter.

01:46:45.657 --> 01:46:46.564
MATT: So.

01:46:46.564 --> 01:46:50.480
LIAM: It just means you're really invested.
Schlurp.

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.673
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:46:52.673 --> 01:46:55.538
MATT: So, after taking the evening at--

01:46:55.538 --> 01:46:58.764
(laughter)

01:46:58.764 --> 01:47:04.298
MATT: --in Trostenwald, in the tavern, you rest
up. The following morning, as the sun rises into

01:47:04.298 --> 01:47:09.019
the sky, you have your meals, you prepare
yourselves for the next leg of your journey. Is

01:47:09.019 --> 01:47:11.361
there anything else you wish to accomplish while
in Trostenwald, or do you wish to--

01:47:11.361 --> 01:47:14.000
MARISHA: I do my pushups and my pullups.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.248
MATT: Totally. Got to keep it going. Upkeep, it's
important for a monk.

01:47:17.248 --> 01:47:18.302
MARISHA: I'm working on it.

01:47:18.302 --> 01:47:19.479
TALIESIN: I do my meditation.

01:47:19.479 --> 01:47:20.884
MARISHA: Beau works out more than I do.

01:47:20.884 --> 01:47:23.631
MATT: There you go. Different kind of working
out.

01:47:23.631 --> 01:47:34.031
SAM: Is there a place called Natural Remedies,
maybe? Or maybe the general store? I don't know if

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:41.116
it's possible-- Can I get components to make a
Tanglefoot Bag? The chemicals needed for that?

01:47:41.116 --> 01:47:42.812
MATT: Let's see here.

01:47:44.136 --> 01:47:46.906
SAM: It's a chemical thing, Travis. You wouldn't
understand.

01:47:46.906 --> 01:47:49.860
TRAVIS: Are you pretending to have actually looked
in the Player's Handbook for once?

01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:55.021
SAM: I did not. I looked on the printout that Matt
gave me. The one page that I needed to play the

01:47:55.021 --> 01:47:57.085
game.

01:47:58.530 --> 01:48:04.684
MATT: So yeah. Indeed, there is Natural Remedies,
there is the Lochward General. What are you

01:48:04.684 --> 01:48:06.956
looking for, specifically?

01:48:06.956 --> 01:48:11.292
SAM: What do I need for that, for goopy stuff?
Tar? I don't know.

01:48:11.292 --> 01:48:12.654
MARISHA: Peanut butter.

01:48:12.654 --> 01:48:15.286
MATT: It would be tar and other--

01:48:16.796 --> 01:48:18.630
SAM: Is it a chemical thing?

01:48:18.745 --> 01:48:24.531
MATT: Well, it's a series of chemicals. Tar,
amber, resin, and things that are pulled from tree

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:30.961
sap. There are other processes where you can
distill that down, along with some more crude

01:48:30.961 --> 01:48:36.393
clays, to create this kind of adhesive. If you'd
like to.

01:48:36.393 --> 01:48:42.544
SAM: Yeah, I'll turn into a little gnome or
something, and go around and shop, and get all the

01:48:42.544 --> 01:48:44.745
components I might need.

01:48:44.745 --> 01:48:49.931
MATT: Okay. So you can go ahead and do that. Go
ahead and make a general deception check.

01:48:49.931 --> 01:48:53.168
SAM: Oh boy. Yeah, that's a two.

01:48:53.168 --> 01:48:56.204
MATT: Okay. So you--

01:48:56.204 --> 01:48:59.179
SAM: Oh, but deception's a minus three, so.

01:48:59.179 --> 01:49:00.250
MATT: So negative one?

01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:01.551
SAM: Yes.

01:49:01.551 --> 01:49:02.877
MATT: (laughs)

01:49:02.877 --> 01:49:05.064
TALIESIN: Wow. What does the other side of failure
look like?

01:49:05.064 --> 01:49:07.326
SAM: So, I forget to turn my lower half into a--

01:49:07.326 --> 01:49:09.737
(laughter)

01:49:10.537 --> 01:49:13.477
SAM: Weird minotaur.

01:49:14.202 --> 01:49:18.149
MATT: It's not high stakes here, not high stakes here.

01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:22.425
You go ahead and meet with Simon Earth of
the Natural Remedies shop. You can acquire the

01:49:22.425 --> 01:49:27.471
goods you need at the cost-- specifically, the
materials that you're trying to make if you're

01:49:27.471 --> 01:49:31.149
trying to do something alchemical-- at the cost of
what it requires.

01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:32.674
SAM: Yes!

01:49:32.674 --> 01:49:39.686
MATT: You get through one round of discussions
with him before you begin to notice crownsguard

01:49:39.686 --> 01:49:44.650
getting interested in your presence. One of them,
for some reason, his eye caught you strange and he

01:49:44.650 --> 01:49:52.407
noticed something odd about the illusion and your
physicality and seems to be-- You and this shop

01:49:52.407 --> 01:49:55.350
don't have a very good history.

01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:58.577
TRAVIS: You're half gnome and half minotaur.

01:49:59.677 --> 01:50:02.333
TALIESIN: Just the horse butt on the top.

01:50:03.643 --> 01:50:11.571
SAM: All right, well, I'll just go then, I guess.
Oh! Looks like I've got a thing! Well, I'll come

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:17.730
back tomorrow and finish shopping here, and I will
definitely not flee town today.

01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:20.380
(laughter)

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:25.357
MATT: You say loudly as you exit the facility. The
crownsguard are keeping a distance, but they're

01:50:25.357 --> 01:50:29.049
definitely trailing you from about 25, 30 feet
behind.

01:50:29.049 --> 01:50:36.436
SAM: Boy. It's a cold day. I think I'll just pop
up my hood and walk a little brisker.

01:50:36.436 --> 01:50:39.835
MATT: They walk a little brisker, keeping pace
with you.

01:50:39.835 --> 01:50:44.961
SAM: Maybe just-- Oh look, what's that? And I'll
run into an alley that way.

01:50:44.961 --> 01:50:47.990
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check.

01:50:48.905 --> 01:50:49.927
TALIESIN: Natural one.

01:50:50.824 --> 01:50:56.019
SAM: Advantage. Ooh, that's even worse! 17.

01:50:56.019 --> 01:51:04.281
MATT: 17! Okay. You, dodging into the alleyway,
using what looks like one of the open window sills

01:51:04.281 --> 01:51:10.322
on the first floor and the edge railing of the
rooftop of this building that's immediately there,

01:51:10.322 --> 01:51:16.349
you dart up and manage to get your small goblin
form up onto the roof, out of the point of view.

01:51:16.349 --> 01:51:20.788
You hear the crownsguard round the corner and run
inside and begin looking around. You see them

01:51:20.788 --> 01:51:25.763
pushing barrels over, and one of them who seems to
be leading this charge is like, "Well, fucking

01:51:25.763 --> 01:51:33.263
hell, where the hell did she go? It's probably
just my brain playing tricks on me." And you hear

01:51:33.501 --> 01:51:37.509
them slowly walk away. They weren't fully invested
in a chase. They were more just mistrusting and

01:51:37.509 --> 01:51:38.770
curious.

01:51:38.958 --> 01:51:40.328
TRAVIS: (whispers) Kill them now.

01:51:40.328 --> 01:51:43.158
(laughter)

01:51:43.158 --> 01:51:44.916
SAM: It would be so easy.

01:51:45.536 --> 01:51:47.908
TALIESIN: (whispers) Their families must know
pain.

01:51:47.908 --> 01:51:49.824
SAM: All right. I'll just rejoin the others.

01:51:49.824 --> 01:51:52.407
MATT: So you're back with the rest of the troupe.
You guys have all your stuff gathered together to

01:51:52.407 --> 01:51:58.516
continue the rest of this journey. If you want to
do anything alchemical, it will take time with the

01:51:58.516 --> 01:52:00.162
kit to do so.

01:52:00.162 --> 01:52:02.378
SAM: The dice have spoken, Matt.

01:52:03.136 --> 01:52:07.260
MATT: So! Gathered up, back onto the cart, who is
leading this next leg of the journey? Is it

01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:08.680
continuing, Caduceus?

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:13.383
TALIESIN: I'm really enjoying this. I get to see
this wonderful countryside.

01:52:13.383 --> 01:52:14.686
MARISHA: I'll drive for a bit.

01:52:14.686 --> 01:52:15.857
TALIESIN: Sure.

01:52:15.857 --> 01:52:17.763
MARISHA: I haven't taken a shift yet.

01:52:17.763 --> 01:52:21.526
MATT: All right, so the two of you make your way
to the front of the cart, and get heading

01:52:21.526 --> 01:52:24.610
southward. It is four days of travel to the Wuyun
Gate.

01:52:24.610 --> 01:52:25.825
MARISHA: To the what gate?

01:52:25.825 --> 01:52:29.925
MATT: To the Wuyun Gate. It's the southern gates
that mark the very edge of the southern portion of

01:52:29.925 --> 01:52:36.413
the Empire. So. Go ahead and make a perception
check. Since Beau is helping you, with advantage.

01:52:38.833 --> 01:52:39.825
TALIESIN: 19.

01:52:40.912 --> 01:52:47.674
MATT: 19, okay. We'll say, for the sake of brevity
here, the first two days of travel, thanks to your

01:52:47.674 --> 01:52:54.286
tent as well and staying off the beaten path
during times of rest, you manage to find some good

01:52:54.286 --> 01:53:00.910
hidden areas and no issues happen at night during
the restful period. The second day goes by without

01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:09.016
issue. You do see a small grouping of merchants
making their way northward with largely what is a

01:53:09.016 --> 01:53:16.234
chain of oxen. It looks like they have about 12 or
so of them that are chained together and they're

01:53:16.234 --> 01:53:23.308
heading northward, having made their way through
the gates, for some sort of a sale or trade. It's

01:53:23.308 --> 01:53:30.484
a curious spectacle as they come by. It's one cart
and just a lot of oxen, giant horns, slowly making

01:53:30.484 --> 01:53:35.541
their way northward. As you pass around for the
third day and fourth day, go ahead and make

01:53:35.541 --> 01:53:37.472
another perception check.

01:53:37.472 --> 01:53:38.730
TALIESIN: Again with advantage?

01:53:38.730 --> 01:53:39.539
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:53:39.539 --> 01:53:40.937
TALIESIN: All right.

01:53:43.014 --> 01:53:44.460
Natural 20.

01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:45.530
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:46.686
MATT: Damn!

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:47.699
TALIESIN: Rocking it today.

01:53:47.699 --> 01:53:50.415
MATT: Apparently. Which brings you to a total of?

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:51.982
TALIESIN: 28.

01:53:51.982 --> 01:53:56.036
MATT: 28. Okay.

01:53:56.036 --> 01:54:01.754
MARISHA: Geocache! Geocache! Geocache! More hidden
treasure!

01:54:01.754 --> 01:54:08.976
MATT: As you get to the very, very southern side
of this valley, you begin to see as the Cyrios

01:54:08.976 --> 01:54:18.231
Mountains and the Ashkeeper Peaks begin to come
and point together towards the actual Wuyun Gorge,

01:54:18.231 --> 01:54:23.622
which is this central ravine between the two
mountain ranges that heads southward and exits the

01:54:23.622 --> 01:54:28.962
Marrow Valley entirely. As you approach, you begin
to see the actual Wuyun Gates, which are these

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:35.816
tall 50 foot high--- can't quite tell the width of
it. You've traveled through these before once with

01:54:35.816 --> 01:54:40.644
Jester before coming into the Empire. You know the
width of these walls is at least ten feet to 15

01:54:40.644 --> 01:54:46.949
feet wide at its base. The central gates
themselves are not stone, but they are two very

01:54:46.949 --> 01:54:52.906
large, iron reinforced wooden doors that stand
about 20 feet tall and are opened and closed by

01:54:52.906 --> 01:55:01.218
chained based wenches that rotate and open and
close from each side of the interior of the wall.

01:55:01.218 --> 01:55:13.510
Your vision catches a troupe of about 50 or so
soldiers. Not dressed in the same bits of armor as

01:55:13.727 --> 01:55:17.415
the crownsguard that you've seen as you've
traversed most of this countryside, but a

01:55:17.415 --> 01:55:24.632
different set of armor. Largely bright red maroons
and golds. Looks like there are some tents and

01:55:24.632 --> 01:55:29.926
there's an encampment set on this side, off to the
eastern edge of the gate.

01:55:32.262 --> 01:55:35.543
TALIESIN: Mr. Fjord, what do you think of that?

01:55:35.543 --> 01:55:40.687
TRAVIS: To be honest with you, Caduceus, that was
not here the last time I was here.

01:55:40.687 --> 01:55:43.185
TALIESIN: Do you recognize those uniforms?

01:55:43.643 --> 01:55:45.476
MATT: They are the Righteous Brand.

01:55:45.476 --> 01:55:51.219
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're the Righteous Brand. I
remember maybe a tenth of that. I assume border

01:55:51.219 --> 01:55:54.284
tensions are pretty high.

01:55:54.284 --> 01:55:56.919
TALIESIN: Are we okay with these people or should
we--

01:55:56.919 --> 01:56:00.766
TRAVIS: I think we should be fine. After all,
we're leaving, we're not entering.

01:56:00.766 --> 01:56:02.439
TALIESIN: Fair.

01:56:03.396 --> 01:56:10.302
MATT: As you guys get closer and closer to the
gates, you can see six crownsguard that are

01:56:10.302 --> 01:56:19.901
painstakingly inspecting every cart and travel
wagon that is making its way through the gate.

01:56:19.901 --> 01:56:24.349
They are stopping one by one and going through and
poking and prodding and moving things in the carts

01:56:24.349 --> 01:56:30.233
to look for any stowaways; looking for hidden
materials. In this time of warfare, it looks like

01:56:30.233 --> 01:56:34.133
there is a very thorough process. And you can see
the gates are open--

01:56:34.133 --> 01:56:35.814
LIAM: How far to the gate?

01:56:35.814 --> 01:56:41.090
MATT: You guys are about 300 feet away. He caught
a vision of it very distantly and you guys are--

01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:44.812
They haven't quite noticed your presence yet or if
they've noticed it, they haven't taken stock of it

01:56:44.812 --> 01:56:47.111
because they're focused on their task.

01:56:47.111 --> 01:56:49.592
TRAVIS: We've traveled four days to the south to
the Wuyun Gates.

01:56:49.798 --> 01:56:51.452
SAM: And we're about to get--

01:56:51.452 --> 01:56:52.876
MARISHA: Border patrol.

01:56:52.876 --> 01:56:55.086
SAM: Border patrol's there and they're checking
every wagon.

01:56:55.086 --> 01:56:57.773
TRAVIS: You and I came through when we were coming
north and there were a couple guards. Now there's

01:56:57.773 --> 01:56:58.923
like 50.

01:56:58.923 --> 01:57:01.455
LIAM: It needs to be empty the way it looks. We
need to hop out now.

01:57:01.455 --> 01:57:05.738
MARISHA: Yeah. Caduceus let's pull off to the side
and try to find some cover in the woods. Is there

01:57:05.738 --> 01:57:07.159
woods to cover behind?

01:57:07.159 --> 01:57:08.426
MATT: Nope! It is--

01:57:08.426 --> 01:57:09.927
MARISHA: It's a gorge?

01:57:09.927 --> 01:57:15.898
MATT: Well, the mountain range has come together
into this central gorge. What was previously tall

01:57:15.898 --> 01:57:21.708
grass plains with rolling hills and bits of rock
has thinned out to be bits of scrub and then hard

01:57:21.708 --> 01:57:27.974
rock floor. You've left the central valley and
you're hitting more mountainous terrain.

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:31.923
TRAVIS: Perhaps we empty the cart, walk on foot
and say we're looking to go out and bring goods

01:57:31.923 --> 01:57:34.619
and wares back into the Empire.

01:57:34.619 --> 01:57:38.891
MARISHA: I just don't want to bring a cart with a
magical tarp over it, that's designed for

01:57:38.891 --> 01:57:40.787
smuggling humans.

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:44.091
LAURA: Well, the tarp isn't magical. The cart is
magical.

01:57:44.091 --> 01:57:46.198
TALIESIN: Is there a way to turn off the effect?

01:57:46.198 --> 01:57:47.798
LAURA: It just looks like a cart.

01:57:47.798 --> 01:57:52.043
LIAM: It needs to be empty the way it looks when
they poke at it. So I think we should all spill

01:57:52.043 --> 01:57:53.400
out now.

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:56.111
MARISHA: We'll walk outside? Yeah.

01:57:56.111 --> 01:57:59.575
TALIESIN: There's got to be a way to turn off the
enchantment, maybe.

01:57:59.575 --> 01:58:02.378
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:58:04.203 --> 01:58:05.730
SAM: Is there a button?

01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:09.465
TALIESIN: I'm probably not the person the make an
arcana check for this, but here we go.

01:58:09.465 --> 01:58:11.395
MATT: You're the one who had the question.

01:58:11.395 --> 01:58:14.787
TALIESIN: Nope. That is a natural one. Which gives
me a zero.

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:19.669
MATT: You contemplate over this enchantment that
they've told you about the cart. You guys watch as

01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:24.954
Caduceus stares out into space a bit before this
trickle of blood begins to come of his nostril.

01:58:26.644 --> 01:58:28.063
LAURA: Are you okay?

01:58:28.302 --> 01:58:29.545
TALIESIN: What?

01:58:29.545 --> 01:58:31.356
TRAVIS: Caduceus, you've got a little--

01:58:31.356 --> 01:58:32.623
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. That's--

01:58:32.623 --> 01:58:34.142
LAURA: Does that happen when you think really
hard?

01:58:34.142 --> 01:58:35.528
TALIESIN: What?

01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:39.567
LIAM: Just on a whim do you want to try to dispel
the enchantment the way you did--

01:58:39.567 --> 01:58:41.209
SAM: Dispel? But then it won't come back!

01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:42.664
LAURA: But then it won't work!

01:58:42.664 --> 01:58:44.361
TALIESIN: It may not come back is the thought.

01:58:44.361 --> 01:58:46.013
MARISHA: Yeah. I kind of like having--

01:58:46.013 --> 01:58:47.377
LAURA: I have Dispel Magic, but--

01:58:47.377 --> 01:58:52.003
LIAM: What would I know about using that spell to
make this go away; temporarily or for good?

01:58:52.003 --> 01:58:54.959
MATT: It's hard to-- Make an arcana check
yourself, actually.

01:58:55.894 --> 01:59:02.357
LIAM: That's what I'm after. That is 22.

01:59:02.357 --> 01:59:07.825
MATT: It depends on the basis of the enchantment.
If they're very powerful items, then there are

01:59:07.825 --> 01:59:13.692
sometimes means of temporarily subduing the
enchantment. Objects that are a little more

01:59:13.692 --> 01:59:23.799
common, or the enchantments themselves are not as
thorough, it is a dispel and gone type scenario.

01:59:23.799 --> 01:59:25.725
LIAM: Hey, let's roll off of this thing and take a
walk.

01:59:25.725 --> 01:59:26.958
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:59:26.958 --> 01:59:32.366
SAM: How about this? What about this? There's--
we're not the only cart on the road, right?

01:59:32.366 --> 01:59:37.002
MATT: On this side of the road? You're the only
one. There is one that is in the gates right now

01:59:37.002 --> 01:59:40.844
that's full inspection, and you can now see, from
this distance that Caduceus has pointed out,

01:59:40.844 --> 01:59:45.557
beyond the open gates, you can see a cluster of
other carts. There's a line trying to make their way--

01:59:45.693 --> 01:59:50.896
SAM: Waiting to come back through. We could plant
some contraband on one of those carts. In the

01:59:50.896 --> 01:59:55.499
kerfuffle, they'll be like, "Hey, you! You guys
are arrested, you're under arrest!" And we'll be

01:59:55.499 --> 01:59:57.771
like, "Oh, we'll just skate through."

01:59:57.771 --> 02:00:00.802
LAURA: I don't think they're trying to arrest
people on the way out.

02:00:00.802 --> 02:00:02.902
TRAVIS: They are searching both ways, it looks
like.

02:00:02.902 --> 02:00:06.046
LAURA: I think it will be easier to get out of the
Empire than back in.

02:00:06.046 --> 02:00:08.162
LIAM: Let them poke sticks in here and find
nothing.

02:00:08.162 --> 02:00:10.057
MARISHA: Do you think we're okay if we all pile
out?

02:00:10.057 --> 02:00:12.501
SAM: If they poke the stick in, the stick will
disappear.

02:00:12.501 --> 02:00:15.419
TRAVIS: What kind of contraband do we have? We've
got a couple pouches of fungus and that's about it.

02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:16.912
MARISHA: That's true.

02:00:16.912 --> 02:00:18.953
SAM: I have human jerky.

02:00:18.953 --> 02:00:20.556
LAURA: They won't know that it's human.

02:00:20.556 --> 02:00:22.310
SAM: If I tell them it is--

02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:24.119
LAURA: How about don't do that.

02:00:24.119 --> 02:00:27.798
LIAM: Yeah, but if they find the lot of us going
(grunts) when they look in, that's bad, but if

02:00:27.798 --> 02:00:32.778
they poke at it and say, "What's with this cart?",
we say it's a very good cart.

02:00:32.778 --> 02:00:35.211
TRAVIS: I agree. Let's risk it.

02:00:35.236 --> 02:00:36.236
SAM: Okay.

02:00:36.261 --> 02:00:38.205
LIAM: I'm getting out of the cart.

02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:40.045
LAURA: Yeah, all of us.

02:00:40.045 --> 02:00:46.158
MARISHA: If they reached in to be like, "Oh, are
there hidden compartments?", would they see their

02:00:46.158 --> 02:00:47.680
arm disappear?

02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:51.345
MATT: Their arm would essentially vanish as they
put their arm through the illusion.

02:00:51.345 --> 02:00:55.013
MARISHA: Or if they're like, "I'm going to climb
up and check this out, Frank," and then they're

02:00:55.013 --> 02:00:56.592
like, "Frank!"

02:00:56.592 --> 02:01:00.738
LAURA: The cart isn't covered. Let's just make it
look totally empty.

02:01:00.738 --> 02:01:04.729
SAM: And if they ask why there's nothing, we have
a story, right? We're going to go pick up a

02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:06.748
shipment and bring it back.

02:01:06.748 --> 02:01:08.299
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine.

02:01:08.299 --> 02:01:10.414
TRAVIS: Nothing wrong with having an invisible
cart.

02:01:10.414 --> 02:01:12.524
SAM: Just me. I'll do the talking, right?

02:01:12.524 --> 02:01:14.139
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:01:14.139 --> 02:01:17.081
LIAM: Or maybe Fjord would be good at that.

02:01:17.081 --> 02:01:19.398
LAURA: I'm going to focus on the thing.

02:01:19.398 --> 02:01:21.779
TRAVIS: Oh, the dodeca?

02:01:21.779 --> 02:01:22.955
SAM: Shouldn't Fjord?

02:01:22.955 --> 02:01:24.653
TRAVIS: Shouldn't I, since I've never done it
before?

02:01:24.653 --> 02:01:27.271
TALIESIN: Yeah, actually, I was going to say, you
haven't done it yet. I think that--

02:01:27.271 --> 02:01:31.326
LAURA: Okay, Fjord, you focus on it. Right as I
started to focus on it, you can steal it from me.

02:01:31.326 --> 02:01:34.928
LIAM: I will take the bag away and swivel it over
to Fjord.

02:01:34.928 --> 02:01:37.922
TRAVIS: But I don't underst-- (groans)

02:01:37.922 --> 02:01:41.254
(laughter)

02:01:41.254 --> 02:01:43.836
MATT: In that brief moment, Fjord--

02:01:43.836 --> 02:01:45.856
MARISHA: Oh shit, maybe she will come to him.

02:01:45.856 --> 02:01:58.549
MATT: --you feel this momentary release, like a
tether that previously had gone unseen is

02:01:58.549 --> 02:02:05.793
loosened. And there, in that brief bit of
unexpected free-floating freedom amongst the

02:02:05.793 --> 02:02:14.066
darkness, that warm, gray, centered energy drifts
towards you. Your fight-or-flight kicks in

02:02:14.066 --> 02:02:20.011
momentarily, but you consciously recall that your
friends have been through this. Seems safe. And

02:02:20.011 --> 02:02:24.910
with that, it drifts towards you, and, in this
weird, familiar sense, you've had more than one

02:02:24.910 --> 02:02:32.402
object just enter your torso. As it warmly touches your
chest and dissipates within the inside of your

02:02:32.542 --> 02:02:39.664
body, your consciousness shifts back out of your
concentration mode on the dodecahedron, and you

02:02:39.664 --> 02:02:46.542
can feel that lingering warmth still around your
sternum beneath your armor as you release your

02:02:46.542 --> 02:02:48.662
hands from the object.

02:02:49.067 --> 02:02:50.724
TRAVIS: That's a hell of a thing.

02:02:50.724 --> 02:02:52.342
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:02:52.342 --> 02:03:00.751
TRAVIS: Calm yourself, Jester. Lock it up. Lock it
up. Mount up, let's do this.

02:03:00.751 --> 02:03:02.926
MATT: All right.

02:03:02.926 --> 02:03:06.937
LAURA: By mount up, he means everybody walk next
to the cart.

02:03:08.082 --> 02:03:18.777
MATT: So, as you all-- Walking alongside your cart
towards the Wuyun Gates, the crownsguard begin to

02:03:18.777 --> 02:03:23.783
take notice of your presence, and you can see the
one cart that was being inspected at the gates is

02:03:23.783 --> 02:03:28.723
given, apparently, the clear. They load their
materials back into it and begin making their way

02:03:28.723 --> 02:03:33.056
northward, passing you as you head south.

02:03:33.056 --> 02:03:36.122
SAM: I'm going to change into another form of some
sort.

02:03:36.122 --> 02:03:37.634
MATT: Of which sort?

02:03:37.634 --> 02:03:41.224
SAM: Just a halfling. Or a tiny halfling lady.

02:03:41.224 --> 02:03:44.585
MATT: You begin to hit a point-- and there's
enough room for maybe three carts to make it

02:03:44.585 --> 02:03:50.158
through here, but they're keeping it a two-lane
scenario here, this pincher point. There is a cart

02:03:50.158 --> 02:03:54.405
now that's begun inspection, and about three
different crownsguard are going through and

02:03:54.405 --> 02:03:59.128
rifling and lifting things out of the way. As you
begin to approach, the crownsguard put a hand up

02:03:59.128 --> 02:04:03.010
and guide you over with hand signals to the area
to the immediate right of it, around ten feet to

02:04:03.010 --> 02:04:12.714
the west of the other cart. The captain
approaches. You can see a woman in brownish red

02:04:12.714 --> 02:04:20.865
hair, a bit sun-bleached at the tips, pulled up
into a soft ponytail high on the head, and the

02:04:20.865 --> 02:04:25.304
crownsguard armor itself looks well-kept. You can
see from the decorations, as you've seen it

02:04:25.304 --> 02:04:33.529
before, this is a captain. Approaches. "Halt. What
is your business, and where are you going?"

02:04:33.529 --> 02:04:37.949
TRAVIS: We are but merchants heading south, down
to Nicodranas and Port Damali, in search of goods

02:04:37.949 --> 02:04:39.443
and wares.

02:04:40.647 --> 02:04:45.015
MATT: "Very well. And what are you carrying across
the border, please?"

02:04:45.015 --> 02:04:51.629
TRAVIS: Nothing but this cart. We are full of coin
and yet have no products for trade. We hope to fix

02:04:51.629 --> 02:04:54.868
that south of the border.

02:04:55.206 --> 02:05:01.317
MATT: (whistles) Two of the crownsguard come over
towards the cart and goes, "But what is within

02:05:01.317 --> 02:05:04.922
these sacks and small boxes?"

02:05:04.922 --> 02:05:07.455
LAURA: Oh no, we totally emptied the cart.

02:05:07.455 --> 02:05:12.532
MATT: You emptied the cart, but the illusion--
I've explained multiple times-- is an illusion of

02:05:12.532 --> 02:05:15.451
standard sacks and boxes.

02:05:15.451 --> 02:05:19.156
MARISHA: What if none of us fully understood
that?

02:05:19.156 --> 02:05:20.900
LAURA: Like, at all.

02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:21.930
TALIESIN: I did.

02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:23.443
LAURA: I did not.

02:05:23.443 --> 02:05:24.670
TALIESIN: May I?

02:05:24.670 --> 02:05:26.370
LAURA: Yes.

02:05:26.370 --> 02:05:31.714
TALIESIN: There's actually nothing on the cart.
This is a preventative measure against theft. You

02:05:31.714 --> 02:05:34.985
can feel free to inspect the cart yourself, if you
like.

02:05:35.625 --> 02:05:37.482
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:05:39.556 --> 02:05:40.922
SAM: So truthful.

02:05:40.922 --> 02:05:42.301
MARISHA: I know.

02:05:42.555 --> 02:05:43.527
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:05:43.527 --> 02:05:50.530
MATT: "All right. Appreciate you being
forthright." The two other guards come forward,

02:05:50.530 --> 02:05:54.551
and you watch as they place their blades into and
watch them vanish and go like--

02:05:56.751 --> 02:05:58.453
TALIESIN: It's kind of neat, right?

02:05:58.453 --> 02:06:01.761
MATT: Looking back at the captain, and begin to
poke forward, and you watch as their torsos vanish

02:06:01.761 --> 02:06:12.798
beyond the veil of the illusion, and pull back.
"Dualla!" The captain approaches, and herself

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:22.353
leans in and pulls back. "You are not incorrect,
you carry nothing on your carts. This is a curious

02:06:22.353 --> 02:06:31.432
nature of an enchantment, indeed. And you said
you're heading to Nicodranas and Port Damali to

02:06:31.432 --> 02:06:34.390
acquire goods. What are you looking to acquire?"

02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:39.668
TRAVIS: Some simple fabrics, meats. My friends
haven't sampled the cuisine down there, and I was

02:06:39.668 --> 02:06:42.870
hoping to show them a bit of the Menagerie Coast.

02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:44.861
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:50.459
TRAVIS: Ugh!

02:06:50.459 --> 02:06:52.231
LAURA: If it's really bad, you can roll again!

02:06:52.231 --> 02:06:56.732
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, I'm going to do that!
That's better. 17.

02:06:59.962 --> 02:07:06.591
MATT: She gives you a close look, not leaving
direct eyeline to your pupils and hers, and

02:07:07.083 --> 02:07:15.841
watches you through the entire statement, and
then, "Very well. Move along."

02:07:15.841 --> 02:07:18.092
TALIESIN: We look forward to seeing you on our
return.

02:07:18.092 --> 02:07:20.663
MATT: "Well, the inspection will be far more
thorough that time."

02:07:20.663 --> 02:07:24.089
TALIESIN: Oh, I figure we're not difficult faces
to remember.

02:07:24.089 --> 02:07:26.078
MATT: "All right. Stay safe."

02:07:26.078 --> 02:07:27.591
TALIESIN: You too.

02:07:27.591 --> 02:07:33.664
MATT: "The boundaries-- who knows what's wandering
from the dark side of Xhorhas there? Eyes on your

02:07:33.664 --> 02:07:40.902
backs. Go!" And the crownsguard pull away, and the
ones on the opposite end open the space for you

02:07:40.902 --> 02:07:45.984
guys to move your cart along. With that, you pass
through the gates of the Wuyun Gorge.

02:07:45.984 --> 02:07:49.560
TRAVIS: Do the gates look any different since the
last time we were there? Scratch marks? More wear

02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:51.432
and tear?

02:07:51.432 --> 02:07:53.528
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:07:53.528 --> 02:07:55.970
MARISHA: You're like the one happy person at the
DMV.

02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:57.645
TALIESIN: (laughs)

02:07:57.645 --> 02:07:59.066
TRAVIS: 19.

02:07:59.066 --> 02:08:03.197
MATT: No. It doesn't look like there's been any
scuffle, no attacks, they haven't taken any tear

02:08:03.197 --> 02:08:11.206
from any sort of conflict, it looks like, from
this end. But there are more guards up along the

02:08:11.206 --> 02:08:18.319
top, along the walkway above the wall. Previously,
you guys had seen two crossbowmen that were there.

02:08:18.319 --> 02:08:25.019
There's now ten. The Righteous Brand themselves,
while about 30 or so of them have been encamped in

02:08:25.019 --> 02:08:29.890
that one encampment, the rest, of about 20 or so,
are scattered amongst different points on the

02:08:29.890 --> 02:08:34.441
mountains around the gate and are all scouts,
keeping eyes out for anyone trying to circumvent

02:08:34.441 --> 02:08:43.143
the pinch point. There's pretty heavy interest in
keeping watch on these borders, given the current

02:08:43.143 --> 02:08:50.056
conflict to the east. But you pass through safely,
allowed by the crownsguard, and within a few

02:08:50.056 --> 02:09:02.834
moments, you pass into the Wuyun Gorge proper, and
a wave of acknowledgement hits most of you that,

02:09:02.834 --> 02:09:15.090
for the first time, you are no longer in the
Dwendalian Empire. So you pass by the six or seven

02:09:15.090 --> 02:09:21.219
carts that are in line, and there's arguments and
frustration. Some of them are currently very

02:09:21.219 --> 02:09:26.191
vehemently arguing with the crownsguard who are
holding them to wait their turn. You keep your

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:31.429
heads down and continue forward. There, you start
heading into this large mountain pass. Extremely

02:09:31.429 --> 02:09:37.911
steep at certain points, where the mountains seem
to be have been carved down or bisected by some

02:09:37.911 --> 02:09:46.463
ancient cataclysm, whether it be the Calamity or
some great natural disaster long before that. It

02:09:46.463 --> 02:09:54.623
seems to be a very unique, singular cleft down in
the center of these two mountains that breaks the

02:09:54.623 --> 02:10:01.386
mountain range between the Cyrios and the
Ashkeeper. Who's keeping-- you're at the front of this?

02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:02.519
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:10:02.519 --> 02:10:04.613
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check for me,
please.

02:10:05.011 --> 02:10:06.490
TALIESIN: No advantage.

02:10:06.490 --> 02:10:09.860
SAM: Come on, Deuce. Drop that deuce.

02:10:10.234 --> 02:10:11.921
TALIESIN: That's a 27.

02:10:11.921 --> 02:10:13.423
LIAM: He did it again.

02:10:13.423 --> 02:10:15.539
TALIESIN: I am rocking today.

02:10:15.539 --> 02:10:24.039
MATT: As you're stalking ahead, riding before, you
can see there's bits of rock formations that have

02:10:24.039 --> 02:10:28.564
been pushed through by some sort of ancient
seismic activity. There are pieces of rock that

02:10:28.564 --> 02:10:34.344
are platformed over, and there are outcroppings
and caverns that have naturally been pushed out of

02:10:34.344 --> 02:10:41.161
the sides of this large ravine. It's quiet here,
with the occasional echoing sound of birds

02:10:41.161 --> 02:10:47.542
squawking and cawing to each other. There's a
faint wind occasionally drifting through in

02:10:47.542 --> 02:10:55.768
pulses. It's warm. The sun is above, and whereas
previously you have been encountering the colder

02:10:55.768 --> 02:11:00.611
winter, especially further north of the Marrow
Valley where the snowfalls have been rather

02:11:00.611 --> 02:11:07.554
consistent, the warm clothes that many of you have
been wearing in that weather are beginning to

02:11:07.554 --> 02:11:13.805
capture the heat of this southern area, and as the
sun is now high in the sky, cloudless, the blue

02:11:13.805 --> 02:11:20.726
above you, the beads of sweat begin to form across
your back beneath your clothing. Caduceus, you

02:11:20.726 --> 02:11:28.465
hear this faint, guttural muttering of some kind.
What languages do you know?

02:11:28.465 --> 02:11:33.655
TALIESIN: I know Common, Elvish, Giant, Sylvan.

02:11:34.412 --> 02:11:36.329
MATT: (laughs)

02:11:36.329 --> 02:11:38.614
SAM: More whispers?

02:11:38.614 --> 02:11:40.597
LAURA: Ah, he knows everything!

02:11:40.597 --> 02:11:42.545
LIAM: It's an elven giant.

02:11:42.545 --> 02:11:43.663
TRAVIS: Buddy.

02:11:43.663 --> 02:11:45.388
MARISHA: Caduceus MVP tonight.

02:11:45.388 --> 02:11:47.266
SAM: Wow, he's on a roll.

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:49.300
TRAVIS: May this carry you into the playa well, my
friend.

02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:50.754
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:11:53.662 --> 02:11:57.662
SAM: What was that? I heard some of the whisper. I
heard it was crazy!

02:11:58.752 --> 02:12:00.149
LAURA: What?

02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:02.597
TALIESIN: There's giants up ahead.

02:12:02.597 --> 02:12:03.636
LIAM and MARISHA: What?

02:12:03.636 --> 02:12:04.828
SAM: What do you mean?

02:12:04.828 --> 02:12:05.701
LAURA: Where up ahead?

02:12:05.701 --> 02:12:06.551
TALIESIN: Shh.

02:12:06.551 --> 02:12:07.823
SAM: You didn't tell me we were going to giant--

02:12:07.823 --> 02:12:09.351
TRAVIS: Shh!

02:12:09.351 --> 02:12:12.356
LAURA: Get back in the cart! Get in the cart!

02:12:12.356 --> 02:12:20.652
TALIESIN: All right. Do I know where the voice
came from?

02:12:20.652 --> 02:12:26.781
MATT: With that roll? Yes, you would. Looking
ahead-- and you guys have traveled a number of

02:12:26.781 --> 02:12:38.651
hours past the gates-- about 30 feet ahead of you,
behind one of these rock formations, you can see

02:12:38.651 --> 02:12:43.891
the vague outline of some sort of large, hulking
figure leaned against it.

02:12:43.891 --> 02:12:45.625
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:12:45.625 --> 02:12:52.858
MATT: You see the outside of a humanoid shoulder
and the back of a matted bit of greased hair,

02:12:52.858 --> 02:12:56.354
maybe standing 15 feet tall.

02:12:58.114 --> 02:12:59.497
TALIESIN: All right.

02:13:00.833 --> 02:13:02.363
LAURA: What is it?

02:13:02.363 --> 02:13:04.685
TALIESIN: It's about 30 feet away?

02:13:04.685 --> 02:13:07.336
MATT: It's about 30 feet ahead of you and to the
right.

02:13:07.336 --> 02:13:12.202
TALIESIN: All right. I think he's planning on
ambushing us.

02:13:12.202 --> 02:13:13.450
SAM: What?

02:13:13.450 --> 02:13:14.424
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast--

02:13:14.424 --> 02:13:15.632
LAURA: Just one?

02:13:15.632 --> 02:13:17.736
TALIESIN: Just one I can see, although he's
talking to someone-- I'm going to cast Calm

02:13:17.736 --> 02:13:20.721
Emotions over there just to see what that does.

02:13:20.721 --> 02:13:22.190
MATT: Okay.

02:13:22.190 --> 02:13:26.063
MARISHA: Just a little chamomile. It's calming. A little
lavender.

02:13:26.429 --> 02:13:29.953
TALIESIN: It's a 20-foot bomb in all that section
I can't see.

02:13:29.953 --> 02:13:31.915
MATT: Yep. So it's a charisma saving throw.

02:13:31.915 --> 02:13:33.643
TALIESIN: Against 16.

02:13:34.448 --> 02:13:39.182
MATT: It's a natural five with a minus one. That's
going to be a no.

02:13:39.182 --> 02:13:40.863
TRAVIS: Atta boy.

02:13:40.863 --> 02:13:42.769
LIAM: Nice, Tal.

02:13:43.443 --> 02:13:45.700
LAURA: Who's this Tal you speak of?

02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:51.398
MATT: The tension-- and you guys can, as Caduceus
has pointed out this figure, you can see it tense

02:13:51.398 --> 02:13:59.783
against the stone, and you see it was reaching
down. Just out of sight, there was some large

02:13:59.783 --> 02:14:06.213
rocky formation that it had its arms on, and it
leans back a bit and shakes its head, and as it

02:14:06.213 --> 02:14:12.979
pulls just beyond the outline of the rock, you can
see a second head right next to the first. Two

02:14:12.979 --> 02:14:17.601
heads on one set of shoulders. They both shake
away from each other, then together and away, and

02:14:17.601 --> 02:14:25.351
one looks to the other and just waves in your
direction.

02:14:25.351 --> 02:14:27.403
TALIESIN: What are they wearing?

02:14:27.403 --> 02:14:33.280
MATT: Mostly no clothing other than a bit of
tattered leather and hide and furs that are matted

02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:37.138
around the midsection and dangling almost past the
knees.

02:14:37.138 --> 02:14:42.944
TALIESIN: I'm just going to calmly keep moving the
cart by them, and I'm just going to wave back and

02:14:42.944 --> 02:14:46.923
say, "That's some great leather you're wearing
there. You look great."

02:14:47.247 --> 02:14:49.396
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding me?

02:14:49.396 --> 02:14:50.770
MARISHA: Holy shit.

02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:56.847
MATT: As the cart moves past, another voice, also
in giant, comes across the way. You guys hear:

02:14:56.847 --> 02:15:03.385
(yelling in Giant). You look over to the other
side, and from around another rock, you see

02:15:03.385 --> 02:15:12.842
another one of them who's looking livid at the
other one. Go ahead and make an arcan-- this would

02:15:12.842 --> 02:15:16.100
be-- technically, it's a giant--

02:15:16.110 --> 02:15:19.388
TALIESIN: They also don't see any of you. They
just see me and whoever's sitting up front right now.

02:15:19.388 --> 02:15:20.942
MATT: Make a general intelligence check.

02:15:20.942 --> 02:15:23.994
LAURA: Oh, that's right, it's just you. I think
all of us jumped in the back.

02:15:24.901 --> 02:15:27.030
MATT: If anybody would like to, make a general
intelligence check on this.

02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:27.972
LIAM: 23.

02:15:27.972 --> 02:15:29.201
SAM: Or just him.

02:15:29.201 --> 02:15:30.184
MARISHA: General intelligence?

02:15:30.184 --> 02:15:31.818
MATT: Yeah, these are Ettins.

02:15:31.818 --> 02:15:32.725
TRAVIS: That worked. They're what?

02:15:32.725 --> 02:15:39.446
MATT: Ettins are large giant-kin, two-headed
beasts, and they don't normally work in pairs--

02:15:39.446 --> 02:15:44.030
you know this instinctively-- because they argue
enough between their two heads. To have two

02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:48.254
working together is already a very strained
relationship. And the other one who's yelling at

02:15:48.254 --> 02:15:55.806
the one across the way, as you guys are in
between, you recognize it as saying, "What?! Why?!

02:15:55.806 --> 02:16:05.218
Stupid! Right there! Don't wave!" And the other
head goes, "What he said!" I'm going to go ahead

02:16:05.218 --> 02:16:07.828
and, just for the sake of this, to give you some
visual perspective--

02:16:07.828 --> 02:16:09.599
TALIESIN: Yeah, please, bring it. I feel bad that
we didn't get to--

02:16:09.599 --> 02:16:11.370
MATT: It may not come to that, but I want to give
you a visual.

02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:13.502
TALIESIN: I feel like-- if you worked so hard on a
map, I was feeling a little guilty.

02:16:13.502 --> 02:16:17.417
SAM: Matt made this map, and you just blew it,
Taliesin.

02:16:17.417 --> 02:16:22.213
TALIESIN: I am enjoying this character so much.

02:16:22.213 --> 02:16:24.896
LAURA: Oh my god, look at how amazing that map
is!

02:16:24.896 --> 02:16:26.630
SAM: There's so much in there.

02:16:26.630 --> 02:16:28.248
LIAM: Oh, he worked so hard on that!

02:16:28.248 --> 02:16:30.790
SAM: You know, let's just attack just 'cause.

02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:34.274
LIAM: And now the Ettin just wants to crochet
things with us.

02:16:34.274 --> 02:16:37.973
MATT: So you guys would be right about there.

02:16:37.973 --> 02:16:41.623
LAURA: Look at our beautiful horses. How come
one-- Mamma Mia is way prettier than Dancing Queen.

02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:43.156
SAM: Yeah.

02:16:43.156 --> 02:16:50.681
MATT: All right, so, general positioning: Caduceus
would be in the front, with Jester there.

02:16:50.681 --> 02:16:52.210
LAURA: Oh, okay. I was inside, but I'll take it.

02:16:52.210 --> 02:16:53.526
TALIESIN: I'm so tall. All right.

02:16:53.526 --> 02:16:54.708
MATT: Or no, was Beau here in the front?

02:16:54.708 --> 02:16:56.317
LAURA: All of us were in the back except for
Taliesin.

02:16:56.317 --> 02:16:58.205
TALIESIN: I think it was just me at this point.

02:16:58.205 --> 02:17:04.664
MATT: There you go. That'll work, there. We'll say
you're in the cart there. Haphazardly.

02:17:05.774 --> 02:17:08.672
TALIESIN: Yeah, because you guys can see this
whole thing.

02:17:08.843 --> 02:17:11.188
LAURA: Look at your little mini. Your mini's so
pretty.

02:17:11.188 --> 02:17:12.694
TALIESIN: Isn't he? Isn't he pretty?

02:17:12.694 --> 02:17:14.141
TRAVIS: Yeah, we haven't seen Cadeceus yet.

02:17:14.141 --> 02:17:15.004
SAM and LAURA: Whoa!

02:17:15.004 --> 02:17:16.314
LAURA: Those things are huge!

02:17:16.314 --> 02:17:17.943
MARISHA: Oh my god. Oh goodness!

02:17:17.943 --> 02:17:19.509
MATT: And so this is the one that came around this
end.

02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:20.677
SAM: They really have two heads?

02:17:20.677 --> 02:17:22.447
MATT: They literally have two heads.

02:17:22.447 --> 02:17:24.318
TRAVIS: That's fucking awesome.

02:17:24.318 --> 02:17:29.320
LIAM: That miniature is like the Garbage Pail Kid
card that you get 97 of. It is the most frequent

02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:30.724
find in the box.

02:17:30.724 --> 02:17:31.653
MARISHA: Ettins?

02:17:31.653 --> 02:17:33.940
LIAM: Ettins. Got a lot of Ettins.

02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:39.283
MATT: So this one, currently under the Calm
Emotions, which you're concentrating on. The other

02:17:39.283 --> 02:17:45.970
one is yelling at it (monster yelling), pointing
at you, and the other guy is like (confused

02:17:45.970 --> 02:17:47.547
monster yelling).

02:17:47.547 --> 02:17:51.373
TALIESIN: I can understand this, too, and I'm
going to chime in a bit. I think it's really

02:17:51.373 --> 02:17:56.316
unfair you're just putting this all on him. I
think you really-- you've got to chill out a bit.

02:17:56.316 --> 02:18:01.542
I mean, you seem like a nice guy. You're really
listening to this? God. I'm also, still very

02:18:01.542 --> 02:18:03.398
gently, still moving forward.

02:18:03.398 --> 02:18:04.402
MATT: Okay.

02:18:04.402 --> 02:18:06.020
TALIESIN: You guys have got issues, man.

02:18:06.020 --> 02:18:13.336
MATT: Pushing slowly forward. Trotting along that
way. This guy comes out and begins arguing loudly

02:18:13.336 --> 02:18:17.919
with the other as he comes forward, too, shouting
at him, and they're both yelling over both of you now.

02:18:18.076 --> 02:18:20.493
MARISHA: Oh my god. Just keep this going.

02:18:20.493 --> 02:18:22.484
TALIESIN: Language! Come on!

02:18:22.484 --> 02:18:30.717
MATT: "You shut up! You no hun-- you speak...
same?"

02:18:30.717 --> 02:18:35.153
TALIESIN: Yeah, man. Who doesn't speak Giant?
That's just rude.

02:18:35.153 --> 02:18:41.907
MATT: And the one who you didn't cast it on is
like, "You so dumb! You two not listen! Ruin this!"

02:18:42.115 --> 02:18:45.746
TALIESIN: I don't think you're dumb. And I'm just
still going. (giggles)

02:18:45.746 --> 02:18:47.077
MATT: You push ahead a little bit further.

02:18:47.077 --> 02:18:48.421
SAM: Oh, god.

02:18:49.127 --> 02:18:55.049
LIAM: In the meantime, I pull out a white feather,
and I trace a triangle in the air, and I cast Fear

02:18:55.049 --> 02:18:56.799
on this one.

02:18:56.799 --> 02:18:58.820
TALIESIN: Bless you.

02:18:59.087 --> 02:19:00.724
MATT: And what's the saving throw on that one?

02:19:00.724 --> 02:19:02.505
LIAM: 16.

02:19:03.692 --> 02:19:06.528
MATT: That is a natural 13. And what's the wisdom
save?

02:19:06.528 --> 02:19:07.813
LIAM: 13 is the DC.

02:19:07.813 --> 02:19:12.752
MATT: It's a Wisdom save, you said? Yeah, that's a
failure. So that one--

02:19:12.752 --> 02:19:16.293
TRAVIS: What. The fuck.

02:19:16.564 --> 02:19:17.673
TALIESIN: Wizards, man!

02:19:17.673 --> 02:19:23.114
MATT: --goes from arguing and goes like, "Well,
fine! You won't finish this, we do it ourselves."

02:19:23.114 --> 02:19:26.783
And they reach over and grab this large boulder
and begin to pick it up, and at that point, Caleb

02:19:26.783 --> 02:19:31.570
finishes his incantation, and they go (boulder
crashing noise), drop it, (monster screaming) and

02:19:31.570 --> 02:19:35.016
just start running the opposite direction as the
cart begins to slowly roll forward.

02:19:35.016 --> 02:19:36.181
LAURA: This is great!

02:19:36.181 --> 02:19:37.425
MATT: Begins charging off this way.

02:19:37.425 --> 02:19:38.793
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:19:38.793 --> 02:19:40.769
TALIESIN: Stay all right, my friend. You stay all
right.

02:19:40.769 --> 02:19:42.312
LIAM: I tap Nott on the shoulder--

02:19:42.312 --> 02:19:44.326
TALIESIN: Don't let anybody tell you what you
can't do.

02:19:44.326 --> 02:19:46.602
LIAM: Those two just saw their worst fears.

02:19:46.602 --> 02:19:48.533
SAM: Wow! That was incredible.

02:19:48.533 --> 02:19:52.773
MATT: This guy just turns around and begins to
like-- waves back to you and heads around that direction.

02:19:52.966 --> 02:19:56.468
TALIESIN: It's not a concentration, by the way.

02:19:56.468 --> 02:19:57.734
MATT: Calm Emotions is.

02:19:57.734 --> 02:20:03.252
TALIESIN: Calm Emotions for me is not. Doesn't--
is not a concentration. No. Yes, it is! You're

02:20:03.252 --> 02:20:05.492
right, never mind. I don't know how to read spells
yet.

02:20:05.492 --> 02:20:07.429
MATT: That's okay. It also only lasts a minute.

02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:09.556
TALIESIN: Yeah. So, you know, we've been rolling.

02:20:09.556 --> 02:20:12.544
MATT: So these guys both run off the side there--

02:20:12.544 --> 02:20:15.139
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going. And now I'm booking.

02:20:16.729 --> 02:20:19.102
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Wow.

02:20:19.301 --> 02:20:20.815
TALIESIN: Boom, motherfuckers!

02:20:20.815 --> 02:20:23.264
MARISHA: Awesome. Fucking awesome.

02:20:23.264 --> 02:20:26.553
MATT: So, as you guys continue running--

02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:28.066
LIAM: It's so beautiful.

02:20:28.066 --> 02:20:29.756
MARISHA: We used it. Kind of.

02:20:29.756 --> 02:20:32.756
LIAM: Wait, now he can spin it around and it's a
different part of the canyon entirely.

02:20:32.756 --> 02:20:34.156
LAURA: Cool.

02:20:34.156 --> 02:20:36.337
TALIESIN: And you have to turn the little marquee
again.

02:20:36.337 --> 02:20:37.932
LIAM: 100 feet later.

02:20:37.932 --> 02:20:39.674
LAURA: He already did it. He already did it.

02:20:39.674 --> 02:20:41.308
SAM: And now we're in a totally different place.

02:20:41.308 --> 02:20:43.982
LIAM: This is like old animation where it just
repeats and repeats and repeats.

02:20:43.982 --> 02:20:47.787
MATT: Kind of, yeah. So, as you guys continue
pressing forward on this path--

02:20:47.787 --> 02:20:49.269
SAM and LAURA: Oh no!

02:20:49.269 --> 02:20:50.726
MATT: The rocks destroy you!

02:20:50.726 --> 02:20:51.934
MARISHA: There's a rock slide, you guys.

02:20:51.934 --> 02:20:53.875
LIAM: The Ettins are throwing boulders at us. Go,
go, go!

02:20:53.875 --> 02:20:56.272
SAM: Caduceus, that was amazing!

02:20:56.272 --> 02:20:57.925
TALIESIN: We'd better run.

02:20:57.925 --> 02:21:00.948
SAM: And Caleb, even better.

02:21:00.948 --> 02:21:05.066
MATT: So the horses, moving forward, at a--

02:21:05.350 --> 02:21:09.350
TALIESIN: I tell the horses, we're going fast.

02:21:09.350 --> 02:21:14.060
MATT: All right, so make an animal handling check,
because you're now going into a straight-- just go for it.

02:21:14.174 --> 02:21:15.078
TALIESIN: Animal handling?

02:21:15.078 --> 02:21:16.236
MATT: Yep.

02:21:17.066 --> 02:21:18.251
TALIESIN: 21.

02:21:18.457 --> 02:21:19.721
SAM: Jesus.

02:21:19.721 --> 02:21:25.605
MATT: Without issue, you, horse speaker Caduceus
Clay, give them the intent to go into a gallop and

02:21:25.605 --> 02:21:31.199
they begin picking up loudly, and you hear the
kind of soft neighing as they begin galloping

02:21:31.199 --> 02:21:38.061
forward, the cart taking up speed. At which point,
you hear a voice behind go, "Hey, wait a minute!"

02:21:38.061 --> 02:21:39.833
TALIESIN: The jig is up!

02:21:39.833 --> 02:21:43.159
MATT: And you see as the one with Calm Emotions
begins charging forward. Is it a saving throw on

02:21:43.159 --> 02:21:45.421
Fear every turn?

02:21:45.421 --> 02:21:51.328
LIAM: I assume it is, yeah. Yeah. Where did it go?
Where did it go? This is my first time casting it.

02:21:52.646 --> 02:21:54.129
MARISHA: One minute.

02:21:55.311 --> 02:21:59.615
LIAM: If the creature ends its (mumbling)-- must
take the dash action. If a creature--

02:22:01.251 --> 02:22:03.771
SAM: (singing with the music)

02:22:03.771 --> 02:22:06.952
LIAM: For the duration. It just says it becomes
frightened for the duration.

02:22:06.952 --> 02:22:08.676
LAURA: How long is the duration?

02:22:08.676 --> 02:22:10.145
LIAM: One minute.

02:22:10.145 --> 02:22:11.763
SAM: Doesn't say there's any saves?

02:22:11.763 --> 02:22:12.703
MATT: It's concentration--

02:22:12.703 --> 02:22:14.413
LIAM: I'm looking. Where is it? Do you see it?

02:22:14.413 --> 02:22:17.183
MARISHA: No, if a creature ends its turn in a
location where it doesn't have a direct line of

02:22:17.183 --> 02:22:18.371
sight on you--

02:22:18.371 --> 02:22:20.626
LIAM: Oh, if it doesn't have line of sight on me,
it makes a wisdom save.

02:22:20.626 --> 02:22:25.714
MATT: Right. So it fails the first one. Succeeds
on the second one. So it'll be three rounds in, it

02:22:25.714 --> 02:22:29.594
gains it back, which is just about the time it
would take for the Calm Emotions to fade at this

02:22:29.594 --> 02:22:36.089
point. So, at this point, as you guys are running
forward, at a double-speed here, moving forward.

02:22:36.089 --> 02:22:40.623
Horse speed-- pulling the cart, though, it's only
going to be about half of that actual horse speed here.

02:22:40.808 --> 02:22:46.613
MARISHA: I'll go ahead and hop out and try and
give the horses less weight to pull, and run alongside.

02:22:46.613 --> 02:22:51.915
MATT: Okay. So Beau's now charging alongside
there. The rest of you are pushing forward, kind

02:22:51.915 --> 02:22:57.316
of going in that realm, at which point this Ettin
comes charging around the corner there, no longer

02:22:57.316 --> 02:23:01.457
affected by the Calm Emotions, and you can see the
other one is rushing up behind, going, "You

02:23:01.457 --> 02:23:08.749
stupid! We're supposed to work together!" And the
one to the left goes like, "I told you we

02:23:08.749 --> 02:23:14.288
shouldn't work with more than one!" And he's right
off to the side here, beginning to give, so I need

02:23:14.288 --> 02:23:15.765
everyone to roll initiative now.

02:23:15.765 --> 02:23:18.090
(groaning)

02:23:22.107 --> 02:23:23.496
TALIESIN: There we go.

02:23:23.496 --> 02:23:34.685
MATT: Oh, wow. And (sharp inhale) they're rolling
good initiative on their end. All righty, so, 25 to 20?

02:23:34.838 --> 02:23:36.242
SAM: 24.

02:23:36.242 --> 02:23:37.646
MARISHA: 23.

02:23:37.646 --> 02:23:39.465
LIAM: Noice, noice, noice.

02:23:39.465 --> 02:23:40.908
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:23:40.908 --> 02:23:42.364
TALIESIN &amp;amp; LIAM: 16.

02:23:46.424 --> 02:23:49.124
MATT: All righty. And then we have--

02:23:53.749 --> 02:23:55.507
MARISHA: Caduceus, then Caleb?

02:23:55.507 --> 02:23:57.229
TRAVIS: Yep. Or either way.

02:23:57.229 --> 02:23:58.765
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

02:23:58.765 --> 02:24:00.085
TRAVIS: Ten.

02:24:00.085 --> 02:24:02.499
MATT: Oh no!

02:24:02.766 --> 02:24:04.718
LIAM: (Jester voice) Jester, where did you land?

02:24:04.718 --> 02:24:06.118
LAURA: I landed on six.

02:24:06.118 --> 02:24:07.428
LIAM: Aww.

02:24:07.428 --> 02:24:09.323
LAURA: It is a sad day.

02:24:09.323 --> 02:24:14.548
MATT: Sorry, Jester. All right, so, Nott, you're
up first. They're now like (heavy footfalls) running.

02:24:14.687 --> 02:24:16.606
SAM: How far is the closest one?

02:24:16.606 --> 02:24:19.646
MATT: They have a battleaxe in one hand that's
half made out of stone, with a giant piece of

02:24:19.646 --> 02:24:23.743
splintered tree wood that's been wrapped around it
with rope. In the other hand, they have this giant

02:24:23.743 --> 02:24:27.546
club from another piece of what looked like a
dried and dead tree that still has bits of root

02:24:27.546 --> 02:24:31.666
and chunks of rock jammed in the side of it, and
they both (heavy footfalls), charging towards you.

02:24:31.666 --> 02:24:35.226
One head's looking at you and the other's just
looking up at the air at a bird that flies

02:24:35.226 --> 02:24:38.048
overhead. It looks a little spooked (scared
grunt). So what are you doing?

02:24:38.048 --> 02:24:40.012
SAM: How far is the closest one?

02:24:40.012 --> 02:24:42.086
MATT: The closest one to you, because you're
technically in the back of the cart right here--

02:24:42.272 --> 02:24:44.031
LAURA: Technically, you're in the back of the
cart.

02:24:44.031 --> 02:24:48.214
MATT: Yeah, he'd be about 35 feet from you.

02:24:48.748 --> 02:24:53.973
SAM: (snarls) These fucking things.

02:24:53.973 --> 02:24:55.420
TALIESIN: You can hold.

02:24:55.420 --> 02:25:00.028
SAM: I know. Because I'm hidden from their view,
right? As far as I know?

02:25:00.028 --> 02:25:03.658
MATT: As far as you know, yeah. They don't know
you're in the cart.

02:25:04.399 --> 02:25:05.953
SAM: Hmm.

02:25:06.813 --> 02:25:08.478
MATT: Fjord's in there as well.

02:25:08.478 --> 02:25:14.833
SAM: Yeah, I guess I'll hold. I mean, otherwise I
have to shoot at it at disadvantage. Eh! I'll take

02:25:14.833 --> 02:25:17.422
a shot at disadvantage. I'm hidden, though.

02:25:17.422 --> 02:25:20.458
MATT: You are, so it doesn't know you're there, so
you have advantage, so it's just a single roll.

02:25:20.458 --> 02:25:25.293
SAM: D'oh! That's a ten.

02:25:25.293 --> 02:25:30.275
MATT: Ten misses. It goes wide, out of the side,
and the head that was watching the bird goes

02:25:30.275 --> 02:25:36.755
(growling) and peers closer to the cart with an
untrusting eye, its chin tilted to the side. This

02:25:36.755 --> 02:25:43.619
is a terrible look now. You see these very bulbous
faces that are a combination of muscle and fat

02:25:43.619 --> 02:25:48.900
pushing into the eye sockets. They have these
tiny, beady giant eyes. You see these round-ish,

02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:54.375
pushed-in pug noses and this large gaping jaw,
ogre-like with two big tusks that protrude from

02:25:54.375 --> 02:26:01.352
underneath. Long, scraggly dark beards that pour
down the sides of their face and over the front of

02:26:01.352 --> 02:26:09.331
their chest, mingling with matted bits of chest
hair over this tanned and sun-weathered flesh,

02:26:09.331 --> 02:26:17.684
uncovered, made of sheer muscle and anger. You can
see each head has its own series of scars and

02:26:17.684 --> 02:26:21.632
weird personality and as they're running, they're
still arguing with each other as they're in the

02:26:21.632 --> 02:26:27.771
process of getting to you. "We need to go from the
side!" "No! Direct attack!" On this end, the other

02:26:27.771 --> 02:26:34.849
one goes like: "Budak, don't be stupid!" The other
head's like: "But Budak's our friend." "Shut up!"

02:26:35.450 --> 02:26:37.455
That the end of your turn, Nott?

02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:42.064
SAM: I can bonus action fire again, or I can get
off this cart of death that they're going to be

02:26:42.064 --> 02:26:51.209
swinging at pretty soon. I'll just shoot again. Oh
boy. 17.

02:26:51.209 --> 02:26:52.702
LAURA: That's good.

02:26:52.702 --> 02:26:53.878
MATT: 17?

02:26:53.878 --> 02:26:55.561
LAURA: They're big.

02:26:55.561 --> 02:26:57.842
MATT: That hits the guy over here, yes.

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.353
SAM: Sneak attack or no?

02:26:59.353 --> 02:27:00.745
MATT: Yeah, he still hasn't quite seen you.

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:02.215
SAM: Oh, that's great!

02:27:02.215 --> 02:27:04.405
MATT: It shot out there, but he's not quite sure
what's going on. They're not very intelligent

02:27:04.405 --> 02:27:06.803
creatures, you get the idea.

02:27:06.803 --> 02:27:09.308
LAURA: Ooh. Not bad.

02:27:09.308 --> 02:27:17.400
SAM: I'll use Fury of the Small. So that's 25.

02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:23.567
MATT: 25 points of damage. Nice. As they're
running, the bolt lets loose and goes right into

02:27:23.567 --> 02:27:28.413
the lower jaw of the one on the left, the one that
was being referred to as Bodak.

02:27:28.413 --> 02:27:29.404
SAM: Bodak.

02:27:29.404 --> 02:27:30.313
MATT: Budak.

02:27:30.313 --> 02:27:31.276
SAM: Budak.

02:27:31.276 --> 02:27:35.051
MATT: As it hits, goes (gargling) and starts
reaching up with the hand that's holding the club

02:27:35.051 --> 02:27:42.096
to try and pull the bolt out while the other head
goes: "Come on! Put your weight into it!" And just

02:27:42.096 --> 02:27:44.451
keeps charging forward. That end your turn, Nott?

02:27:44.451 --> 02:27:45.388
SAM: Yep.

02:27:45.388 --> 02:27:46.938
MATT: All right. Beau, you're up.

02:27:46.938 --> 02:27:49.366
MARISHA: Are the horses still going to move on
Caduceus' turn?

02:27:49.366 --> 02:27:51.870
MATT: The horses move at initiative count 20.

02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:52.721
MARISHA: Oh.

02:27:52.721 --> 02:27:54.232
MATT: Just for ease of maintaining it.

02:27:54.232 --> 02:27:56.278
MARISHA: Okay.

02:27:56.278 --> 02:28:00.526
MATT: Which is right after Caleb and Caduceus I
believe, right? What did you roll for initiative?

02:28:00.526 --> 02:28:02.637
TALIESIN: 17?

02:28:02.637 --> 02:28:04.655
MATT: 17. So it's right above you. It's before you
guys.

02:28:04.655 --> 02:28:06.084
TALIESIN: Or 16. Was it 16?

02:28:06.084 --> 02:28:08.284
LAURA: You guys rolled 16, yeah.

02:28:08.284 --> 02:28:12.653
MATT: So it's before Caleb, sorry. So after your
turn the horses will move, Beau.

02:28:12.653 --> 02:28:15.856
MARISHA: Fuck. What do I do?

02:28:15.856 --> 02:28:17.456
MATT: What do you do?

02:28:17.661 --> 02:28:21.972
MARISHA: Well, I can get to one of
them for sure. I can get to that one, but can I

02:28:21.972 --> 02:28:24.079
get to that one over there?

02:28:24.079 --> 02:28:25.159
MATT: Possibly.

02:28:25.159 --> 02:28:26.224
MARISHA: 45 feet.

02:28:26.224 --> 02:28:26.992
MATT: Your movement's 45 feet?

02:28:26.992 --> 02:28:28.064
MARISHA: 45.

02:28:28.064 --> 02:28:29.657
MATT: Yeah, you can definitely get to this guy.

02:28:29.657 --> 02:28:31.569
SAM: And you're on your own.

02:28:31.569 --> 02:28:33.450
TALIESIN: You're on your own. And we're moving at
speed.

02:28:33.450 --> 02:28:34.791
MARISHA: Okay, so we are moving.

02:28:34.791 --> 02:28:37.880
MATT: The cart's moving regardless. What are you
doing?

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:44.593
MARISHA: I'm going to go right in the middle in
between them, behind the cart.

02:28:44.593 --> 02:28:45.878
MATT: Right here?

02:28:45.878 --> 02:28:49.940
MARISHA: No, back. Yeah. Back a little more,
towards you.

02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:50.978
MATT: Oh. There?

02:28:50.978 --> 02:28:54.436
MARISHA: Yeah. Then I'm going to take the dodge
action.

02:28:54.436 --> 02:28:56.380
MATT: Patient Defense or dodge action.

02:28:56.380 --> 02:29:00.198
MARISHA: I'm going to take the dodge action. Can I
hold my attack if I take the dodge action?

02:29:00.198 --> 02:29:04.113
MATT: No. It's holding your action, holding would
be doing that and bonus action--

02:29:04.113 --> 02:29:05.590
MARISHA: Patient Defense? Can I do that?

02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:06.361
MATT: You can do that.

02:29:06.361 --> 02:29:07.301
MARISHA: I do that.

02:29:07.301 --> 02:29:08.605
MATT: All right, bonus action, Patient Defense.

02:29:08.605 --> 02:29:13.351
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my action as soon as
one of them is close enough to hit.

02:29:13.351 --> 02:29:15.431
MATT: Okay, so you're readying an attack for when
one of them gets close enough to hit.

02:29:15.431 --> 02:29:16.236
MARISHA: Correct.

02:29:16.236 --> 02:29:18.882
MATT: You got it. All right, that ends Beau's
turn. The horses now move.

02:29:23.082 --> 02:29:24.534
LAURA: Oh no, Beau!

02:29:24.686 --> 02:29:25.786
MARISHA: It's okay.

02:29:25.786 --> 02:29:28.053
SAM: We'll be back in a few hours.

02:29:28.053 --> 02:29:30.268
MARISHA: You guys go. Keep going, keep going.

02:29:30.268 --> 02:29:31.780
TRAVIS: She's got Flintstone feet.

02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:33.990
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Caleb.

02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:35.724
LIAM: How far away-- oh boy!

02:29:35.918 --> 02:29:37.458
MATT: Yeah.

02:29:37.458 --> 02:29:39.685
TRAVIS: That change things.

02:29:39.685 --> 02:29:40.715
MATT: It does.

02:29:40.715 --> 02:29:44.042
LIAM: Caleb is going to jump out of the back of
the cart.

02:29:44.042 --> 02:29:46.317
SAM: Oh no. Caleb, no!

02:29:46.317 --> 02:29:50.429
TRAVIS: (singing) That's one way to die.

02:29:50.928 --> 02:29:53.955
MATT: Has its own narrative with the death of the
minis.

02:29:53.955 --> 02:29:57.380
LIAM: I'm going to move to here.

02:29:57.380 --> 02:29:59.089
MATT: All righty.

02:29:59.089 --> 02:30:06.676
LIAM: And as I'm moving forward, I'm pulling out a
pinch of iron powder. And I let go of it, and pull

02:30:06.676 --> 02:30:11.586
my fingers apart, and Beau again becomes
Swoleregard.

02:30:11.586 --> 02:30:13.724
MATT: Oh snap!

02:30:13.724 --> 02:30:17.314
LIAM: And I will use the rest of my movement, I
think it's five or ten feet more, then to back

02:30:17.314 --> 02:30:20.081
away towards the cart once I've done it.

02:30:20.081 --> 02:30:21.284
MATT: Where's the mini?

02:30:21.284 --> 02:30:22.753
MARISHA: Where's big Beau?

02:30:22.753 --> 02:30:24.261
LIAM: Don't let them down.

02:30:24.261 --> 02:30:28.627
MATT: I painted it, but I'm trying to remember,
with the move, where it got put.

02:30:28.748 --> 02:30:31.593
LIAM: That's why I did this, so I could see the
big mini, Matt.

02:30:31.593 --> 02:30:33.741
MATT: I know! I'm so angry.

02:30:33.741 --> 02:30:37.859
TALIESIN: Is this the same day as we disguised
ourselves, or have we had a sleep?

02:30:37.859 --> 02:30:40.329
LAURA: From when we got the bag of jewels?

02:30:40.329 --> 02:30:41.654
MATT: It's been a couple hours.

02:30:41.936 --> 02:30:45.525
LAURA: Oh, okay. Just
making sure that-- okay.

02:30:45.525 --> 02:30:47.694
MATT: Oh yeah, from the jewels? Yeah, it's been a
few days from that.

02:30:47.694 --> 02:30:49.261
LAURA: It's been days?

02:30:49.261 --> 02:30:52.002
TALIESIN: From the jewels? Okay, so yeah, you're
fine.

02:30:52.002 --> 02:30:57.208
MARISHA: If anyone in production wants to look for
big Beau minis?

02:30:57.208 --> 02:30:59.026
TRAVIS: Yeah, good luck.

02:30:59.026 --> 02:31:02.690
MATT: Fuck, this would be the time to unveil it,
but nevertheless, here we are with the chaos of

02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:08.309
the past few weeks of moving. Next time! There's
big Beau, taking up all that space. All right, and

02:31:08.419 --> 02:31:12.016
for the remainder of your movement, Caleb?

02:31:12.016 --> 02:31:14.317
LIAM: Backing up towards the cart, jogging
backwards.

02:31:14.317 --> 02:31:16.381
MATT: You can get up against the cart, but not
into it.

02:31:16.381 --> 02:31:18.498
LIAM: Yep, doing that backward jog.

02:31:18.498 --> 02:31:20.747
MATT: That ends your go. Caduceus.

02:31:20.747 --> 02:31:31.934
TALIESIN: I'm trying to figure out that thing that
I can do where I can make someone vulnerable to

02:31:31.934 --> 02:31:33.705
terrible things.

02:31:34.425 --> 02:31:36.498
MATT: Oh, that's your Channel Divinity.

02:31:36.629 --> 02:31:41.814
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm trying to find it. Ah, Path of
the Grave.

02:31:41.814 --> 02:31:44.062
MATT: Yes. What's the range on it?

02:31:44.062 --> 02:31:45.806
TALIESIN: I'm too far away. It's 30 feet.

02:31:45.806 --> 02:31:47.342
MATT: Yeah, you'd have to get closer.

02:31:47.342 --> 02:31:51.071
TALIESIN: All right, so I can't quite do that yet.
That's really frustrating. So I'm just going to do

02:31:51.071 --> 02:31:55.801
what I can do from this distance, which is Sacred
Flame, I suppose.

02:31:55.801 --> 02:31:57.738
MATT: Okay, against which one?

02:31:57.738 --> 02:32:00.264
TALIESIN: I always take the left.

02:32:00.264 --> 02:32:03.072
MATT: All right, left one over here, you mean?

02:32:03.072 --> 02:32:04.793
TALIESIN: No, on my left. That one, yeah.

02:32:04.793 --> 02:32:08.424
MATT: All right, that is a natural 19 wisdom
save.

02:32:08.424 --> 02:32:09.643
TALIESIN: Dex save.

02:32:09.643 --> 02:32:14.446
MATT: Dex save? Oh, that's a 18. Still makes it,
though. So no effect, unfortunately. It sees it

02:32:14.446 --> 02:32:20.213
coming and ducks out of the way, and the burst of
divine energy explodes in the middle of the air,

02:32:20.213 --> 02:32:22.668
to no effect. That's your action.

02:32:22.668 --> 02:32:27.366
TALIESIN: That's my action. Yeah, that's all I
got.

02:32:27.366 --> 02:32:38.102
MATT: Okay. It's now their turn. The two ettins
rolled a 15 and a 14 initiative. This one here is

02:32:38.102 --> 02:32:42.619
going to go ahead and just run past. It's going to
go over on this end, that's (counting).

02:32:42.619 --> 02:32:44.133
LIAM: For fuck's sake!

02:32:44.133 --> 02:32:45.495
MARISHA: God damn it.

02:32:45.495 --> 02:32:52.171
MATT: 40 and then dash. (counting)

02:32:52.171 --> 02:32:57.017
MARISHA: You're amazing! I knew that production
would find it! Max is the best.

02:32:57.017 --> 02:33:00.365
(cheering)

02:33:00.365 --> 02:33:01.741
MATT: So much better.

02:33:01.741 --> 02:33:03.341
TRAVIS: Optimus Prime.

02:33:03.341 --> 02:33:07.883
MATT: I love it. Now that's Swoleregard right
there! I worked so hard to paint it, and then it

02:33:07.883 --> 02:33:11.773
never came up, and the moment it did, I was so
sad. Thank you, Max!

02:33:11.773 --> 02:33:13.876
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Mighty Nein, roll out!

02:33:13.876 --> 02:33:21.003
MATT: This guy is going to go ahead and just go
back and forth on this. That one over there makes

02:33:21.003 --> 02:33:26.416
no action, but it's coming right up to the cart
and it has both of its weapons out. All right.

02:33:26.416 --> 02:33:28.177
MARISHA: I can attack as soon as he comes up to
me?

02:33:28.177 --> 02:33:30.019
MATT: Yes you can. You get two attacks.

02:33:30.019 --> 02:33:33.203
MARISHA: Well, that's balls. Ten.

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:35.936
MATT: Ten does not hit. Ducks out of the way.

02:33:35.936 --> 02:33:38.098
LIAM: Thanks, Gil. Fuck you, Gil!

02:33:38.098 --> 02:33:40.451
MATT: What was that?

02:33:40.451 --> 02:33:41.990
MARISHA: It was an 11.

02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:48.210
MATT: Okay, so now you do actually make impact,
and your fist hits the stomach, and it hits what

02:33:48.210 --> 02:33:53.368
feels like solid stone with a layer of blubber as
you watch it kind of ripple around the tummy. One

02:33:53.368 --> 02:33:59.594
head goes, (snarling) and the other goes
(chuckling), and they both focus on you.

02:33:59.594 --> 02:34:01.571
MARISHA: You need to work out.

02:34:01.571 --> 02:34:06.792
MATT: And then both heads go, "Hmm?", and look
momentarily insecure, before they go, "No, we

02:34:06.792 --> 02:34:10.595
don't!" and they're going to take two strikes at
you with disadvantage because of your Patient

02:34:10.595 --> 02:34:11.677
Defense.

02:34:12.237 --> 02:34:14.386
TRAVIS: They can't see us, right?

02:34:14.518 --> 02:34:17.044
SAM: But they can still hit.

02:34:17.044 --> 02:34:22.398
MATT: That is a 15 to hit, which does not hit your
AC. The other strike does not hit; that's a 14 to

02:34:22.398 --> 02:34:30.462
hit. So you just deflect them out of the way.
"Stop moving lady, bigger lady," is what you hear,

02:34:30.462 --> 02:34:37.328
while you hear, (gibberish). That ends their go.
Fjord, you're up.

02:34:37.328 --> 02:34:39.821
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Oh Jesus, okay.

02:34:39.821 --> 02:34:43.550
MATT: It's like right above you. You look up on
it-- it doesn't see you. It hasn't focused on

02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:44.664
anyone in the cart.

02:34:44.664 --> 02:34:46.086
TRAVIS: So we're all doing the (sharp inhale).

02:34:46.086 --> 02:34:48.656
MATT: Yeah. And it's looking right down at Caleb.
One head's looking at Caleb and the other one's

02:34:48.656 --> 02:34:52.638
looking at Caduceus, and both weapons are raising
up, one for each of them. What are you doing?

02:34:52.638 --> 02:35:04.037
TRAVIS: What do I do? I'm going to take two swings
with the Summer Dance falchion at that guy right

02:35:04.037 --> 02:35:06.474
next to us. That does not-- that's a 13?

02:35:06.474 --> 02:35:08.925
MATT: 13 hits. They're big. They don't have a lot
of armor.

02:35:08.925 --> 02:35:10.600
TRAVIS: That's great. And 16.

02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:12.027
MATT: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage.

02:35:12.027 --> 02:35:13.937
SAM: Yeah, Summer Dance!

02:35:13.937 --> 02:35:16.837
MARISHA: Yeah, Summer Dance!
Summer Dance now!

02:35:17.701 --> 02:35:19.950
TRAVIS: So that's nine points of damage on the
first.

02:35:19.950 --> 02:35:21.880
SAM: (singing) Everybody summer dance now!

02:35:22.074 --> 02:35:24.999
TRAVIS: And that's five points of damage on the
second, so 13 total.

02:35:24.999 --> 02:35:26.544
MATT: 13 total.

02:35:26.544 --> 02:35:31.726
TRAVIS: And with my bonus action, can I cast Hex
Blade's Curse at the guy standing right next to us?

02:35:31.869 --> 02:35:36.945
MATT: Yes, you may. So as you reach out (slashing
sound), the blade emerging out of the weird

02:35:36.945 --> 02:35:43.750
illusion, and you can see him look confused. Leans
forward, and the head peaks past the point of

02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:46.044
illusion to see all of you in the cart.

02:35:46.044 --> 02:35:49.678
(yelling)

02:35:49.678 --> 02:35:53.883
MATT: As its head, which is the size of your body,
leans forward and grins, the horrible stench of

02:35:53.883 --> 02:36:01.465
its terrible breath pour in, you instinctually let
loose the curse, and you watch as the shadows leap

02:36:01.662 --> 02:36:06.986
up into its face. And it backs up a bit, and the
shadows now have coalesced around the corners of

02:36:06.986 --> 02:36:13.470
its jaw and the inside of its muscular and flabby
torso. The curse has taken a hold.

02:36:13.736 --> 02:36:16.285
TRAVIS: Can I turn and say: save the cart,
scatter!

02:36:16.285 --> 02:36:17.755
(laughing)

02:36:17.755 --> 02:36:20.144
MATT: Sure, that ends your turn, Fjord. Jester,
you're up.

02:36:20.144 --> 02:36:27.372
LAURA: Ah, that's me! Okay. I'm going to cast
Spiritual Weapon as a bonus action.

02:36:27.372 --> 02:36:29.784
MATT: All righty. Where are you putting it?

02:36:29.784 --> 02:36:33.486
LAURA: Right above his head so I can smack him.

02:36:33.486 --> 02:36:35.585
MATT: There's another Critter-made gift here.

02:36:35.585 --> 02:36:39.195
LAURA: Yay! Look at that cutie. Look, it's going
to smack him on the butt.

02:36:39.195 --> 02:36:40.792
LIAM: What was it?

02:36:40.792 --> 02:36:44.557
MATT: It's another of the floating lollipop. Go
ahead and make an attack with it.

02:36:46.679 --> 02:36:47.595
LAURA: 24.

02:36:47.802 --> 02:36:50.306
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll your damage on
that.

02:36:53.679 --> 02:36:58.043
LAURA: That's just a one, so that's five.

02:36:58.275 --> 02:37:01.949
MATT: Five points of damage with the Spiritual
Weapon. (smacks) on the back of the shoulders, and

02:37:01.949 --> 02:37:04.667
you still have your action to do a cantrip.

02:37:04.667 --> 02:37:08.509
LAURA: I'm going to run forward and touch him and
cast Inflict Wounds.

02:37:08.509 --> 02:37:10.957
MATT: That's two spells in the same round.

02:37:10.957 --> 02:37:12.612
LAURA: Just kidding!

02:37:12.612 --> 02:37:14.020
MATT: You can do a cantrip.

02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:19.457
LAURA: I'm going to cantrip him. Damn it. I'm
going to cast Toll the Dead.

02:37:19.457 --> 02:37:22.345
MATT: Okay, that's a-- what save?

02:37:22.345 --> 02:37:26.626
LAURA: That's a-- let me click on it and find out.
Wisdom.

02:37:26.626 --> 02:37:29.987
MATT: Wisdom. That is a nine. He does not succeed,
so go ahead and roll damage on that.

02:37:29.987 --> 02:37:33.857
LAURA: Yeah, 2d12! That doesn't count because it
jumped out.

02:37:33.857 --> 02:37:35.381
TALIESIN: That's a shame, it was a good roll.

02:37:35.381 --> 02:37:39.429
LAURA: That's a shame, I know. Woo! Two nines, 18
points of damage!

02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:43.860
MATT: 18 points of damage! So after getting
slammed in the back of the head on the left side--

02:37:43.970 --> 02:37:45.930
LAURA: One bell for each head.

02:37:45.930 --> 02:37:52.063
MATT: They both (groan), and you watch as dark
brackish blood pour out of the ears of each head

02:37:52.063 --> 02:37:55.872
as they rear back from the impact. That end your
turn?

02:37:55.872 --> 02:38:00.619
LAURA: And then I jump out of the cart and run
towards the horses. On the opposite side.

02:38:00.619 --> 02:38:04.159
MATT: So Jester leaves the cart and then join the
horses there?

02:38:04.159 --> 02:38:08.058
LAURA: Yeah, I got to run past the horses, because
I know they're going to catch up with me.

02:38:08.058 --> 02:38:14.644
MATT: (counting) So you're now-- you might want to
be there. So you're not going to be trampled by

02:38:14.644 --> 02:38:18.109
them. I know. That ends your turn. Back up to the
top of the round. Nott, you're up.

02:38:18.109 --> 02:38:19.395
SAM: Me again!

02:38:19.395 --> 02:38:20.786
MATT: Beau, you're on deck.

02:38:20.786 --> 02:38:23.119
SAM: Oh, but I'm not hidden anymore?

02:38:23.119 --> 02:38:26.163
MATT: No, he just looked in and saw you. Even
though you're hidden in the illusion, it's aware

02:38:26.163 --> 02:38:28.070
of your presence and your basic location.

02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:29.609
LAURA: But Fjord's right next to him.

02:38:29.609 --> 02:38:31.089
SAM: Oh, that's true. Fjord's engaged.

02:38:31.089 --> 02:38:32.554
MATT: Fjord is engaged. Technically, so are you.

02:38:32.554 --> 02:38:36.448
SAM: Then I will-- sneak attack still? Yes, no,
maybe?

02:38:36.448 --> 02:38:37.881
MATT: If you manage to hit.

02:38:37.881 --> 02:38:38.920
SAM: Oh, yes.

02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:40.775
MATT: You don't suffer ranged in melee.

02:38:40.775 --> 02:38:46.028
SAM: Then I will shootsky. Yeah, so that's 20
something.

02:38:46.028 --> 02:38:47.700
MATT: Yeah, that hits. That hits.

02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:52.719
SAM: Okay. Wow, good roll. 21.

02:38:52.719 --> 02:38:58.208
MATT: 21 to hit or 21 damage?

02:38:58.208 --> 02:38:59.459
SAM: 21 damage.

02:38:59.459 --> 02:39:05.006
MATT: Yeah, that does it. All right, cool. As it's
pulled back, the impact of the bells, it's almost

02:39:05.006 --> 02:39:08.772
reaching up instinctually, though it's holding
weapons, it can't really plug its ears, so it kind

02:39:08.772 --> 02:39:13.508
of uninstinctually bashes into each head a little
with its own fist. And as it pulls back, you see

02:39:13.508 --> 02:39:18.219
that one little exposed bit of the throat on the
one on the right, and you release it and it

02:39:18.219 --> 02:39:26.175
(gasps), that horrible sucking sound as it's
jammed into its trachea. It's (gasping for air),

02:39:26.175 --> 02:39:32.387
and the other head's like, (gibberish) which you
hear as, "Stop complaining." So that's your action.

02:39:32.591 --> 02:39:41.620
SAM: Great. I will use Disengage and hop off the
cart and try to run up next to Jester. You're on

02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:43.429
your own, Fjord!

02:39:44.098 --> 02:39:45.035
TRAVIS: Fuck!

02:39:45.035 --> 02:39:46.652
SAM: You said scatter!

02:39:46.652 --> 02:39:48.146
TRAVIS: I did!

02:39:48.146 --> 02:39:50.696
MATT: That ends your turn?

02:39:50.696 --> 02:39:51.286
SAM: Yep.

02:39:51.286 --> 02:39:52.287
MATT: Beau, you're up.

02:39:52.287 --> 02:39:53.540
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take--

02:39:53.540 --> 02:39:54.924
MATT: Caleb, you're on deck.

02:39:54.924 --> 02:40:00.652
MARISHA: Grab my hands behind this guy's head, and
just give him a full knee-- right thigh/knee, head

02:40:00.652 --> 02:40:04.348
right into the knee.

02:40:04.348 --> 02:40:05.863
MATT: Go for it. Roll first attack.

02:40:05.863 --> 02:40:07.786
MARISHA: 17.

02:40:07.786 --> 02:40:08.729
MATT: 17 hits.

02:40:08.729 --> 02:40:10.747
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do Stunning Strike.

02:40:10.747 --> 02:40:11.769
MATT: All righty.

02:40:11.769 --> 02:40:15.929
MARISHA: Eight damage.

02:40:15.929 --> 02:40:18.641
MATT: Eight points of damage, and it's a
constitution saving throw?

02:40:18.641 --> 02:40:19.162
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:40:19.162 --> 02:40:29.093
MATT: That is an eight, he does not succeed. He is
stunned. You can grab one head and then with the

02:40:29.093 --> 02:40:33.327
other head grab the other, and pull them down,
like slapping two heads together in The Three

02:40:33.327 --> 02:40:39.825
Stooges thing, but into your knee. They both
(groaning) and one of them like drops the club on

02:40:39.825 --> 02:40:44.211
one side and its hand reaches up to try and grab
the face and it's just all sorts of

02:40:44.211 --> 02:40:47.178
discombobulated. So continue your round. You have
advantage on your attacks now.

02:40:47.178 --> 02:40:49.832
MARISHA: I am now going to--

02:40:49.832 --> 02:40:52.771
MATT: Don't forget to roll your extra d4 for
damage, because you're big.

02:40:52.771 --> 02:40:57.517
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. Thanks, Caleb. Extra
one point.

02:40:57.517 --> 02:40:59.442
MATT: Nine, better than eight. All right.

02:40:59.442 --> 02:41:01.054
TRAVIS: In most countries.

02:41:01.054 --> 02:41:10.202
MARISHA: I am now going to attempt to, with that
knee, give a full front kick and try and knock him prone.

02:41:10.290 --> 02:41:11.737
MATT: Okay.

02:41:11.737 --> 02:41:13.652
MARISH: That's an athletics check, right?

02:41:13.652 --> 02:41:16.079
MATT: Yes, so you're using an action to try and
shove?

02:41:16.079 --> 02:41:18.938
MARISHA: Yeah, because I have advantage on
athletics checks.

02:41:18.938 --> 02:41:20.910
TRAVIS: Oh shit, you fucking--

02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:24.177
MARISHA: Okay, 17 again.

02:41:24.177 --> 02:41:25.125
MATT: Natural two!

02:41:25.125 --> 02:41:29.213
MARISHA: No wait, sorry. 16, but that's okay.

02:41:29.213 --> 02:41:36.213
MATT: Natural two. Even then, he's stunned, so he
would have-- it doesn't say anything about

02:41:36.774 --> 02:41:43.436
athletics or trying to escape it. Yeah, it doesn't
matter. He's down. So you trip the legs out from

02:41:43.436 --> 02:41:48.964
under him with like a low sweep and a shove,
(crash) onto the ground, weapons clattering to the

02:41:48.964 --> 02:41:50.860
middle of the ravine to each side of it.

02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:57.698
MARISHA: I'm going to turn and I'm going to run,
full sprint, towards that guy. My 45 speed.

02:41:57.698 --> 02:42:04.465
MATT: (counting) 45, you get right there.

02:42:04.465 --> 02:42:09.617
MARISHA: Bonus action, Flurry of Blows.

02:42:09.617 --> 02:42:10.382
MATT: Go for it.

02:42:10.382 --> 02:42:13.568
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

02:42:13.568 --> 02:42:15.248
MATT: So glad we got to use big Beau.

02:42:15.248 --> 02:42:16.659
TRAVIS: She is, man!

02:42:16.659 --> 02:42:25.640
MARISHA: Big Beau, big Beau. Okay, first attack.
Natural 18.

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:26.703
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

02:42:26.703 --> 02:42:32.201
MARISHA: Second attack, I'm just going to do both
of them. Natural one. So I'll take that natural

02:42:32.201 --> 02:42:38.877
18, which is three plus another three, six plus
four, so nine damage.

02:42:38.877 --> 02:42:41.197
MATT and LAURA: Six plus four is ten.

02:42:41.197 --> 02:42:42.368
MARISHA: Ten damage.

02:42:42.368 --> 02:42:43.221
MATT: There you go.

02:42:43.221 --> 02:42:44.032
MARISHA: It's okay.

02:42:44.032 --> 02:42:45.479
TALIESIN: I know, we are so done.

02:42:45.479 --> 02:42:46.467
MARISHA: We're so baked.

02:42:46.467 --> 02:42:53.607
MATT: So as you rush up, the first one slams
against the jaw of the left head, like slow-mo jaw

02:42:53.607 --> 02:42:58.985
spinning. The other one, you go to strike the
other head and this one, the actual hand that's

02:42:58.985 --> 02:43:04.980
holding the battleaxe, drops the battleaxe to
catch your large fist in its hand, and lean over.

02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:08.480
So one head is pulled back, and another head peeks
around the other head goin--

02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:14.882
MARISHA: With a Flurry of Blows, can I also try
and make that a Stunning Strike? Can I double down?

02:43:15.676 --> 02:43:18.471
MATT: There's nothing that says you can't. You
would have to spend more ki points to try, though.

02:43:18.471 --> 02:43:20.957
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to try and stun them with
that first one.

02:43:20.957 --> 02:43:22.029
MATT: Okay.

02:43:22.029 --> 02:43:24.273
MARISHA: Can I do that, or is it too far beyond?

02:43:24.273 --> 02:43:26.763
MATT: You can, but you weren't aware of it. So we
can try.

02:43:26.763 --> 02:43:30.046
MARISHA: I'm okay, if it's too late.

02:43:30.046 --> 02:43:34.417
MATT: That is a 19. That's a natural 16 plus
three. It has a pretty good constitution modifier.

02:43:34.961 --> 02:43:39.651
So it does resist the Stunning Strike, but good
try. That ends Beau's go. Caleb, you're up and

02:43:39.651 --> 02:43:40.279
then Caduceus.

02:43:40.279 --> 02:43:45.712
LIAM: I don't know if this is going to hit me, but
I'm going to risk going this way away from it up

02:43:45.712 --> 02:43:46.807
onto the gray stone.

02:43:46.807 --> 02:43:47.788
MATT: This way over here?

02:43:47.788 --> 02:43:48.411
LIAM: Yeah.

02:43:48.411 --> 02:43:53.447
MATT: All right, it is not stunned, it does get a
reaction. So as you're pulling back, it swings

02:43:53.447 --> 02:44:00.696
high with its club as it's currently dropped the
battleaxe. That's going to be a natural 15 plus

02:44:00.696 --> 02:44:01.974
eight. That is a 23 to hit.

02:44:01.974 --> 02:44:03.776
LIAM: I'll take it.

02:44:03.776 --> 02:44:05.014
MATT: All right.

02:44:05.014 --> 02:44:06.564
SAM: Caleb, no!

02:44:06.564 --> 02:44:10.394
LAURA: Caduceus, you have to heal him!

02:44:10.394 --> 02:44:20.633
MATT: 19 points of piercing damage, as this club
swings over with its jagged rocks and bits of

02:44:20.633 --> 02:44:22.650
stone and root.

02:44:22.650 --> 02:44:23.717
MARISHA: What, you're going to throw it at him?

02:44:23.717 --> 02:44:24.935
MATT: No, he's swung back and--

02:44:24.935 --> 02:44:26.436
LIAM: Ten feet of reach, probably.

02:44:26.436 --> 02:44:28.001
MARISHA: I get my Sentinel attack, right?

02:44:28.001 --> 02:44:28.929
MATT: You do, yes.

02:44:28.929 --> 02:44:33.911
MARISHA: It hits. It's a natural 15.

02:44:33.911 --> 02:44:36.151
MATT: Yeah, monks with Sentinel. They're nasty.

02:44:36.151 --> 02:44:44.057
MARISHA: Two plus four, plus my extra four. That's
six plus three is nine.

02:44:44.057 --> 02:44:51.244
MATT: Nine points of damage, nice. With this one,
you crack again. The hit slams into Caleb's back,

02:44:51.244 --> 02:44:56.671
sending him flying and shoulder-rolling, sliding
onto the ground and barely getting back up,

02:44:56.671 --> 02:45:01.866
knocked a bit for a loop from the impact. You
don't notice that; as you see the swing hit Caleb,

02:45:01.866 --> 02:45:09.019
instinctually, you slam your elbow right into the
ribcage. You hear multiple cracks as you get a

02:45:09.019 --> 02:45:13.356
good solid six or seven inches into the torso with
your elbow as you shatter parts of the ribcage

02:45:13.356 --> 02:45:16.220
there. (groaning) This guy's looking pretty
rough.

02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:17.199
SAM: Oh boy.

02:45:17.199 --> 02:45:18.323
MARISHA: Fuck, okay.

02:45:18.323 --> 02:45:23.979
LIAM: But I'm not done, so, pushing myself up and
trying to focus on the one on the ground and

02:45:23.979 --> 02:45:31.939
seeing double, hand on the glove, tighten it, and
I'm going to release three rays from it and-- hit

02:45:31.939 --> 02:45:38.231
the mic first-- and then hit the ettin on the
ground. Is that at advantage because he's down?

02:45:38.231 --> 02:45:39.816
MATT: No, it's at disadvantage because he's
prone.

02:45:39.816 --> 02:45:46.875
LIAM: I'm going to do it anyway. First one is ten,
doesn't hit.

02:45:46.875 --> 02:45:47.892
MATT: Ten misses.

02:45:47.892 --> 02:45:51.615
LIAM: Second one is a 20.

02:45:51.615 --> 02:45:52.649
MATT: That hits.

02:45:52.649 --> 02:45:56.820
LIAM: Yeah. Third one is 19.

02:45:56.820 --> 02:46:00.302
MATT: Two hit. Go ahead and roll 4d6.

02:46:00.302 --> 02:46:09.932
LIAM: Ugh! I made six, six, one, one. So 14 points
of damage.

02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:13.559
MATT: 14 points of fire damage. As one of them
fires off to the side and hits a stone

02:46:13.559 --> 02:46:18.927
(crackling), sending bits of rock and dust off to
the side, the two other ones slam into the sides

02:46:18.927 --> 02:46:23.545
of the ettin who's currently trying to find its
way up, but it has no ability to move its muscles,

02:46:23.545 --> 02:46:28.593
its body still tense from the Stunning Strike,
which actually would have given him advantage on

02:46:28.593 --> 02:46:29.890
the attack because he's stunned.

02:46:29.890 --> 02:46:30.981
MARISHA: So it would have evened out.

02:46:30.981 --> 02:46:34.955
MATT: Yeah, I forgot that, so roll one more roll
for the first one.

02:46:34.955 --> 02:46:36.056
LIAM: It's a two.

02:46:36.056 --> 02:46:42.850
MATT: First one still misses. There you go. As the
flames burn and begin to ignite elements, or at

02:46:43.310 --> 02:46:47.284
least singe bits of the furs and leathers that
wrap around its midsection, it's still desperately

02:46:47.284 --> 02:46:50.509
trying to get back to its feet. That ends your go.
Caduceus, you're up.

02:46:50.509 --> 02:46:54.813
TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to tap my staff and say, "Time to get out,

02:46:54.813 --> 02:47:03.071
"children." I'm going to bring a little nest of
creatures right on the back of his business right there.

02:47:03.071 --> 02:47:05.411
LAURA: Like onto his wenis?

02:47:05.411 --> 02:47:08.523
TALIESIN: Well, they get everywhere. It's a
swarm.

02:47:08.523 --> 02:47:12.188
SAM: You were in jail when this happened last
time.

02:47:12.188 --> 02:47:17.424
MATT: Caduceus, from the back of the cart, riding
it, slams his staff into the top of the cart and

02:47:17.424 --> 02:47:23.323
beetles begin to swarm out of the staff-- they've
been living on the inside-- and then (fluttering,

02:47:23.323 --> 02:47:30.353
buzzing) scooting over and begin swarming and
biting and attacking the side of the ettin as it's

02:47:30.353 --> 02:47:34.419
currently being consumed by the shadow and
everything around it. Go ahead and roll an attack

02:47:34.419 --> 02:47:35.176
for the--

02:47:35.176 --> 02:47:38.088
TALIESIN: What is the attack for that, by the way?
I think I might have that here, hold on, where is it?

02:47:38.089 --> 02:47:40.007
MATT: Should be in the staff.

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:50.074
TALIESIN: It's been acting a little weird. It
doesn't give me the attack stuff for it, because

02:47:50.074 --> 02:47:51.551
it's not linked to it properly.

02:47:51.551 --> 02:47:54.045
LAURA: Oh, weird. Yeah, it's blanks.

02:47:54.045 --> 02:47:56.703
MATT: That's unfortunate. Here, I'll find it.

02:47:56.703 --> 02:47:57.823
TALIESIN: Thank you, sorry.

02:47:57.823 --> 02:48:02.726
MATT: Swarm of Beetles. Go ahead and roll a bite
attack. It's a d20 plus three.

02:48:02.726 --> 02:48:05.207
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:48:05.207 --> 02:48:09.851
MATT: Ten total? That misses. The beetles are
climbing up the side of its body, but they're

02:48:09.851 --> 02:48:14.444
unable to penetrate the thick, giantkin skin. It
doesn't seem to mind so much as they haven't been

02:48:14.444 --> 02:48:19.260
able to get into any sort of sensitive tissue, but
you can see this dark cluster, as the beetles are

02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:21.759
beginning to form up the right side of its body.

02:48:21.759 --> 02:48:22.958
SAM: It's the British Invasion.

02:48:22.958 --> 02:48:27.182
TALIESIN: I'm going to need a little bit more. I
turn to one of the beetles and, "Make him feel

02:48:27.182 --> 02:48:31.309
this," and have the beetle bite me and then swarms
and attacks him. I'm casting Bane.

02:48:31.309 --> 02:48:34.894
MATT: Oh! All righty.

02:48:34.894 --> 02:48:37.593
LAURA: The beetle bit you?

02:48:37.593 --> 02:48:40.255
TALIESIN: Yeah, because the beetle brings my
blood. I have to spill blood for this.

02:48:40.255 --> 02:48:41.971
LIAM: (Bane voice) Oh, sorry, giantkin.

02:48:41.971 --> 02:48:45.553
MATT: So the three creatures in range, 30 feet,
yeah, it's only going to hit the one guy.

02:48:45.553 --> 02:48:46.672
TALIESIN: It only can hit the one.

02:48:46.672 --> 02:48:51.432
MATT: Charisma saving throw. Natural 19 minus
one.

02:48:51.432 --> 02:48:52.225
TALIESIN: Fucker!

02:48:52.225 --> 02:48:54.805
MATT: I know! I'm sorry. It succeeds.

02:48:54.805 --> 02:48:57.741
LAURA: But hey, you saw a lot of things.

02:48:57.741 --> 02:49:03.546
MATT: You did. Oh, you avoided this, this ambush
could have been a lot more harrowing.

02:49:03.546 --> 02:49:04.524
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we're doing good.

02:49:04.524 --> 02:49:07.043
MATT: They were going to do some actual carnage.

02:49:07.043 --> 02:49:08.879
TALIESIN: That's okay, I'm just going to spend a
spell slot.

02:49:08.879 --> 02:49:10.252
MATT: That ends your turn, Caduceus?

02:49:10.252 --> 02:49:11.229
TALIESIN: That's what I got.

02:49:11.229 --> 02:49:15.064
MATT: Now it's their-- oh, actually, and the
horses are trying to push forward.

02:49:15.064 --> 02:49:18.969
SAM: Oh no! Jester got run over!

02:49:18.969 --> 02:49:20.390
LAURA: Oh no!

02:49:20.390 --> 02:49:23.069
LIAM: (singing) Jester got run over by a
reindeer.

02:49:23.069 --> 02:49:24.750
TALIESIN: The horses know who our friends are.

02:49:24.750 --> 02:49:32.129
MATT: All right. This guy is no longer stunned. Oh
no-- he's stunned until the end of your turn. I

02:49:32.129 --> 02:49:33.741
remember that. So he's still stunned; he can't do
anything.

02:49:33.741 --> 02:49:34.970
LAURA: I thought he was dead!

02:49:34.970 --> 02:49:39.416
MATT: No, he's just on the ground, stunned, prone,
and like (groans).

02:49:39.416 --> 02:49:42.033
SAM: He's much less damaged than the other guy.

02:49:42.033 --> 02:49:47.974
MATT: The other guy is going to go ahead and
move--

02:49:47.974 --> 02:49:52.901
TALIESIN: I don't suppose the other swarms get an
attack of opportunity?

02:49:52.901 --> 02:49:55.342
MATT: No, they do not. He's going to move
forward.

02:49:55.955 --> 02:49:57.944
MARISHA: So I'm going to buy an extra reaction,
for Sentinel.

02:49:57.944 --> 02:50:00.437
MATT: So you're going to use a ki point to buy an
extra reaction. Make an attack.

02:50:00.437 --> 02:50:01.933
MARISHA: Keep this motherfucker from going.

02:50:01.933 --> 02:50:03.531
MATT: That's one of the abilities of the class,
yeah.

02:50:03.531 --> 02:50:04.698
LIAM: That is amazing.

02:50:04.698 --> 02:50:07.189
MARISHA: 15. No, 16.

02:50:07.189 --> 02:50:08.698
MATT: 16 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:50:08.698 --> 02:50:11.157
TALIESIN: So he doesn't get to move, does he?

02:50:11.157 --> 02:50:12.393
MARISHA: No, he does not.

02:50:12.393 --> 02:50:16.270
MATT: He doesn't get to move past the melee range.
He gets caught there from the Sentinel feat.

02:50:16.270 --> 02:50:21.839
Sentinel and this class in particular is a really
good synergy. Do you want to make a monk tank?

02:50:21.839 --> 02:50:24.906
TALIESIN: From this position, you can clearly see
how this one would reach.

02:50:24.906 --> 02:50:26.257
(laughter)

02:50:26.257 --> 02:50:27.937
MARISHA: Nine damage, and he doesn't get to move.

02:50:27.937 --> 02:50:30.065
MATT: Nine damage. How do you want to do this?

02:50:30.065 --> 02:50:32.732
(cheering)

02:50:32.732 --> 02:50:33.664
LIAM: Yeah, he doesn't move!

02:50:33.664 --> 02:50:41.399
MARISHA: As he's trying to run away, and since I'm
big Beau, and I can do this, I just go: Oh, nope,

02:50:41.399 --> 02:50:43.437
no! And I stick my leg out, and trip him.

02:50:43.437 --> 02:50:49.482
MATT: Onto the ground, both faces (crashing) into
the stone and rock below you.

02:50:49.482 --> 02:50:50.743
MARISHA: Yeah, that's it.

02:50:50.743 --> 02:50:51.544
MATT: That's it?

02:50:51.544 --> 02:50:53.261
(laughter)

02:50:53.261 --> 02:50:54.473
MARISHA: I just want to Three Stooges trip him.

02:50:54.473 --> 02:50:58.821
MATT: He hits, and he stops moving, and you're
like, "Why is--? Like, how bad was it?" You kick

02:50:58.821 --> 02:51:04.330
the body over a little bit, with your large Beau
form, pull it back, and there is a cluster of

02:51:04.330 --> 02:51:11.249
sharpened stones in the ground that both faces
fell onto, and pierced into the skull. There's a

02:51:11.249 --> 02:51:12.810
trail of crimson coming out of the gap.

02:51:12.810 --> 02:51:15.480
MARISHA: That was real convenient, guys. Did you
see that?

02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:17.903
LIAM: (deep voice) That was real convenient,
guys.

02:51:17.903 --> 02:51:20.963
MARISHA: (deep voice) That was deeper than for
real.

02:51:20.963 --> 02:51:22.783
SAM: Let's get the fuck out of here!

02:51:22.783 --> 02:51:28.514
MATT: End of Beau's turn, that guy's no longer
stunned. All right. That brings us to Fjord.

02:51:28.514 --> 02:51:34.423
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just got done seeing the T-Rex
above my head, and big-ass Fjord knock it down and

02:51:34.423 --> 02:51:35.124
kill it.

02:51:35.124 --> 02:51:37.033
SAM: That wasn't Beau's turn, though.

02:51:37.033 --> 02:51:42.698
MATT: Well no, Beau's reaction. That was the
ettin's turn. One of them got unstunned, and the--

02:51:42.698 --> 02:51:46.479
I'm sorry, it wasn't Beau's turn, so it's still
stunned, actually. That's right.

02:51:46.479 --> 02:51:47.339
MARISHA: It's still stunned, yeah.

02:51:47.339 --> 02:51:52.987
TRAVIS: Happy to be out of death's doorway, I'm
going to send two Eldritch Blasts towards the guy

02:51:52.987 --> 02:51:53.740
on the ground.

02:51:53.740 --> 02:51:56.451
MATT: All right, go for it. That's just a straight
roll.

02:51:56.451 --> 02:51:59.725
TRAVIS: 22.

02:51:59.725 --> 02:52:00.662
MATT: 22 hits.

02:52:00.662 --> 02:52:04.078
TRAVIS: And 12.

02:52:04.078 --> 02:52:04.888
MATT: 12 just hits.

02:52:04.888 --> 02:52:14.389
TRAVIS: Just hits, great, okay. 1d10. That's seven
and nine. So 16 points.

02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:21.219
MATT: 16 points of damage. It's like (groans) and
the other face is like (speaks Giant), which you

02:52:21.219 --> 02:52:22.808
recognize as being, "Suck it up."

02:52:22.808 --> 02:52:23.986
(laughter)

02:52:23.986 --> 02:52:25.647
MATT: Does that end your turn, Fjord?

02:52:25.647 --> 02:52:26.388
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

02:52:26.388 --> 02:52:28.533
MATT: Fjord's staying inside. Jester, you're up.

02:52:28.613 --> 02:52:34.721
LAURA: Oh man, okay. I'm going to send my
Spiritual Weapon over. Does it get there? Probably not.

02:52:34.721 --> 02:52:35.578
MATT: That's as close as it gets.

02:52:35.578 --> 02:52:36.421
LAURA: That's fine.

02:52:36.421 --> 02:52:37.382
MATT: It hit one guy, though.

02:52:37.382 --> 02:52:40.484
LAURA: Am I within 120 feet of the guy that's
down?

02:52:40.484 --> 02:52:41.199
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:52:41.199 --> 02:52:46.738
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt
at... 3rd-level, fuck it.

02:52:46.738 --> 02:52:52.417
MATT: (laughs) All right. Go ahead and roll-- it's
a straight attack roll, thanks to him being

02:52:52.417 --> 02:52:55.175
stunned and prone, so they cancel out the
advantage and disadvantage.

02:52:55.175 --> 02:53:00.381
LAURA: Okay, Guiding Bolt. Hold on, I'm sorry, I
can't tell what's happening.

02:53:00.381 --> 02:53:01.150
MATT: That's okay.

02:53:01.150 --> 02:53:11.171
LAURA: Guiding Bolt. Okay. Okay, that does hit,
that's 19.

02:53:11.171 --> 02:53:12.535
MATT: All right, roll some damage.

02:53:12.535 --> 02:53:13.970
LAURA: 6d6!

02:53:13.970 --> 02:53:15.827
MARISHA: Kill him. Kill him!

02:53:15.827 --> 02:53:16.430
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:53:16.430 --> 02:53:19.752
TALIESIN: Whoa. I love it when a line-up like that
happens.

02:53:19.752 --> 02:53:21.101
LAURA: That was only five, huh?

02:53:21.101 --> 02:53:22.232
MATT: That was five, yeah.

02:53:22.232 --> 02:53:30.090
LAURA: Okay. Six plus ten is 16, 23, plus one
more... 24.

02:53:30.090 --> 02:53:36.695
MATT: 24 points of damage. Nice. Jester pulls
back, clutching the symbol of the Traveler around

02:53:36.695 --> 02:53:37.943
her neck--

02:53:37.943 --> 02:53:39.469
LAURA: It's on my waist.

02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:43.172
MATT: On your waist, sorry. You pull it up from
the waist, and (gentle, high-pitched explosion)

02:53:43.172 --> 02:53:48.862
release the Guiding Bolt. As it shoots out as a
singular beam, you watch as it swells with energy

02:53:48.862 --> 02:53:54.193
and intensity and slams into him. It actually
pushes him back five feet.

02:53:54.193 --> 02:53:56.757
(yelling)

02:53:56.757 --> 02:54:01.776
MATT: There you can see, from the impact, the
energy seems to expand and then contract to it,

02:54:01.776 --> 02:54:05.114
and you can now see the sparkles, as now Guiding
Bolt gives advantage to the next attack against it.

02:54:05.114 --> 02:54:06.060
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:07.803
MATT: And any movement?

02:54:07.803 --> 02:54:09.618
LAURA: I'm going to hop back on the cart.

02:54:09.618 --> 02:54:12.326
MATT: All right. Hop back up on the cart.

02:54:12.326 --> 02:54:13.567
LAURA: Hey Fjord, did you see that?

02:54:13.567 --> 02:54:14.796
TRAVIS: I saw it, Jester.

02:54:14.796 --> 02:54:15.804
LAURA: That was pretty cool, huh?

02:54:15.804 --> 02:54:18.172
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was pretty cool. Got a little
pee in my pants right now.

02:54:18.172 --> 02:54:19.595
MATT: Top of the round, Nott, you're up.

02:54:19.595 --> 02:54:21.611
SAM: Me? Oh gods.

02:54:23.501 --> 02:54:25.996
TALIESIN: I'm going to be stopping the carts.

02:54:25.996 --> 02:54:29.475
SAM: You're going to be stopping the cart? With
that thing?

02:54:29.475 --> 02:54:30.740
TALIESIN: This guy's going to be trashed.

02:54:30.740 --> 02:54:33.369
SAM: Oh no! All right, I'll--

02:54:37.259 --> 02:54:39.793
MATT: He's big enough to still be in the
battlefield.

02:54:39.793 --> 02:54:44.625
SAM: Okay, well then, I'm going to run up to the
dead body and hide behind it. Or in it.

02:54:44.625 --> 02:54:48.997
MATT: There's not a corpse to hide into, but
there's a wound that you can--

02:54:48.997 --> 02:54:52.654
SAM: Then I'll hold my action until the other one
starts moving towards us.

02:54:52.654 --> 02:54:56.204
MATT: Okay, gotcha. That ends Nott's turn. Beau,
you're up.

02:54:56.204 --> 02:55:00.225
SAM: And bonus action hide back there.

02:55:00.225 --> 02:55:01.093
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

02:55:01.093 --> 02:55:03.601
SAM: Okay, 21.

02:55:03.601 --> 02:55:09.095
MATT: Got it. Beau, your turn. Caleb, you're up
next with Caduceus on deck.

02:55:09.095 --> 02:55:10.727
MARISHA: You're holding your action until--

02:55:10.727 --> 02:55:13.838
SAM: It moves towards us, within 30 feet,
basically.

02:55:13.838 --> 02:55:21.256
MARISHA: Within 30 feet-- I'm probably more than
45 feet away. I'd have to run up and-- I'm just

02:55:21.256 --> 02:55:25.681
going to, from here, take out one of my throwing
darts and throw that.

02:55:25.681 --> 02:55:27.164
MATT: What's the range on that?

02:55:27.164 --> 02:55:30.210
MARISHA: 30 feet-- oh, I'm not within 30 feet, am
I?

02:55:30.210 --> 02:55:33.931
MATT: Yeah. Is that the minimum range? What's the
full range?

02:55:33.931 --> 02:55:37.691
MARISHA: I don't know. Darts--

02:55:37.691 --> 02:55:40.806
MATT: It's not a very long range on them.

02:55:40.806 --> 02:55:46.527
MARISHA: It's like 25 without-- it's fine. I'm
just going to--

02:55:47.548 --> 02:55:49.442
MATT: It's 20/60, so 60-foot long range.

02:55:49.442 --> 02:55:50.901
MARISHA: With disadvantage?

02:55:50.901 --> 02:55:56.384
MATT: With disadvantage. It's stunned, which is
advantage, and it's prone, so it's disadvantage.

02:55:56.384 --> 02:55:58.178
But Guiding Bolt, so it's advantage. So it's just
a regular roll.

02:55:58.178 --> 02:56:02.968
MARISHA: No, I'm going to wait for Nott for that
Guiding Bolt with advantage. I'm going to run

02:56:02.968 --> 02:56:03.676
towards the cart.

02:56:03.676 --> 02:56:06.371
MATT: Okay. (thuds)

02:56:06.371 --> 02:56:09.277
TRAVIS: Go away! Oh, hey Beau.

02:56:09.277 --> 02:56:11.562
MARISHA: (deep voice) It's just me, guys.

02:56:11.562 --> 02:56:12.958
SAM: Ah! It's another giant!

02:56:12.958 --> 02:56:16.279
TRAVIS: She's so much bigger than she used to be!

02:56:16.279 --> 02:56:17.210
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:20.883
LIAM: Ja, I'm going to back up five feet away,
and as I do so, I'm going to pull some bat shit

02:56:20.883 --> 02:56:26.186
out of one pocket and some sulfur in the other and
slap them together, and then stick my hands out

02:56:26.186 --> 02:56:28.015
and cast Fireball at it.

02:56:28.015 --> 02:56:31.607
MATT: Oh shit! It's the first Fireball of the
campaign!

02:56:31.607 --> 02:56:35.261
TRAVIS: Yeah! Bat shit and sulfur.

02:56:35.261 --> 02:56:39.408
MARISHA: Does that have advantage?

02:56:39.408 --> 02:56:42.596
LIAM: It's a different kind. It's a dex save, but
he's stunned, so I imagine he's not going to do

02:56:42.596 --> 02:56:43.750
too well. He's still prone.

02:56:43.750 --> 02:56:46.149
MATT: Oh, that was the end of Beau's turn, you're
right.

02:56:46.149 --> 02:56:47.835
MARISHA: Yeah, so he gets to shake it off.

02:56:47.835 --> 02:56:48.730
LIAM: But he's prone.

02:56:48.730 --> 02:56:53.055
TRAVIS: Oof. Drop the fucking--

02:56:53.055 --> 02:56:53.743
MARISHA: Kill him.

02:56:53.743 --> 02:56:57.939
MATT: Yeah, that consumes him. He has
disadvantage.

02:56:57.939 --> 02:56:58.957
LIAM: Dex save.

02:56:58.957 --> 02:57:10.372
MATT: No, prone doesn't give any changes to
dexterity. That's a natural five minus one for his

02:57:10.372 --> 02:57:11.125
dex save.

02:57:11.125 --> 02:57:12.734
LIAM: So, no. That is a no.

02:57:12.734 --> 02:57:14.714
MATT: So 8d6 fire damage to him.

02:57:14.714 --> 02:57:20.813
TRAVIS: (singing) I came in like a Fireball!

02:57:20.813 --> 02:57:23.471
LIAM: It's a total of 16 fire damage.

02:57:23.471 --> 02:57:26.379
MARISHA: Caleb, naked, riding the Fireball.

02:57:26.379 --> 02:57:36.795
MATT: Caleb sends out this tiny bead of red
energy, quietly streaks over, and then (explosion)

02:57:36.795 --> 02:57:42.511
detonates, this loud explosion that rocks the
center of the ravine. It echoes out through the

02:57:42.511 --> 02:57:47.953
mountainous area (explosion echoing). As the
flames die down, you can see the ettin on the

02:57:47.953 --> 02:57:54.352
ground (groaning). Its outside is now charred and
burnt. It looks very hurt.

02:57:54.352 --> 02:57:55.934
MARISHA: It's still alive?

02:57:55.934 --> 02:57:57.749
LIAM: Did I go five feet back from where I was?

02:57:57.749 --> 02:57:58.465
MATT: You did.

02:57:58.465 --> 02:58:00.273
LIAM: Okay, I feel very caffeinated right now.

02:58:00.273 --> 02:58:08.318
MATT: I believe you did. That ends Caleb's go.
Caduceus, you're up.

02:58:08.318 --> 02:58:13.449
TALIESIN: Am I within 60 feet of the guy on the
ground? The one that's far away.

02:58:13.449 --> 02:58:16.568
MATT: Him? No, you are not. You are more than that
away.

02:58:17.104 --> 02:58:18.940
TALIESIN: There's no way I can get within 60 feet
of him.

02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:20.192
LAURA: You could get within 60 feet.

02:58:20.192 --> 02:58:21.909
TALIESIN: I'm going to tell the horses to whoa.

02:58:21.909 --> 02:58:24.068
TRAVIS: How do you do that?

02:58:24.068 --> 02:58:29.765
MATT: No, he won't. Even at his full 30-foot
movement, he'll be just beyond the 60-foot range.

02:58:29.765 --> 02:58:31.352
TALIESIN: I'm going to tell the horses to whoa.

02:58:31.352 --> 02:58:33.902
MATT: Okay. They slow down.

02:58:33.902 --> 02:58:38.522
TALIESIN: I'm going to tell my beetles to keep
munching on that guy who's on the ground.

02:58:38.522 --> 02:58:44.264
MATT: They do. They begin to consume the eyes and
the ears, and whatever immediately soft, available

02:58:44.264 --> 02:58:46.928
flesh is there, the beetles begin to dine on it.

02:58:46.928 --> 02:58:48.191
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!

02:58:48.191 --> 02:58:49.710
SAM: I hope they're in his junk!

02:58:49.710 --> 02:59:02.893
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my-- I'm so sorry,
this is a new spell I'm learning. Stop, there we

02:59:02.893 --> 02:59:13.073
go. I'm going to hold Channel Divinity until the
one on the ground's within 30 feet of me. I'm

02:59:13.073 --> 02:59:19.080
going to whoa the horses and hold Channel Divinity
until there's a creature within 30 feet.

02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:23.781
MATT: That ends your turn. It is now the ettin's
turn. The ettin (grunts).

02:59:23.781 --> 02:59:26.532
TALIESIN: I'm also going to move to the front of
the cart too, so I'm right there next to everybody.

02:59:27.049 --> 02:59:28.907
MATT: Okay, so you've moved over to this position
there.

02:59:28.907 --> 02:59:29.380
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:59:29.380 --> 02:59:31.309
MATT: Where Jester is, at this little stone.

02:59:31.309 --> 02:59:33.324
TALIESIN: We're all-- Yeah.

02:59:33.324 --> 02:59:43.177
MATT: The ettin gets up, and sees the beetles
eating his ally. One head goes (laughing) the

02:59:43.177 --> 02:59:51.609
other goes (growling). Let's see. Nope! They go
(grunting), pick up one weapon, pick up the other,

02:59:51.609 --> 03:00:00.923
and just bolt away. Just book it out of here.
Self-preservation has kicked in.

03:00:00.923 --> 03:00:05.642
LIAM: If no one does anything else, I will send
another Fireball 150 feet.

03:00:05.642 --> 03:00:14.966
MATT: It just starts running away. That is an 11
minus one, does not make its next dexterity save.

03:00:14.966 --> 03:00:26.189
It's running up the mountains and like (grunting),
looking over its shoulder like, "Mmm. (laughing)!"

03:00:26.189 --> 03:00:27.153
LIAM: 25 points of fire damage.

03:00:27.153 --> 03:00:28.602
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:00:32.115 --> 03:00:37.501
LIAM: Because I have such an easy target at his
back, I give a little bit of a curveball to it,

03:00:37.501 --> 03:00:48.418
and I make the fireball beam of red go (whirring)
(explosion) and erupt about 15 feet back, and just

03:00:48.418 --> 03:00:49.456
burn the backside.

03:00:49.456 --> 03:00:56.017
MATT: You watch as It laughs and laughs, and in
the distance: (boom). And pieces go (whoosh).

03:00:56.017 --> 03:00:59.969
(laughter)

03:00:59.969 --> 03:01:07.325
MATT: Like one of those cartoons, like, (distant
explosion, fwoosh). Yeah, the wind blows past you

03:01:07.325 --> 03:01:09.792
guys. Make a wisdom saving throw.

03:01:09.792 --> 03:01:11.072
LIAM: Oh yeah, okay.

03:01:11.072 --> 03:01:14.349
LAURA: Those fireworks rivaled Hupperdook's.

03:01:14.349 --> 03:01:20.269
LIAM: Not great, but at least we're not under
attack. A ten.

03:01:20.269 --> 03:01:24.365
MATT: Ten. So as you're all like, "That was
incredible," you look back and Caleb's still

03:01:24.365 --> 03:01:25.759
standing there, hands extended.

03:01:25.759 --> 03:01:26.728
SAM: Oh, no.

03:01:26.728 --> 03:01:28.611
LAURA: Caleb!

03:01:28.611 --> 03:01:31.530
MARISHA: Beau goes over to Caleb--

03:01:31.530 --> 03:01:34.729
LIAM: You're still huge? Oh! Nope. Yeah, you're
huge.

03:01:34.729 --> 03:01:37.316
MARISHA: I pick Caleb up, and throw him over my
shoulder.

03:01:37.316 --> 03:01:40.709
LIAM: Is Enlarge still in place if I'm out of it?

03:01:40.709 --> 03:01:44.024
MATT: Yeah, you're still concentrating on the
spell. Unless you choose otherwise.

03:01:44.024 --> 03:01:48.488
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on Caleb
as he's walking by in this state.

03:01:48.488 --> 03:01:50.752
MARISHA: Nott, do you want to get on the other
shoulder?

03:01:50.752 --> 03:01:51.503
SAM: Yes.

03:01:51.503 --> 03:01:52.171
MARISHA: Okay.

03:01:52.171 --> 03:01:54.264
MATT: Actually, hold on. Does stun break
concentration? I imagine it would.

03:01:54.264 --> 03:01:55.542
LIAM: I would think.

03:01:55.542 --> 03:02:00.458
MATT: Yeah. So Beau, you go pick up Caleb. As you
do, your form shrinks down.

03:02:00.458 --> 03:02:04.003
MARISHA: Ugh! I'm fine!

03:02:04.003 --> 03:02:08.639
MATT: But he's a wispy fellow, you (whump) over
your shoulder; fireman's carry.

03:02:08.639 --> 03:02:10.233
MARISHA: I was just going to pick up Nott!

03:02:10.233 --> 03:02:13.173
TRAVIS: You can squat that.

03:02:13.173 --> 03:02:17.500
MATT: You could probably still curl Nott while
holding Caleb. You're pretty strong.

03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:19.340
SAM: Why are you shaking so much, Beau?

03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:23.139
MARISHA: (shakily) It's all good.

03:02:23.139 --> 03:02:30.018
TALIESIN: Also, I'm going to go over and cast
Decompose on that one that's-- See what pops out.

03:02:30.018 --> 03:02:38.033
MATT: All right, you walk over and cast Decompose.
The beetles have made rather quick work of all of

03:02:38.033 --> 03:02:46.425
the eyes and elements of softer flesh, and as you
cast Decompose, the body softens a bit and the

03:02:46.425 --> 03:02:53.471
gaps in the back where the rigid structure had
left air between itself and the ground come to

03:02:53.471 --> 03:02:59.723
close as the body sloughs a bit off of its
tightened structure. You watch quickly as where it

03:02:59.723 --> 03:03:05.684
normally was very rocky terrain, bits of green
begin to emerge: vines seem to slowly wrap up over

03:03:05.684 --> 03:03:10.660
parts of its dead form, and within bits of the
wounds that you guys had left in it from your

03:03:10.660 --> 03:03:18.515
various hacks and attacks against its body, you
see bits of reddish fungus begin to pop out and

03:03:18.515 --> 03:03:22.892
fill the various wounds. Nothing too intense, it
begins the process.

03:03:22.892 --> 03:03:26.735
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a handful and give it
a smell. (sniff) Mmm. Look at that, he's useful

03:03:26.735 --> 03:03:28.929
now. That's good; that's so good.

03:03:28.929 --> 03:03:30.372
LAURA: Blood fungus!

03:03:30.372 --> 03:03:32.418
TALIESIN: Ah! I'm going to go get back on the
cart.

03:03:32.418 --> 03:03:38.510
SAM: Is there anything on the giant's body? Worthy
of stealing?

03:03:38.510 --> 03:03:39.685
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:03:39.685 --> 03:03:42.145
TALIESIN: Oh man. Dig your fingers into it.

03:03:42.145 --> 03:03:42.720
SAM: 24.

03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:45.908
MATT: 24? You loot through his body.

03:03:45.908 --> 03:03:47.241
LAURA: Ew!

03:03:47.241 --> 03:03:53.864
MATT: You find eight gold pieces, 34 silver
pieces, and half of an eaten goat that was

03:03:53.864 --> 03:03:57.271
dangling from the back of its belt.

03:03:57.271 --> 03:03:59.338
SAM: I'll take that.

03:03:59.338 --> 03:04:01.791
TALIESIN: Goat meat's great.

03:04:01.791 --> 03:04:08.328
MATT: Well, it's great when it's fresh. You can
smell the week of ripening that this half-goat has

03:04:08.328 --> 03:04:09.378
been through.

03:04:10.388 --> 03:04:14.144
TALIESIN: There's a lot of medieval cooking that
would want the meat to get a little gamy, I'm just

03:04:14.144 --> 03:04:16.413
saying. Sometimes it improves the flavor.

03:04:16.413 --> 03:04:21.630
SAM: I flick off some of the beetles off of the
goat meat. That's mine! Get off!

03:04:21.630 --> 03:04:31.033
MATT: The beetles eventually recoil back into the
staff. So you guys gather yourselves back up into

03:04:31.033 --> 03:04:35.677
the cart, keeping a very close eye on the rest of
the walls of this gorge as you continue your

03:04:35.677 --> 03:04:42.943
journey. You push beyond this brief encounter. So
it's about four and a half days of travel to Nicodranas.

03:04:42.975 --> 03:04:44.005
SAM: From here?

03:04:44.005 --> 03:04:44.746
MATT: From here.

03:04:44.746 --> 03:04:46.450
SAM: Jesus, we're going halfway across the world!

03:04:46.450 --> 03:04:48.073
MATT: You're traveling a long way, man.

03:04:48.073 --> 03:04:50.543
LIAM: How long did it take for Caleb to come out
of that?

03:04:50.543 --> 03:04:52.436
MATT: It took about a minute.

03:04:52.436 --> 03:04:56.903
LIAM: A minute. I should probably stop doing
that.

03:04:56.903 --> 03:04:59.606
MARISHA: (straining) Ugh. Can I set you down now?

03:04:59.606 --> 03:05:02.631
LIAM: Okay.

03:05:02.631 --> 03:05:03.790
MARISHA: I'm going to set you down now.

03:05:03.790 --> 03:05:07.594
LIAM: Okay. Let's go catch the cart.

03:05:07.594 --> 03:05:14.991
MATT: You guys rush up and hop into the cart,
continuing your journey. For this next day or so,

03:05:14.991 --> 03:05:17.319
Caduceus, make a perception check for me, please.

03:05:17.319 --> 03:05:18.097
LAURA: I'll help you.

03:05:18.097 --> 03:05:18.974
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:20.978
MATT: With advantage, with Jester's aid, yes.

03:05:20.978 --> 03:05:30.374
TALIESIN: Let's try a new die. Oh, that's not bad.
That's a 17. It'll do.

03:05:30.374 --> 03:05:36.860
MATT: All righty. Keeping an eye out, you peruse
the interior of the gorge for the remainder of its

03:05:37.122 --> 03:05:42.091
length. Eventually, the mountain gives way towards
the end of your day's journey. You don't notice

03:05:42.091 --> 03:05:47.336
anything waiting in the wings on par with what you
had seen before. There are some mountain wolves

03:05:47.336 --> 03:05:52.952
that wander down in a pack that notice your
presence, but don't seem to bother. They tend to

03:05:52.952 --> 03:06:00.076
avoid the main road at this point. Eventually, you
make your way past the dry, rocky plains just as

03:06:00.076 --> 03:06:05.810
the sun begins to set. You can see to the left of
you, the Ashkeeper Peaks that continue to curl off

03:06:05.810 --> 03:06:14.291
to the horizon; the hills growing taller and more
scattered across the plain in front of you to

03:06:14.291 --> 03:06:19.116
where you can't see beyond the first set. But the
landscape seems to be dipping a bit beyond that,

03:06:19.116 --> 03:06:25.075
so each hill itself marks the horizon ahead of you
for however long you have to travel. First night

03:06:25.075 --> 03:06:31.397
rest, as you were keeping watch, no major issue.
As the morning comes to, you all begin to wake up

03:06:31.397 --> 03:06:34.228
to the sound of approaching hoofprints.

03:06:39.738 --> 03:06:46.326
LIAM: A thought I had earlier; point of order--
the first time I did the hut, it was bright

03:06:46.326 --> 03:06:50.475
orange, but I've learned that I can control that,
so through experimentation, I would say if we are

03:06:50.475 --> 03:06:56.560
ever in a field of grass, the hut would be the
color, as close as Caleb can get it, to the grass.

03:06:56.560 --> 03:07:00.908
It wouldn't be mottled or anything, it would be
still slightly abnormal because it would be one

03:07:00.908 --> 03:07:06.661
solid color. If we are in a stony area, I would
try to match the gray. Just something I add to my routine.

03:07:06.796 --> 03:07:13.407
MATT: Easy enough. As you guys come to and wake
up, off the side of the main path, you glance over

03:07:13.618 --> 03:07:24.069
to the right, and you can see, from the sound of
hoof prints, two carts, 30 or 40 feet off the

03:07:24.069 --> 03:07:32.160
side, heading up the road. At the front, you see
a-- I wouldn't say cloaked, but hooded man with a

03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:39.295
head wrap that falls into a scarf over one
shoulder, a long, gray-and-gold set of comfortable

03:07:39.295 --> 03:07:45.233
travel robes sat at the front, who's looking over
in your direction. In the back of the cart, you

03:07:45.233 --> 03:07:50.272
see numerous sizes of metallic cages of some
kind.

03:07:50.272 --> 03:07:53.457
LAURA: Are there people in them?

03:07:53.457 --> 03:07:54.909
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:07:54.909 --> 03:07:57.024
SAM: It's a zoo. It's a traveling zoo.

03:07:57.024 --> 03:08:00.723
LAURA: 19.

03:08:00.723 --> 03:08:05.931
MATT: 19. No people. You do see a number of
creatures; little animals.

03:08:05.931 --> 03:08:07.502
SAM: It's a traveling zoo!

03:08:07.502 --> 03:08:08.780
LAURA: What kind of creatures?

03:08:08.780 --> 03:08:10.003
MARISHA: Maybe it's a petting zoo.

03:08:10.003 --> 03:08:14.951
MATT: At this distance, you can see a number of
small, feathered, winged creatures on perches on

03:08:14.951 --> 03:08:23.825
the inside of one cage. You can see on the back
cart-- just from this distance, you can't make out

03:08:23.825 --> 03:08:30.347
too much from this, but you can see two small,
furred creatures that are both circling each other

03:08:30.347 --> 03:08:32.469
in the cage in the back.

03:08:32.469 --> 03:08:34.222
TRAVIS: Let's go take a look.

03:08:34.222 --> 03:08:36.668
MARISHA: Is he stopped, or is he moving?

03:08:36.668 --> 03:08:41.006
MATT: He's moving. Just glancing over, and
noticing this weird, green dome off to the side.

03:08:41.006 --> 03:08:42.130
TRAVIS: Call to him.

03:08:42.130 --> 03:08:44.909
MARISHA: Good day!

03:08:44.909 --> 03:08:48.335
MATT: Do you emerge from the dome?

03:08:48.335 --> 03:08:50.621
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Morning!

03:08:50.621 --> 03:08:52.421
MATT: "Good morning."

03:08:52.421 --> 03:08:56.258
LAURA: Do you have animals in there?

03:08:56.258 --> 03:08:58.333
MATT: "Yes?"

03:08:58.333 --> 03:09:00.488
LAURA: Did you-- Are they nice?

03:09:00.488 --> 03:09:05.475
MATT: "They are very nice, they are very young,
and they are ripe for finding someone who would

03:09:05.475 --> 03:09:08.687
"wish to give them the attention and training they
deserve."

03:09:08.687 --> 03:09:11.310
LAURA: (gasp) Wait, wait, wait! Can we pet them?

03:09:11.310 --> 03:09:16.312
MATT: "No, but you may look to purchase if you're
interested."

03:09:16.312 --> 03:09:18.645
LAURA: Okay! I run over.

03:09:18.645 --> 03:09:21.675
TRAVIS: Look to purchase, Jester! Just look!

03:09:21.675 --> 03:09:24.048
TALIESIN: I got to see this, I'm getting up.

03:09:24.048 --> 03:09:25.260
MARISHA: I go over as well.

03:09:25.260 --> 03:09:29.166
MATT: You all begin to walk over. As you all begin
to approach, he's like, "Whoa," pulls on the

03:09:29.166 --> 03:09:34.223
reins, and the horses come to a stop. You look,
and it's one man. This gentleman as you approach,

03:09:34.223 --> 03:09:43.140
he's heavier-set, with very tan, sun-weathered
skin, the folds of his neck just barely peering

03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:48.188
past the wrap over his neck, but he seems
relatively positive and jolly when you approach.

03:09:48.188 --> 03:09:53.473
He's got this smile, and his eyes are very
welcoming. There are two other figures that are

03:09:53.473 --> 03:09:57.058
walking alongside the cart that appear to be
keepers that are just keeping an eye on the

03:09:57.058 --> 03:10:01.408
creatures. You can see there are a number of small
bags and things that contain food and general

03:10:01.408 --> 03:10:04.693
means of keeping these animals. And as you
approach and look, these animals are kept in

03:10:04.693 --> 03:10:08.075
fairly good conditions; they're not-- they don't
look abused or anything, they're just being

03:10:08.075 --> 03:10:14.915
brought. He, as they're stopping the horses, steps
off, pulls back the wrap from his head, and it's a

03:10:14.915 --> 03:10:18.839
smooth, bald head with a little bit of stubble
coming in around the sides. You can see he's

03:10:18.839 --> 03:10:24.412
mostly gone bald on the top. He smiles. "Well, it
is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am

03:10:24.412 --> 03:10:33.953
"Kestiff Drudy. I am a handler of creatures of
fantastical possible talent, and we travel along

03:10:33.953 --> 03:10:39.037
"these routes to find homes for these majestic
creatures. If you are looking to purchase, we can

03:10:39.037 --> 03:10:41.397
"give you a quick view of our wares."

03:10:41.397 --> 03:10:42.534
LIAM: Did you say Drudy?

03:10:42.534 --> 03:10:44.542
MATT: "Kestiff Drudy."

03:10:44.542 --> 03:10:46.336
TALIESIN: I am so excited for a show.

03:10:46.336 --> 03:10:50.673
LIAM: By the way, Caleb has stayed behind. He has
no interest; he is keeping the hut up and petting

03:10:50.673 --> 03:10:52.935
his own cat and watching.

03:10:52.935 --> 03:10:59.220
SAM: I'm going to, I guess, stay far, far back.
Just watching from a hidden position.

03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:01.723
TRAVIS: Kestiff, where are you coming from and
where are you heading?

03:11:01.723 --> 03:11:08.207
MATT: "Oh, well, I had previously been traveling
from Port Damali and making our way from port town

03:11:08.207 --> 03:11:13.711
"to port town. We had just left from Nicodranas
and are making our way upwards, hopefully to

03:11:13.711 --> 03:11:17.153
"Rexxentrum, with the various creatures we have."

03:11:17.153 --> 03:11:23.740
LAURA: Ooh. You might not want to go that way.
There's a lot of guards blocking the entrance into

03:11:23.740 --> 03:11:24.560
the Empire.

03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:26.322
MATT: "Why would they block it?"

03:11:26.322 --> 03:11:29.532
LAURA: There's a war going on, didn't you know?

03:11:29.532 --> 03:11:32.531
MATT: "I heard about that, but do they not want
commerce?"

03:11:32.531 --> 03:11:37.611
TALIESIN: Well, you're going to probably get
rustled a bit, but I'm sure they'll let you in eventually.

03:11:37.625 --> 03:11:41.782
MATT: "We are carrying nothing illegal. We have
been very particular to make sure the creatures we

03:11:41.782 --> 03:11:48.249
"bring across are within the legalities of the
Empire. Should not be a problem, but appreciate

03:11:48.249 --> 03:11:48.985
"the warning."

03:11:48.985 --> 03:11:51.465
LAURA: What kind of animals do you have? I want
one.

03:11:52.211 --> 03:11:57.847
MATT: "Well!" and giving a display, the two other
helpers begin opening one cage in the far back,

03:11:57.847 --> 03:12:03.019
and you can see the two creatures they pull on the
side as they walk over with two very young tiger cubs.

03:12:03.019 --> 03:12:05.180
MARISHA, LAURA and SAM: (gasp)

03:12:05.180 --> 03:12:10.328
MATT: Orange and white with black stripes across
their back. "These are twin cubs. The last of

03:12:10.328 --> 03:12:15.143
"their litter to be given birth to, naught but
about six weeks before."

03:12:15.143 --> 03:12:16.653
MARISHA: (whispering) Jester, look! Twin cubs!

03:12:16.653 --> 03:12:18.853
LIAM: Twin cups! (clinks)

03:12:18.853 --> 03:12:28.868
MATT: "If you would like to make a home for either
of these, they are 70 gold apiece. Or, if you want

03:12:28.868 --> 03:12:34.122
"to buy them as a pair, merely 120 gold."

03:12:34.122 --> 03:12:35.455
SAM: One girl, two cubs!

03:12:35.455 --> 03:12:39.121
(laughter)

03:12:39.121 --> 03:12:46.826
TRAVIS: That face. That face! Oh, that face! Look
at that face! Sweet tiger cubs, into that.

03:12:46.826 --> 03:12:48.702
LIAM: Sam, would you like an animal companion?

03:12:48.702 --> 03:12:54.221
LAURA: Well, I should probably hold them to see if
they will like me or not.

03:12:54.221 --> 03:13:00.760
MATT: "But of course. Here." Takes one cub and
hands it to you. And they look like they had woken

03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:06.928
up not long before, and they're like (tiny
growling). Big paws that are kind of oversized for

03:13:06.928 --> 03:13:12.826
their physicality. Hands the other one over to
you, and as he hands the other one over, this one

03:13:12.826 --> 03:13:16.213
is kind of climbing up your shoulder, gets a
little rambunctious and is across the back and

03:13:16.213 --> 03:13:16.869
shoulder area.

03:13:16.869 --> 03:13:17.893
MARISHA: They're so cute on you!

03:13:17.893 --> 03:13:19.340
LAURA: I mean, should we have some tigers?

03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:21.831
SAM: (laughing) "Should we have some--"

03:13:21.831 --> 03:13:24.254
MATT: "They look very happy with you, I'm not
going to lie."

03:13:24.254 --> 03:13:25.739
LAURA: I am really happy with them!

03:13:25.739 --> 03:13:28.593
TALIESIN: Perhaps there is something else.

03:13:28.593 --> 03:13:31.801
LIAM: Caleb is very judgmentally petting his cat's
head.

03:13:31.801 --> 03:13:34.889
LAURA: What else do you have, though?

03:13:34.889 --> 03:13:40.833
MATT: "We have Jamyela, who is in need of a home
and some care." And he points over to another

03:13:40.833 --> 03:13:50.152
cage, and you can see an older baboon. You can see
the orangish-red fur fading to gray. It looks

03:13:50.152 --> 03:13:55.400
older. You can see the drooping skin. It has one
arm up, holding onto a branch in the cage, and

03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:56.711
looks over and it's like--

03:13:56.711 --> 03:13:58.010
LAURA: Is he nice?

03:13:58.010 --> 03:13:59.458
MATT: (raspberry)

03:13:59.458 --> 03:14:04.442
(laughter)

03:14:04.442 --> 03:14:16.815
MATT: He goes, "Well, she is... unique. Maybe a
bit of a big personality, but overall, very useful and--"

03:14:16.865 --> 03:14:18.152
MARISHA: This is his way of saying she sucks.

03:14:18.152 --> 03:14:19.239
LAURA: How much is she, though?

03:14:19.239 --> 03:14:21.497
MATT: "45 gold for her."

03:14:21.497 --> 03:14:25.904
LAURA: Well, I could probably get all three. What
else do you have?

03:14:25.904 --> 03:14:28.177
MATT: "We have," and he turns--

03:14:28.177 --> 03:14:29.960
TALIESIN: Hit her with a Sleep spell.

03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:35.166
MATT: And you can see two of the helpers have gone
into one of the larger cages and pulled out these

03:14:35.166 --> 03:14:39.212
leather cords they keep wrapped around a finger
with these little loops that are affixed to the

03:14:39.212 --> 03:14:46.644
legs of these three smaller, kind of parrot-like
birds. "This is a blue dollop," and sets it over

03:14:46.644 --> 03:14:47.978
onto the edge there.

03:14:47.978 --> 03:14:49.247
LAURA: Oh, put it on my horn!

03:14:49.247 --> 03:14:55.976
MATT: On the horn. "This is a purple-feathered
joppie," and hands it over to you. "This is a

03:14:55.976 --> 03:15:02.854
"yellow-white kurat," and the third bird is placed
over onto your other hand. "These run about 20--

03:15:02.854 --> 03:15:07.275
"No, these are 15 gold pieces apiece for these
birds."

03:15:07.275 --> 03:15:08.206
MARISHA: That's like nothing, really.

03:15:08.206 --> 03:15:10.193
LIAM: Beau's hard shell drops.

03:15:10.193 --> 03:15:12.562
LAURA: I mean, they're basically free.

03:15:12.562 --> 03:15:13.688
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

03:15:13.688 --> 03:15:21.001
MATT: He takes the cubs from you and puts them
back in the cage. "We also have--" and points over

03:15:21.001 --> 03:15:21.727
to an owl--

03:15:21.727 --> 03:15:22.915
MARISHA: Oh my god, he's got more!

03:15:22.915 --> 03:15:28.227
MATT: You see an owl, a large owl in one of the
far back cages that is kind of like curled up. You

03:15:28.227 --> 03:15:40.323
can see in the daylight, it's now hitting the end
of its conscious cycle. The head (ratchets) and

03:15:40.323 --> 03:15:48.180
just stays in the cage. "The owl is 20 gold
pieces." You hear this (sharp call) from the back

03:15:48.180 --> 03:15:53.907
cage, and you can see this vibrant green peacock
that is in one of the further back carts.

03:15:53.907 --> 03:15:55.466
TRAVIS: That's a fucking good peacock sound!

03:15:55.466 --> 03:15:56.075
MATT: Thank you.

03:15:56.075 --> 03:15:57.061
TRAVIS: That's what they sound like!

03:15:57.061 --> 03:15:58.965
LIAM: Taliesin! Taliesin, this one's for you.

03:15:58.965 --> 03:16:02.437
MATT: You see it kind of sitting in the cage--

03:16:02.437 --> 03:16:03.530
TALIESIN: They're bastards, those birds.

03:16:03.530 --> 03:16:11.260
MATT: Yeah, they're dicks. It's sitting there in
the cage. "The peacock will run you 40 gold pieces

03:16:11.260 --> 03:16:16.857
"to purchase. We have, in that cage over there--"
And you see this long branch twisted up the side.

03:16:16.857 --> 03:16:22.759
"Eh, he's not awa-- Come on, show yourself." He
takes a little stick out of the side and pokes the

03:16:22.759 --> 03:16:29.349
log. You see (scramble) up on the log, this tiny,
crimson-colored weasel: this long weasel-creature.

03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:31.808
"This is a crimson weasel."

03:16:31.808 --> 03:16:36.977
TALIESIN: You can make him a little mask and then
he'd be the Crimson Weasel.

03:16:36.977 --> 03:16:40.505
MATT: "This is 20 gold pieces for the crimson
weasel--"

03:16:40.505 --> 03:16:45.152
LAURA: Wait, I need to hold the weasel. I'm
thinking about buying the weasel.

03:16:45.152 --> 03:16:49.843
MATT: They go ahead and take the bird off of your
horn and begin to retrieve the other birds off of

03:16:49.843 --> 03:16:51.209
Beau and take them back to the cage.

03:16:51.209 --> 03:16:53.974
MARISHA: Can I trade you these two birds for that
owl? Can I hold the owl?

03:16:53.974 --> 03:16:58.657
MATT: He goes over and opens the owl cage, gets a
heavy leather glove on--

03:16:58.657 --> 03:17:00.925
LAURA: I feel like I'm really holding these
animals.

03:17:00.925 --> 03:17:01.665
MARISHA: I know!

03:17:01.665 --> 03:17:06.864
MATT: Gets a heavy leather glove on, and then
reaches in to get the owl, and it takes about

03:17:06.864 --> 03:17:10.565
three or four minutes to eventually nudge it to
get onto the arm, and the owl is just fucking not

03:17:10.565 --> 03:17:12.703
having any of it, and is like, "(growl) No."

03:17:12.703 --> 03:17:18.195
LAURA: Wait, if you buy the owl and I buy a
weasel, is your owl going to eat my weasel?

03:17:18.195 --> 03:17:19.913
MARISHA: Will the owl eat the weasels?

03:17:19.913 --> 03:17:22.662
MATT: "There is a reason we keep them in separate
cages, yes."

03:17:22.662 --> 03:17:24.699
MARISHA: Well, can we teach them to be friends?

03:17:24.699 --> 03:17:30.285
MATT: "That is up to you. I cannot guarantee
success in this endeavor, but you are welcome to

03:17:30.285 --> 03:17:36.094
"try. Being a natural predator of the crimson
weasel, I would not recommend it. But it is your purchase."

03:17:36.730 --> 03:17:38.167
MARISHA: I kind of like a challenge.

03:17:38.167 --> 03:17:39.882
TRAVIS: That's going to be a dead pet.

03:17:39.882 --> 03:17:43.994
LAURA: I don't want him to eat my weasel, though.
Can I hold it?

03:17:43.994 --> 03:17:45.842
TRAVIS: How many times did you hear that at your
mom's house?

03:17:45.842 --> 03:17:50.738
MATT: Brings the weasel over. There is a leather
leash on the weasel, hands it over to you. The

03:17:50.823 --> 03:17:57.506
weasel climbs up your arm. Immediately, it hits
you: the smell is not pleasant. But not terrible,

03:17:57.506 --> 03:18:03.955
either. It's definitely-- Definitely a smell of...
of creature, is the best way I can describe it.

03:18:03.955 --> 03:18:06.494
LAURA: Kind of like a mix between Nott and Caleb.

03:18:06.494 --> 03:18:10.788
MATT: Yeah. It's almost citrusy, but like
fermented citrus.

03:18:10.788 --> 03:18:12.382
MARISHA: Ferret smell.

03:18:12.382 --> 03:18:17.146
MATT: Similar to a ferret smell, kind of? It makes
its way up the arm and curls up and nestles into

03:18:17.146 --> 03:18:18.997
you. It's pretty soft.

03:18:18.997 --> 03:18:19.487
LAURA: Ah!

03:18:20.947 --> 03:18:28.722
MATT: "We have one more. This, er... this is a
trained creature, because we have to train them

03:18:28.722 --> 03:18:36.563
"initially, or we cannot keep it with us." He turns
around and pulls out the side a tiny little puppy.

03:18:36.563 --> 03:18:39.765
It's like, a soft, kind of brown puppy with a bit
of full--

03:18:39.765 --> 03:18:44.502
TRAVIS: What are you doing? Are you crazy?! What
the fuck is the matter with you?!

03:18:44.502 --> 03:18:46.851
MATT: He goes, "This one is 100 gold pieces."

03:18:46.851 --> 03:18:48.613
LAURA: What can it do? What is it trained to do?

03:18:48.613 --> 03:18:53.463
MATT: "Well, it is trained to stay within its
cage. Because when it gets excited--" and he pulls

03:18:53.463 --> 03:18:57.933
it over towards you and the tail kind of wags, and
then it (poof) vanishes from his hand, and then

03:18:57.933 --> 03:18:59.140
(poof) appears on the ground next to you--

03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:01.853
LIAM: (gasp) Blink dog! Blink-- Motherfucking
blink dog! I mean, I'm not there. (pigeon cooing)

03:19:01.853 --> 03:19:04.083
(laughter)

03:19:04.083 --> 03:19:07.121
MATT: Appears on the ground next to you, and is
like, "Arf. Arf, arf!" and kind of curls up and

03:19:07.121 --> 03:19:09.210
starts nibbling on your boot.

03:19:09.210 --> 03:19:10.754
LAURA: How much is this one?!

03:19:10.754 --> 03:19:11.855
MATT: "It is 100 gold pieces."

03:19:11.855 --> 03:19:14.595
LAURA: 100 gold! For a cute blinky dog?!

03:19:16.045 --> 03:19:21.437
MARISHA: Is the owl the natural predator of blink
dogs? Or would the owl--

03:19:21.437 --> 03:19:24.713
MATT: "No. The dog is too-- the dog will get
larger, I will warn you. It gets to--"

03:19:24.713 --> 03:19:26.032
MARISHA: Will the dog eat the owl?

03:19:26.032 --> 03:19:28.476
MATT: "Probably not, unless it--"

03:19:28.476 --> 03:19:29.791
MARISHA: How much for the dog and the owl?

03:19:29.791 --> 03:19:32.842
LAURA: I want the dog for sure. Yes.

03:19:32.842 --> 03:19:34.142
TRAVIS: You're getting an owl?

03:19:34.142 --> 03:19:38.733
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a bird of prey that you have
to wear a glove to handle. How awesome is that?

03:19:38.733 --> 03:19:40.685
TRAVIS: What do you do with an owl during a
fight?

03:19:40.685 --> 03:19:41.410
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:19:41.410 --> 03:19:45.047
LAURA: How much is the weasel again? How much for
the weasel?

03:19:45.047 --> 03:19:52.291
MATT: "The crimson weasel is 20 gold pieces. The
blink puppy is 100 gold pieces."

03:19:52.291 --> 03:19:55.104
TALIESIN: Taliesin and Caduceus have very
conflicting feelings right now.

03:19:55.104 --> 03:19:56.215
TRAVIS: Have you ever eaten tiger before?

03:19:56.215 --> 03:20:00.281
LAURA: We should split the dog, and we can have a
pet together, and he can room with us whenever we

03:20:00.281 --> 03:20:03.729
go anywhere. And then you can get your owl--

03:20:03.729 --> 03:20:06.835
TALIESIN: I've never been so disappointed to have
rolled a vegetarian character in my entire life.

03:20:06.835 --> 03:20:11.691
MARISHA: You're going to get the weasel too, okay.
Here's my question: what do we do with all these

03:20:11.691 --> 03:20:12.190
animals?

03:20:12.190 --> 03:20:13.615
(laughter)

03:20:13.615 --> 03:20:15.253
MATT: That's a very good question.

03:20:15.253 --> 03:20:17.368
SAM: We're going to get them, but what do we do?

03:20:17.368 --> 03:20:18.429
MARISHA: But then what?

03:20:18.429 --> 03:20:21.146
LIAM: Why did you put this in front of us, Matt?
Why?

03:20:21.146 --> 03:20:24.565
MATT: You know exactly why. Because it's funny!

03:20:24.565 --> 03:20:27.040
(laughter)

03:20:27.040 --> 03:20:27.819
LAURA: I don't know.

03:20:27.819 --> 03:20:30.960
MARISHA: I don't, either. We could get them and
just figure it out as we go.

03:20:30.960 --> 03:20:33.225
LAURA: We could figure it out. We'll have pets.

03:20:33.225 --> 03:20:37.275
TRAVIS: You're going to lose that puppy. It's
going to blink itself off a cliff and you're never

03:20:37.275 --> 03:20:40.861
going to be the same. You're going to be
devastated.

03:20:40.861 --> 03:20:42.213
LIAM: No, that blink dog is cool!

03:20:42.213 --> 03:20:44.156
MARISHA: Just watch it die.

03:20:44.156 --> 03:20:48.639
TALIESIN: You guys all right? Is this all on the
level? I'm just going to check with the animals

03:20:48.639 --> 03:20:49.940
that everything is copacetic.

03:20:49.940 --> 03:20:52.768
MATT: Yeah, make a nature check.

03:20:55.818 --> 03:20:56.812
TALIESIN: 12.

03:20:56.812 --> 03:21:01.171
MATT: 12. Looking over all of them, all the
animals are well-kept.

03:21:01.171 --> 03:21:02.889
TALIESIN: I mean, I asked them.

03:21:02.889 --> 03:21:04.721
MATT: Yeah. Oh, you asked them?

03:21:04.721 --> 03:21:10.403
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I just asked them.

03:21:10.403 --> 03:21:14.458
MATT: "We are very particular to make sure the
creatures are well-kept and comfortable, well-fed,

03:21:14.458 --> 03:21:17.046
"and are of the utmost quality of presentation.
These are not—"

03:21:17.046 --> 03:21:18.735
TALIESIN: Do the animals seem like they're cool
with this too? I was talking to the animals

03:21:18.735 --> 03:21:19.695
MATT: Oh, you were talking to the animals. I'm
sorry.

03:21:19.695 --> 03:21:23.678
TALIESIN: That's all right.

03:21:23.678 --> 03:21:24.432
LIAM: Think how effective an animal companion was
when you were a ranger, and now you have none of

03:21:24.432 --> 03:21:26.617
those skills.

03:21:26.617 --> 03:21:29.453
MATT: The best that you can make out from them,
they—

03:21:29.453 --> 03:21:30.373
TALIESIN: They're not freaking out at me?

03:21:30.373 --> 03:21:33.673
MATT: No, they're enjoying the fresh air.

03:21:33.673 --> 03:21:35.221
TALIESIN: Sure. All right.

03:21:35.221 --> 03:21:39.583
MATT: And the attention. Mostly. The owl doesn't
want to fucking deal with any of you.

03:21:39.583 --> 03:21:40.326
TALIESIN: I feel that.

03:21:40.326 --> 03:21:41.863
MARISHA: Is the owl on me? I have the owl?

03:21:41.863 --> 03:21:42.566
MATT: Yeah.

03:21:42.566 --> 03:21:45.514
MARISHA: Do I have the glove on? Do I have the
dope glove?

03:21:45.514 --> 03:21:46.639
MATT: No, he didn't give you the glove.

03:21:46.639 --> 03:21:48.155
MARISHA: He didn't give me the glove? I just have
him?

03:21:48.155 --> 03:21:49.000
LIAM: You could take it, though.

03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:49.902
MARISHA: But I've got my wraps.

03:21:49.902 --> 03:21:52.211
MATT: Yeah. Well, you have your bracers.

03:21:52.211 --> 03:21:53.968
MARISHA: I have awesome bracers.

03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:56.147
TRAVIS: He's talon into forearm, let's just be
honest.

03:21:56.147 --> 03:21:57.810
MARISHA: Does it look cool on my bracers?

03:21:57.810 --> 03:22:01.099
LAURA: He looks as pissed as you look all the
time.

03:22:01.099 --> 03:22:03.384
MARISHA: Yeah, right? Yeah? Can I pet?

03:22:03.384 --> 03:22:04.820
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

03:22:04.820 --> 03:22:07.392
TRAVIS: Oh, don't lose that fucking digit.

03:22:07.392 --> 03:22:09.421
MARISHA: Oh god, he's going to eat my—

03:22:09.421 --> 03:22:11.568
LIAM: This is revenge for all the times Dagon bit
us.

03:22:11.568 --> 03:22:13.079
MATT: That's cocked. Yeah, roll again.

03:22:13.079 --> 03:22:15.010
LIAM: Damn it.

03:22:15.010 --> 03:22:15.733
MARISHA: 16.

03:22:15.733 --> 03:22:16.509
MATT: 16?

03:22:16.509 --> 03:22:18.578
LAURA: Pretty good.

03:22:18.578 --> 03:22:24.085
MATT: You go to pet it, and as your hand gets
close, it rears back and opens its beak a bit, and

03:22:24.085 --> 03:22:30.678
you pet it, and the eyes squint very tightly, and
then eventually it's--

03:22:30.678 --> 03:22:33.446
MARISHA: Scritches, yeah, scritches.

03:22:33.446 --> 03:22:37.800
MATT: The feathers furl up a little bit and it
tends to poof. It seems like it's enjoying it

03:22:37.800 --> 03:22:42.598
begrudgingly, like it's really trying not to but
it's like, oh, this does feel good.

03:22:42.598 --> 03:22:45.556
MARISHA: Oh, we're so much alike.

03:22:45.556 --> 03:22:49.072
LAURA: You should have it, and just keep him on
your shoulder all the time.

03:22:49.072 --> 03:22:52.370
MARISHA: Yeah, I can train him to fly and come
back to me, and be cool.

03:22:53.571 --> 03:22:56.226
TRAVIS: Now Beau, you know a pet is a lot of
responsibility.

03:22:56.226 --> 03:22:57.503
(laughter)

03:22:57.503 --> 03:23:02.018
TALIESIN: I'm so glad that this is happening.

03:23:02.479 --> 03:23:06.115
TRAVIS: I just want you to understand, you're
going to have to feed it, take care of it, clean

03:23:06.115 --> 03:23:07.123
up after it.

03:23:07.123 --> 03:23:08.843
MARISHA: I know, Fjord!

03:23:08.843 --> 03:23:13.807
LIAM: And I take out a little metal wire, and I
add to this conversation and say, you are

03:23:13.807 --> 03:23:16.556
responsible for this animal's stealth checks.

03:23:16.556 --> 03:23:17.959
MARISHA: Get out of my head.

03:23:17.959 --> 03:23:22.534
(laughter)

03:23:22.534 --> 03:23:25.267
MATT: "If you are not interested, please let us
know. We do have travel to get—"

03:23:25.267 --> 03:23:26.624
LAURA: No, no, I want the weasel!

03:23:26.624 --> 03:23:27.752
MARISHA: I want the owl!

03:23:27.752 --> 03:23:30.014
MATT: "Weasel. Owl. All right."

03:23:30.014 --> 03:23:31.388
TRAVIS: You're leaving the puppy behind?

03:23:31.388 --> 03:23:34.250
MATT: "20 gold pieces from each of you."

03:23:34.250 --> 03:23:37.331
TRAVIS: You're leaving the sweet-- you're leaving
the puppy behind?

03:23:37.331 --> 03:23:38.747
LAURA: No, we're going to get the dog, too.

03:23:38.747 --> 03:23:40.072
MARISHA: And we're going to split the cost of the
dog.

03:23:40.072 --> 03:23:42.479
MATT: "All right. That is 140 gold total."

03:23:42.479 --> 03:23:45.738
MARISHA: Okay. This is so many--

03:23:45.738 --> 03:23:48.450
(laughter)

03:23:48.450 --> 03:23:50.539
MATT: That's 70 gold each. 60 gold each.

03:23:50.539 --> 03:23:51.835
LAURA: 60 gold each.

03:23:51.835 --> 03:23:56.276
MATT: No, wait, hold on. (counting) So it's 140,
so it is 70 gold each.

03:23:56.276 --> 03:23:59.007
TALIESIN: This is going to make a giant alligator
so happy.

03:23:59.007 --> 03:24:02.413
TRAVIS: Can we start a pool about which animal
dies first?

03:24:02.413 --> 03:24:03.106
TALIESIN: Weasel.

03:24:03.106 --> 03:24:04.243
TRAVIS: Or lost. Just lost.

03:24:04.243 --> 03:24:04.999
LIAM: Weasel.

03:24:04.999 --> 03:24:09.359
LIAM: This is-- in my daughter's campaign of
eight-year-olds, all the girls are like, "Can I

03:24:09.359 --> 03:24:12.352
have a pet?" It's just like that with these two.

03:24:12.352 --> 03:24:12.927
MATT: Yeah.

03:24:12.927 --> 03:24:14.394
TRAVIS:You did this. You did this.

03:24:14.394 --> 03:24:17.311
MATT: Yeah, I did. All right, so Jester has a
crimson weasel.

03:24:17.311 --> 03:24:18.993
LAURA: I have a weasel!

03:24:18.993 --> 03:24:21.768
MARISHA: What's the name of my dope owl? What's he
called?

03:24:21.768 --> 03:24:23.617
MATT: "Whatever you want to call him."

03:24:23.617 --> 03:24:26.691
MARISHA: But what's his breed? What's his color?

03:24:26.691 --> 03:24:28.376
LAURA: He's a white owl? He's a barn owl?

03:24:28.376 --> 03:24:36.021
MATT: He'd be more akin visually to a great horned
owl, except for, because it comes from a more

03:24:36.021 --> 03:24:43.657
temperate region, here on the Menagerie coast, the
feathers are more lithe. The body is less large,

03:24:43.657 --> 03:24:49.401
and it's more elongated and thin, and the tail
feathers are a little longer, and the beak itself

03:24:49.401 --> 03:24:55.570
has a very, very sharp-- like more than usual
sharp.

03:24:55.570 --> 03:24:56.727
TRAVIS: He's got a fucking scar over his eye.

03:24:56.727 --> 03:24:58.421
(laughter)

03:24:58.421 --> 03:25:01.405
TALIESIN: Got a tattoo on his left wing.

03:25:01.405 --> 03:25:04.910
MATT: You watch as he pulls up and goes
(inhales).

03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:06.729
TALIESIN: Just Icarus tattooed on his wing.

03:25:06.729 --> 03:25:09.190
TRAVIS: He's got a spiderweb right in the armpit.

03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:15.628
MATT: All right, so that's 140 gold away. "And I'm
going to warn you--"

03:25:15.628 --> 03:25:16.265
LAURA: Okay.

03:25:16.265 --> 03:25:23.076
MATT: "--this puppy is rambunctious and--" As he's
making the transaction. He's not going to tell you

03:25:23.076 --> 03:25:33.517
after the fact like a tool. "You must be diligent
and begin to train it to know who is home. Or else

03:25:33.517 --> 03:25:34.976
you lose it."

03:25:34.976 --> 03:25:36.080
LAURA: (gasps)

03:25:36.080 --> 03:25:37.870
MATT: "So begin training it now."

03:25:37.870 --> 03:25:39.863
LAURA: What should we name him?

03:25:39.863 --> 03:25:44.155
MARISHA: Oh no. What do we name him?

03:25:44.155 --> 03:25:45.194
TRAVIS: It's too much.

03:25:45.194 --> 03:25:46.585
LAURA: Nugget.

03:25:46.585 --> 03:25:52.109
MARISHA: I'm not against it. Yeah. Nugget.

03:25:52.109 --> 03:25:57.997
MATT: Nugget the blink dog. All right, so mark
that somewhere. You have your crimson weasel, you

03:25:57.997 --> 03:25:59.081
have your owl.

03:25:59.081 --> 03:26:01.252
LIAM: Yeah, what about the owl and the weasel?

03:26:01.252 --> 03:26:02.409
MARISHA: I'll think about it.

03:26:02.409 --> 03:26:03.545
LIAM: Nothing is more important than this.

03:26:03.545 --> 03:26:07.284
MATT: "There is no rush. Thank you very much for
your commerce. If there is no other purchases, we

03:26:07.284 --> 03:26:08.683
will continue our journey northward."

03:26:08.683 --> 03:26:10.066
LAURA: Nugget.

03:26:10.066 --> 03:26:10.846
TALIESIN: Good luck to you.

03:26:10.846 --> 03:26:13.007
MATT: All right, you as well, tall friend.

03:26:13.007 --> 03:26:13.999
LAURA: We are home.

03:26:13.999 --> 03:26:16.933
MATT: "All right. Put it up." Everyone gets back
into the carts, puts the rest of the creatures

03:26:16.933 --> 03:26:17.498
away.

03:26:17.498 --> 03:26:18.904
LAURA: What do we feed them?

03:26:18.904 --> 03:26:22.912
MARISHA: Yeah, what do I feed it? Can we get a
carrying crate?

03:26:22.912 --> 03:26:30.646
MATT: The carts roll to a stop and (whistles), one
of the hands comes over, and this younger woman,

03:26:30.646 --> 03:26:35.009
the one who's been helping with the birds, comes
over with two small satchels. One, hands it to

03:26:35.009 --> 03:26:40.914
you, and it is filled with about ten dried-out rat
corpses.

03:26:40.914 --> 03:26:42.820
MARISHA: Mice, yeah. Cool.

03:26:42.820 --> 03:26:45.800
LAURA: Don't let Nott find that.

03:26:45.800 --> 03:26:52.278
MATT: The other one is filled with what looks to
be bits of dried jerky and dried fruit.

03:26:52.278 --> 03:26:54.382
LAURA: Is that for the dog or—

03:26:54.382 --> 03:26:59.336
MATT: For the dog and/or the weasel, based on what
you want to do. The cart continues northward and

03:26:59.336 --> 03:27:00.891
is out of your periphery.

03:27:00.891 --> 03:27:03.450
TRAVIS: Are you double guns weasel and dog?

03:27:03.450 --> 03:27:05.825
LAURA: I've got the weasel up here and the dog
right here.

03:27:05.825 --> 03:27:08.563
TRAVIS: What's his name? Poof? Nugget?

03:27:08.563 --> 03:27:12.572
LAURA: Nugget. And we are home. Always blink to
us.

03:27:12.572 --> 03:27:15.050
MATT: Make an animal handling check on the blink
dog.

03:27:15.050 --> 03:27:17.824
LAURA: Oh god, he's going to blink away
immediately.

03:27:17.824 --> 03:27:19.649
MARISHA: And it's gone.

03:27:19.649 --> 03:27:20.817
TRAVIS: Into a tree.

03:27:20.817 --> 03:27:24.908
LAURA: Okay. 12.

03:27:24.908 --> 03:27:27.189
MATT: 12? Okay.

03:27:27.189 --> 03:27:29.287
TRAVIS: Be cruel, Matt. Do it.

03:27:29.287 --> 03:27:34.340
MATT: It blinks out of your hand, and you feel
this weight up in your horns.

03:27:34.340 --> 03:27:35.438
LAURA: Ah!

03:27:35.438 --> 03:27:41.890
MATT: You look over and see it's slipping off of
her horn trying to hold on as its hind legs are

03:27:41.890 --> 03:27:43.465
kicking up, trying to get leverage.

03:27:43.465 --> 03:27:46.822
LAURA: We got you, it's okay! It's okay! Oh my
god, I love him!

03:27:46.822 --> 03:27:48.611
LIAM: Oh, it's so cute.

03:27:48.611 --> 03:27:50.534
MATT: (dog barks)

03:27:50.534 --> 03:27:53.024
LAURA: We have a dog. What the fuck did we just
do?

03:27:53.024 --> 03:27:55.218
MARISHA: I know, why did we do this?!

03:27:55.218 --> 03:27:57.769
LAURA: I don't know. This was like a Renn Faire
purchase.

03:27:57.769 --> 03:27:58.800
MARISHA: Yeah, it totally was!

03:27:58.800 --> 03:28:01.427
(laughter)

03:28:01.427 --> 03:28:02.968
TALIESIN: Oh, you got goldfished.

03:28:02.968 --> 03:28:09.776
LIAM: If you guys are wandering back, Caleb is
giving Jester the vaguest stink eye as he

03:28:09.776 --> 03:28:12.106
scritches Frumpkin's head.

03:28:12.106 --> 03:28:14.753
LAURA: We have a pet! We have another pet!

03:28:14.753 --> 03:28:17.429
LIAM: That is super. Good for you.

03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:20.773
TALIESIN: As soon as one of these animals runs
away, we'll actually be nine of us. That's really

03:28:20.773 --> 03:28:21.363
exciting.

03:28:21.363 --> 03:28:22.252
TRAVIS: Hey!

03:28:22.252 --> 03:28:24.988
LIAM: Why do you bring up the number of people in
the party?

03:28:24.988 --> 03:28:27.990
TALIESIN: I mean, the name of the group is kind of
a thing.

03:28:27.990 --> 03:28:28.948
LIAM: What do you mean?

03:28:28.948 --> 03:28:31.261
TALIESIN: You know, I don't know.

03:28:31.261 --> 03:28:33.205
(laughter)

03:28:33.205 --> 03:28:34.681
TALIESIN: Guess I've never really thought about
it.

03:28:34.681 --> 03:28:36.752
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ, three animals.

03:28:36.752 --> 03:28:38.521
MATT: All right, as you guys—

03:28:38.521 --> 03:28:39.470
TALIESIN: Four.

03:28:39.470 --> 03:28:41.450
MARISHA: No apartment is letting us in now, ever.

03:28:41.450 --> 03:28:42.504
MATT: Yep. Yep.

03:28:42.504 --> 03:28:44.175
(laughter)

03:28:44.175 --> 03:28:45.060
MARISHA: Cannot get approved.

03:28:45.060 --> 03:28:48.374
MATT: Nothing in the valley coming to your
attention. All right, so as you guys gather your

03:28:48.374 --> 03:28:53.299
supplies and continue southward along the road,
for the sake of brevity, we'll say for the next

03:28:53.299 --> 03:29:02.507
few days, you travel relatively uneventful,
passing the odd traveler and/or messenger riding

03:29:02.507 --> 03:29:10.679
their way up or past you at a much faster speed.
To your left, you can see the massive green

03:29:10.679 --> 03:29:22.093
jungle, this tangled jungle forest to the east
that consumes the base of the Ashkeeper Peaks all

03:29:22.093 --> 03:29:32.771
the way just out of sight to the horizon, known as
the Cuarasca Jungle. The fields and hills you

03:29:32.771 --> 03:29:39.516
follow grow darker and more dense with greenery.
The sky is more clear and a more vibrant blue than

03:29:39.516 --> 03:29:45.543
you're used to in the northern lands and the grey
skies of the empire. You follow the road over a

03:29:45.543 --> 03:29:52.830
series of rising hills until you eventually crest
the tallest, your eyes catching a beautiful-- and

03:29:52.830 --> 03:29:59.746
for some of you, an entirely new-- sight. Beneath
the cloudless blue, the horizon comes to meet an

03:29:59.746 --> 03:30:05.767
endless stretch of deep cerulean, scattered with
thousands of tiny sparkling lights, the sunlight

03:30:05.767 --> 03:30:10.356
dancing across the distant waves, giving the
illusion of a million scattered diamonds glinting

03:30:10.619 --> 03:30:16.977
across what is the Lucidian Ocean. To your left,
the dark green of the Cuarasca Jungle still

03:30:16.977 --> 03:30:22.123
dominates the countryside along the Ashkeeper
Peaks, the now hundreds of miles of lush, tangled

03:30:22.123 --> 03:30:28.272
vine canopy stretching to the shore and stopping
at the southern cliffs and beaches that give way

03:30:28.272 --> 03:30:34.642
into the endless waters. A warm breeze blows from
the south as the faint scent of salt water tickles

03:30:34.642 --> 03:30:41.775
your nose. Due just south of your hilltop,
southwest, the road continues to wind through the

03:30:41.775 --> 03:30:46.856
green hills and patchwork rocky mounds dotted with
trees and overgrowth, eventually leading to a

03:30:46.856 --> 03:30:52.619
rather large city that sits on the coast. Dozens
of boats large enough to see even at this distance

03:30:52.921 --> 03:30:57.480
cluster around the bays and docks, while the
colorful rooftops and towers vary in height and

03:30:57.480 --> 03:31:01.914
design, giving an eclectic visual of a jumble of
cultures having built this space without unified

03:31:01.914 --> 03:31:10.888
vision. To Fjord, this is a familiar sight. And to
Jester, this is home. Welcome to the Menagerie

03:31:10.888 --> 03:31:16.755
Coast, and the port city of Nicodranas. And that's
where we'll finish tonight's episode.

03:31:16.760 --> 03:31:20.214
(cheering)

03:31:20.214 --> 03:31:25.678
TRAVIS: Plus three animals. Not one, maybe two.

03:31:25.679 --> 03:31:28.151
TALIESIN: A very special episode.

03:31:28.151 --> 03:31:29.384
MARISHA: Why did we do that?

03:31:29.384 --> 03:31:30.767
LAURA: I don't know.

03:31:30.767 --> 03:31:33.078
MARISHA: I don't know why we did that. Now we've
got to think of a name!

03:31:33.370 --> 03:31:34.551
TRAVIS: Ten extra legs now.

03:31:34.551 --> 03:31:35.796
LIAM: Yeah, here, have some Tamagotchi.

03:31:35.796 --> 03:31:42.618
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah! Fuck. I really want an
over-under on how long it takes to lose one of

03:31:42.618 --> 03:31:43.857
those fucking things.

03:31:43.857 --> 03:31:47.256
LIAM: You know, Caleb doesn't like the blink dog,
but keep the blink dog, because Liam loves it.

03:31:47.256 --> 03:31:48.500
Keep the blink dog.

03:31:48.500 --> 03:31:49.993
MARISHA: It's pretty amazing.

03:31:49.993 --> 03:31:52.484
SAM: I'm going to eat one of those animals.

03:31:52.484 --> 03:31:54.415
(laughter)

03:31:54.415 --> 03:31:55.855
MARISHA: Eat the weasel!

03:31:55.855 --> 03:31:56.948
SAM: At least one.

03:31:56.948 --> 03:32:02.165
MATT: Nott now has a full-on ALF dynamic with some
of these creatures. I'm pretty excited about that.

03:32:02.165 --> 03:32:04.794
LIAM: ALF, please don't eat the blink dog.

03:32:04.794 --> 03:32:07.086
(laughter)

03:32:07.086 --> 03:32:10.336
MATT: That was fun. I'm excited to pick up in a
couple weeks, guys.

03:32:10.336 --> 03:32:12.024
SAM: A couple weeks?

03:32:12.024 --> 03:32:17.744
MATT: I know! We'll be back for the main story and
the experience of the arrival in Nicodranas the

03:32:17.744 --> 03:32:22.429
first week of September, the first Thursday of
September. Next week, however, we do have the

03:32:22.429 --> 03:32:29.041
awesome Liam O'Brien running a one-shot with these
three wonderful folks, with Laura, Travis and Sam,

03:32:29.041 --> 03:32:34.614
and two fantastic guests joining for that. So
check that out next week on Thursday.

03:32:34.614 --> 03:32:37.140
SAM: And next week is also the premiere of
Handbooker Helper, right?

03:32:37.140 --> 03:32:38.721
MATT: Next Wednesday, right?

03:32:38.721 --> 03:32:39.913
MARISHA: Wednesday.

03:32:39.913 --> 03:32:41.565
LIAM: Lot going on here.

03:32:41.565 --> 03:32:44.475
MATT: Ramping up. Getting all of our stuff in the
can.

03:32:44.475 --> 03:32:48.671
TRAVIS: And our best wishes to you three as you
disappear into the desert.

03:32:48.671 --> 03:32:52.793
MATT: Yes. Very necessary reset button.

03:32:52.793 --> 03:32:55.079
LIAM: Work hard, play hard.

03:32:55.079 --> 03:32:58.856
SAM: Don't put your dick in the peanut butter too
much.

03:32:58.856 --> 03:33:00.310
LIAM: Well.

03:33:00.310 --> 03:33:02.846
MARISHA: You always say yes to putting your dick
in--

03:33:02.846 --> 03:33:08.510
MATT: Not to that camp. I passed that camp.
I said no.

03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:12.203
LIAM: Peanut butter and playa dust, though? Nah.

03:33:12.203 --> 03:33:13.572
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's not doing it.

03:33:13.572 --> 03:33:14.667
MATT: Anyway.

03:33:14.667 --> 03:33:16.319
MARISHA: There's the PB&amp;amp;J cart, it works fine.

03:33:16.319 --> 03:33:18.759
MATT: Yeah. In your mouth.

03:33:18.759 --> 03:33:24.470
MARISHA: You eat like a fourth of a cup of playa
dust at the end of that week. At least.

03:33:24.470 --> 03:33:29.887
MATT: It becomes part of your bloodstream at that
point. Anyway, guys, have a wonderful week. We

03:33:29.902 --> 03:33:33.643
love you, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

03:33:33.643 --> 03:33:35.106
LIAM: No, it's not.

03:33:35.106 --> 03:33:36.782
TRAVIS: You fucking got pets?!

03:33:41.865 --> 03:45:26.248

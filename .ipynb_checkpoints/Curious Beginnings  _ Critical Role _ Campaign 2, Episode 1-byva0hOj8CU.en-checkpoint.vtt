00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.354
MATT: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.354 --> 00:00:03.170
(laughter)

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.071
MATT: And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:12.030
sit around and play the first game of our new
campaign of Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.002
(cheering)

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:21.294
MATT: Super excited to be back. I've missed this a
lot. Missed this-- oh, you guys will be fine. So

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:29.227
yes. Glad you guys can join us, apparently in some
crazy numbers. So welcome new viewers. Hope you

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:33.564
enjoy your stay. So, without further ado, let's
get this going so we can get through our

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:36.496
announcements. Since it is our first episode of
the year, of the campaign, I want to make sure

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:40.099
that we get our announcements out of the way.
We've got some cool stuff to talk about. First and

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:48.701
foremost, we have two sponsors tonight. Our first
sponsor-- and we're going into, for a time, a cool

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:55.204
partnership with the folks at DnD Beyond,
actually. They've been really awesome, and we've

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:59.954
been talking, and anybody who hasn't seen it, it's
an online digital tool where you can create your

00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:05.851
own D&amp;D character, they have options to purchase
any of the current D&amp;D books out there, and then

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:10.240
carry over any of the character options and racial
options over into it, so you can basically use it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.842
as a tool. We'll be using it to help us out in the
game as we go, 'cause it's actually got some pretty

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:20.262
cool stuff. So excited about that. It is D-N-D
Beyond, by the way, if you haven't seen, not the

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:21.948
ampersand. It's D-N-D.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.704
LAURA: As in nnnn.

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:29.468
MATT: Nnnn. But yeah, so they're going to be a
long-term partner for the show, so working with us

00:01:29.468 --> 00:01:35.864
through the start of this campaign. We're super
excited. But yeah. So we're excited. You can

00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:42.182
currently activate-- it should be now-- some
Critical Role content on there. They should have

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:48.754
available the Blood Hunter class that I created a
couple of years ago, kind of refining. Should be

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:53.204
available for you guys to find on the DnD Beyond,
which I'm excited about, and there's a one-time

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:58.227
discount of $10 off any digital book in the
dndbeyond.com marketplace if you use the codeword

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:04.352
'beginnings' in there right now. So yeah, get a
chance to check it out.

00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:07.321
TRAVIS: (vomiting noises) Would you like some?

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:14.495
MATT: So yeah. I'm super excited to have that,
guys. So you apply that code at checkout to make

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:19.738
that happen, in case you're confused and trying to
get it to work. There's a bunch of stuff to

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:25.388
explore on there, and a bunch of cool ways to
incorporate the existing breadth of D&amp;D lore and

00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:29.317
options in there, and now you have some of our stuff in
there as well, and hopefully more Critical Role

00:02:29.317 --> 00:02:34.053
content and Tal'Dorei content and Exandria content
down the road to also be available on there as we

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:40.828
go. Super excited about that. I'd like to thank
you guys at DnD Beyond for being awesome. We also

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:42.529
have our second sponsor. Sam, if you want to take
it away.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.898
SAM: I'm our second sponsor.

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:45.202
(laughter)

00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:46.152
LAURA: Thanks, Sam!

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:52.577
SAM: No. Welcome, new viewers. Every week-- or
many weeks, I am charged with writing the ad for

00:02:52.577 --> 00:02:59.633
the sponsor of that week. I did this one way back
in mid-December, so it'll feel a little stale.

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:03.965
(laughter)

00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:12.335
SAM: Sorry. I didn't have time to write a new one.
Apologies to our sponsor. But our second sponsor

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:19.078
tonight is Backblaze. They offer unlimited cloud
backup for Macs and PCs. You can restore from the

00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:24.252
web or via hard drive. They'll even overnight
FedEx a drive to you, and because it's Christmas

00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:32.472
season, I wrote this. 'Twas the night before
Critmas when I clicked on my mouse, but the drive

00:03:32.472 --> 00:03:39.907
wasn't whirring; it had said 'Adi-ouse'. When up
from the cloud there arose such a sight, I knew in

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:45.792
a flash that my shit was all right. As I spat out
my plate of cold chicken kiev, down my chimney

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:52.589
came a weird little elf named Lev. I said, "Whoa,
whoa, whoa, how'd you get in my place?" Lev gave

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:57.696
me a wink and punched me in the face. And suddenly
he fired up a pipe and started to restore my

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:03.690
computer from a backup he carted. My documents,
like slash fiction from My Little Pony. My photos,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.699
like me naked, covered in bologna. He mumbled that
you can get backed up at once for a merry little

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:20.565
fee of $5 a month-s. You even get 15 days free if
you scroll over to backblaze.com/criticalrole. And

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:26.631
just like that, my computer was on. Lev greased up
his body, and bam, he was gone. But I heard him

00:04:26.631 --> 00:04:32.034
exclaim, "Peace out, yo, whassup! Happy Backblaze
to all, don't forget to back up!"

00:04:32.034 --> 00:04:35.725
(cheering)

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:37.564
SAM: I'll write another one for Easter, I
promise.

00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:39.629
(laughter)

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.573
MATT: Thank you, Sam. So thank you, Backblaze.
Happy to have you for our sponsor tonight as well.

00:04:44.573 --> 00:04:49.755
Also, as a heads-up, we've had our friends at
Wyrmwood for a while have been awesomely providing

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:55.595
Wyrmwood dice boxes and dice trays and dice towers
to give away to people in the community. They have

00:04:55.595 --> 00:05:00.295
new boxes for all the players in the new campaign.
And they have been working on something for a

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:05.828
while for us to kick off the new campaign. They
made us a new table. If we can go to a camera view

00:05:05.828 --> 00:05:07.675
of this table they made for the campaign.

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:12.287
(cheering)

00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:17.864
MATT: It's made out of English brown oak, the
center Critical Role inlay is made of ash burl, is

00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:24.592
the background, and then rosewood for the d20
outline, wenge for the Critical Role words

00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:28.691
themselves, and silver stringing around the
border. It was built by hand in their

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:34.210
Massachusetts office and workshop, and it was
hand-rubbed oil on a wax finish. Over a hundred

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.992
hours were put into this table. They did an
incredible job, and we're super honored to have

00:05:37.992 --> 00:05:42.959
that here, and thank you guys for showing such an
awesome appreciation for what we do.

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.258
SAM: It smells really nice.

00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:48.341
LAURA: We have cubbies!

00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:50.905
MARISHA: It smells like wood in the studio, like
fresh wood.

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:54.201
SAM: And, when we get canceled, this is going to
be a great dining room table.

00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:59.994
MATT: This is true! Thank you guys, Wyrmwood. If
you aren't familiar with any of their stuff, go to

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:05.052
wyrmwoodgaming.com, that's W-Y-R-M-wood Gaming 
dot com. They do awesome work. It's really super

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:10.933
high-quality, it's great. So thank you guys. All
right, so. Let's see. Updates we can get through.

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:13.670
Laura, do you have an update for merch stuff in
the new year?

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.823
LAURA: (yells) Okay. Yes, I do. It's a new
campaign, new us, new merch. I don't know which

00:06:20.823 --> 00:06:22.678
camera I'm looking at.

00:06:22.678 --> 00:06:24.361
SAM: That one.

00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:31.514
LAURA: So we released our teaser on socials, and
everybody was like, "I want that as a poster!" So

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:35.021
we listened to you, and we made it a poster!

00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:38.128
(cheering)

00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.176
SAM: It's a real poster?

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:40.216
LAURA: It's a real poster!

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:41.392
SAM: Oh, wow!

00:06:41.392 --> 00:06:47.039
LAURA: Look at this lameness that you could have
on your wall! So yeah. It's in the store right

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.629
now, you guys, and we printed a small amount, so
those ones will be shipped faster, and then after

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.159
that it'll just be pre-order, but I think it's all
listed as pre-order, so just so you know.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.389
SAM: Can you photoshop out my crotch region?

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:00.602
LAURA: No.

00:07:00.602 --> 00:07:02.340
TALIESIN: That would be a lot of photoshop, man.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.110
MATT: None of us have that much talent in post,
Sam.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.907
LAURA: But let's just talk about this Matthew
Mercer.

00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:11.606
MATT: Let's not talk about what I-- when I put
that outfit on, I did not consider quite the

00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:16.633
permeation in my life it would become. So there's
that.

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:22.146
LAURA: So we can be with you always. Matt can
stare at you while you sleep.

00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:23.945
LIAM: That's actually how Purvon dressed.

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:25.446
MATT: God damn it.

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:27.969
TALIESIN: Hey, first throwback! Well done.

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:31.501
LAURA: Oh yeah. We've got to be careful, guys,
because we have a lot of people that haven't

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:36.146
watched the last campaign, or haven't finished the
last campaign, so no spoilers for last campaign.

00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:37.689
SAM: I don't really remember it.

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:38.928
TRAVIS: Well, we all died, so.

00:07:38.928 --> 00:07:44.035
MATT: That's true, yeah. Okay, next announcements:
the Critical Role podcast we have currently up to

00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:50.737
date. All of Vox Machina's story, the whole first
campaign, is now on the podcast. You can find it

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:57.207
where the finest podcasts are downloaded. And do
we have an update as far as the release schedule

00:07:57.207 --> 00:07:58.378
for this podcast?

00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:07.572
MARISHA: Yes, we do. They will be releasing one
week after we are live. We'll be one week behind.

00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:09.432
SAM: On a Thursday?

00:08:09.432 --> 00:08:11.993
MARISHA: They will be releasing on Thursdays the
week after.

00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:20.123
LAURA: Oh, so you can listen to it in the morning
and watch it live at night. If you have a lot of

00:08:20.123 --> 00:08:24.378
free time. Or a really long drive, maybe.

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:28.265
SAM: An extra eight hours to spend every
Thursday.

00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:33.401
MATT: To be fair, you guys would have about as
much free time on a Thursday as I would. Cool, so

00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:39.260
look forward to that. Comic book, issue four of
Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins, Liam, when

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.218
does that come out?

00:08:40.218 --> 00:08:42.120
LIAM: It is coming out on the 24th of this month.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.534
TRAVIS: Oh, make it sooner!

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:49.577
LIAM: I've read it. It's so good, it's real good,
it's so good. You guys, Vox Machina's story ended

00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:53.805
at this table, but it is going to live on and on
and on-- at least for three more issues.

00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:57.440
MATT: Thank you very much.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.957
TRAVIS: Check it out everywhere.

00:08:58.957 --> 00:09:09.534
LIAM: Yeah, on Zune, on PalmPilot. Darkhorse app,
Comixology, Limewire, finally.

00:09:09.534 --> 00:09:13.124
MARISHA: Napster.

00:09:13.124 --> 00:09:15.708
LAURA: I'm going to throw up.

00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:19.727
MATT: That's okay, guys, we've got a couple more
things left. Thank you for hanging in there. As

00:09:19.727 --> 00:09:23.936
far as con appearances go, I actually fly tomorrow
to Miami, Florida for Paradise City Comic Con.

00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:28.765
I'll be there tomorrow until Sunday. If you guys
are in the area, come say hi at the convention. It

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:33.366
should be fun. I have panels and signings and
stuff. Hopefully see you there. Also, I'll be at

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:39.457
Lexington Comic and Toy Con in Lexington,
Kentucky, March 9-11, Otafest in Calgary, May

00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:43.062
18-20, and A-Kon in Texas, June 7-10.

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:45.699
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise, Matt.

00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:49.101
LAURA: We have Emerald City Comic Con, me and
Travis.

00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:51.204
TRAVIS: First weekend of March.

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:58.843
MATT: Badass. Cool. All right, so. Paring it down,
finishing it up here. Thank you for your patience.

00:09:58.843 --> 00:10:05.916
With the new campaign, I want to renew our
appreciation for and make sure that we push to you

00:10:05.916 --> 00:10:10.160
guys that we, from the very beginning, have been
supporting a really amazing charity called 826,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.940
826LA being our local chapter. They have 826
groups all over the United States that they do

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.996
after-school creative writing, and a lot of great
creative classes for children who are either

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:27.461
underprivileged or don't have opportunities to go
to these types of classes. They do wonderful,

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:31.111
wonderful work, and we've been supporting them
from the very beginning, and we're just doubling

00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:35.140
down on that for this new campaign. You guys as a
community have been fantastic in supporting them,

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.230
and all the charities that we've supported from
the very beginning. Critmas every year has been a

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:44.338
very prime example of that, so I just wanted to
continue to push that forward, share the love, and

00:10:44.338 --> 00:10:49.938
a big thank-you to 826 for being such an amazing
source of creative drive for so many young kids

00:10:49.938 --> 00:10:53.359
who normally wouldn't have that opportunity. So
you guys are amazing, and show them your

00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:54.880
appreciation if you can.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.956
(cheering)

00:10:56.956 --> 00:11:02.650
MATT: Final shout-outs. One, thank you to Ian
Phillips of Iron Tusk Painting, who has painted

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.357
the miniatures for this campaign.

00:11:04.357 --> 00:11:06.670
(cheering)

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.417
MATT: He actually painted me and Marisha's cake
toppers for our wedding, and whenever you manage

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:14.671
to see them in the campaign, you can know that
it's his handiwork. Soon enough.

00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:23.520
ASHLEY: Also, fun fact about Ian Phillips: I grew
up with him. He was one of my brother's best

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.653
friends when we first moved out here to LA, and so
when that name was floating around, I was like,

00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:32.583
wait a minute. And then we reconnected back on
Instagram. It's such a crazy story. You know,

00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:34.449
Critical Role brings it all back around.

00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:36.842
(laughter)

00:11:36.842 --> 00:11:40.301
MATT: I love it. So you can follow him,
@PaintingTusk on Twitter.

00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:44.079
LIAM: I've had him paint 20 to 30-- I'm kind of
addicted-- 20 to 30 miniatures. They're amazing.

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:45.646
He's amazing at what he does.

00:11:45.646 --> 00:11:49.665
MATT: And final thank-yous to Warner Bros and
Monolith Entertainment for letting us incorporate

00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:54.763
the Shadow of War soundtrack into our Critical
Role soundtrack here on the air, so those will be

00:11:54.763 --> 00:11:59.766
coming into the new campaign. And, super excited,
CD Projekt Red has been nice enough to allow us

00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:07.068
use of the Witcher series soundtrack to also
incorporate into the campaign, which, honestly,

00:12:07.068 --> 00:12:11.195
when we started playing at home, the Witcher
soundtrack was most of my music, and I couldn't

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:15.273
use it when we started streaming, and so it's been
a cool full-circle to be able to bring it back in.

00:12:15.273 --> 00:12:20.198
Plus it brings a unique flavor that works with the
new campaign setting, so.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:25.064
With that, I believe our announcements are done.
Thank you for bearing with us.

00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:27.400
LAURA: Wait, we're going to give-- oh, that's--

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.630
MARISHA: Afterwards.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.008
SAM: There's one more announcement.

00:12:31.008 --> 00:12:39.041
MARISHA: Our announcement is our brand-new opening
title sequence. Which I think we're ready for.

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:45.872
MATT: So, as we bring it down, guys, let's go
ahead and prepare to dive in to the new year and

00:12:45.872 --> 00:12:49.302
the new campaign for this episode of Critical
Role.

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:51.912
(yelling)

00:12:51.912 --> 00:14:13.804
[80s music]

00:14:13.804 --> 00:14:17.233
(laughter)

00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:19.443
MATT: And welcome back.

00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:21.612
TRAVIS: That was a new level.

00:14:21.612 --> 00:14:26.265
MATT: We've definitely returned to the table.
Thank you, Sam. So.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:30.973
MARISHA: Wait, super fast. We've got to go through
credits. Right? Okay. So normally we don't do

00:14:30.973 --> 00:14:36.458
this, and I did this once before when we released
our other opening title sequence. Yeah, 50th. So

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:41.683
we're going to do this again. These are just
people who do so much and who do not get enough

00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:45.933
love. I'm going to shout them out. Sean Becker,
who's the unsung hero of Geek and Sundry, he's the

00:14:45.933 --> 00:14:51.900
executive producer. T.J. Rotell, he's our
production manager around here, he makes sure that

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:59.402
we actually have cameras. Maxwell James, our
producer that makes this show go every week. Dani

00:14:59.402 --> 00:15:06.598
Carr, our production coordinator, also huge
producer here. Steve Sprinkles, who directed that

00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:09.004
amazing opening title sequence.

00:15:09.004 --> 00:15:10.604
SAM: That's not a real name!

00:15:10.604 --> 00:15:14.815
MARISHA: I know. I love it on the slate. It always
says 'Sprinkles'. Jan-Michael Losada, who is our

00:15:14.815 --> 00:15:22.413
D.P., and is the same D.P. from last time. Tristan
Savage-Tate, our first A.C. Sean Delahunt, who is

00:15:22.413 --> 00:15:30.418
our key grip. Tyler Hart, who is our gaffer, who
gaffs everything around here, he's amazing. Jenny

00:15:30.418 --> 00:15:37.394
Newman, who did the amazing wardrobe. She sourced
all the wardrobe. Wren Witting, who's one of our

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:46.062
hair and makeup artists. Vanessa Marie, who is our
second hair and makeup artist. Jose Sosa, who was

00:15:46.062 --> 00:15:49.518
our production assistant. Selina Ruthe--

00:15:49.518 --> 00:15:50.961
LAURA: That's a lot of pieces of paper!

00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:54.716
MARISHA: I know. Selina Ruthe, who did additional
photography, and she also does stuff every day.

00:15:54.716 --> 00:15:56.439
LAURA: Why didn't you put them on the same piece
of paper?

00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:59.153
MARISHA: Because I didn't know there was going to
be this many. Brandon Clark, who was our location

00:15:59.153 --> 00:16:05.269
manager. Pamela Joy, who shot all the photos for
that, and Loretta Ritchert.

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:08.353
LAURA: Yeah, they're with Heirloom Photography,
and they did all of our thumbnails, too. They did

00:16:08.353 --> 00:16:09.603
that poster.

00:16:09.603 --> 00:16:11.096
ASHLEY: Go check them out on Instagram!

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:14.010
MARISHA: Jason Charles Miller, who does our
music.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.749
LIAM: Party on, Garthok!

00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:20.126
MARISHA: Sean Hudson, who does our
post-production. And Andy Inglat, who edited that

00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:24.464
thing. Okay. I'm sweating a lot.

00:16:24.464 --> 00:16:26.193
MATT: That's okay. So.

00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:28.205
SAM: What a night. Well, guys...

00:16:28.205 --> 00:16:30.509
TALIESIN: This has been great.

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:32.102
LIAM: Holy shit.

00:16:32.102 --> 00:16:34.588
MATT: Everyone. &lt;i&gt;Everyone.&lt;/i&gt;

00:16:34.588 --> 00:16:36.530
SAM: Can we open our fricking books yet?

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.161
MARISHA: Not yet.

00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:50.006
MATT: Welcome to Wildemount. The year is 835 P.D.,
or post-Divergence. This continent is divided both

00:16:50.006 --> 00:16:56.378
by jagged terrain and political powers. The
Menagerie Coast, a collection of city-states

00:16:56.378 --> 00:17:02.634
united under the Clovis Concord, monopolizes the
southwestern shores and ports of Wildemount,

00:17:02.634 --> 00:17:08.826
thriving on open trade and cultural freedom.
Beyond the Cyrios Mountains lies the massive

00:17:08.826 --> 00:17:16.580
region known as Wynandir, bisected by the
Ashkeeper Peaks. Eastern Wynandir houses the

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:22.249
expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of
Xhorhas, overrun with all manner of beasts and

00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:27.981
terrors, relics from the final battles of the
Calamity that ruined that scarred landscape.

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:33.833
Northward, you would find the Greying Wildlands, a
lawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:42.490
unconquered by human hands. However, this story
begins in the territory of Western Wynandir,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:50.810
within the boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire.
Emerging 13 generations before, the Dwendalian

00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:55.806
Empire has slowly spread to encompass the
surrounding societies of the region, absorbing the

00:17:55.806 --> 00:18:01.950
peoples of the Zemni Fields and the Marrow Valley,
before finally conquering the Julous Dominion and

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.682
taking the whole of Western Wynandir for the
Empire.

00:18:05.682 --> 00:18:08.104
SAM: There will be no test.

00:18:08.104 --> 00:18:16.764
MATT: No. This is-- let me continue. Under the
rule of the current King Bertrand Dwendal, now in

00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:23.669
his 68th year, most are left to their own devices.
You live as you did before. The crown only takes a

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:31.544
tithe of what you produce and earn. You follow its
laws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:38.925
local leadership. In return, denizens of the
Empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and

00:18:38.925 --> 00:18:45.085
shadowed evils that stalk the edges of the
civilized lands. This accord has led to a

00:18:45.085 --> 00:18:51.369
prosperous century for the Empire, or at least the
political elite. Tensions brew beneath the

00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:57.218
chafing watch of the Crown's Guard. Every temple
is government-owned and run, and worship outside

00:18:57.218 --> 00:19:03.500
the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment.
Rumors of military clashes at the eastern border

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:12.820
near Xhorhas have many common folk on edge. Our
story, however, begins much smaller. Here in the

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.847
southern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the
entry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small

00:19:17.847 --> 00:19:24.087
rural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue
waters of the Ustaloch, this town came to

00:19:24.087 --> 00:19:28.328
prominence near the turn of this recent century,
when the surrounding fertile farmlands were

00:19:28.328 --> 00:19:33.934
discovered to produce a unique type of grain and
wheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the

00:19:33.934 --> 00:19:37.465
glut subsided, three large families stood
triumphant in the local business of fermented

00:19:37.465 --> 00:19:46.859
delights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports
of fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:53.981
stop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering
destinies slowly begin to intersect.

00:19:53.981 --> 00:20:01.657
We begin in the early hours of the morning on the
day of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor

00:20:01.657 --> 00:20:09.837
of the Nestled Nook Inn. A bleary-eyed, bruised
man in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his

00:20:09.837 --> 00:20:15.740
lengthy sleep, catching his small, snoring ally
curled at the foot of the bed. Liam, if you would

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.780
like to describe your character, please.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.597
(nervous laughter)

00:20:21.597 --> 00:20:22.957
LAURA: Oh my god, no pressure!

00:20:22.957 --> 00:20:24.941
SAM: Were we supposed to prepare this?

00:20:24.941 --> 00:20:37.970
LIAM: I'm pretty filthy. I have a mess of
reddish-brown hair, and really filthy road

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:49.408
clothes. I wear a long coat that I slept in. I
slept about 20 hours last night. Jeez. Unshaven, a

00:20:49.408 --> 00:20:51.051
bit of a mess.

00:20:51.051 --> 00:20:53.617
SAM: So far you're just talking about current
Liam.

00:20:53.617 --> 00:20:56.253
LAURA: What color are your eyes? I need visual.

00:20:56.253 --> 00:21:06.707
LIAM: They're blue. That's it. It was a rough day
yesterday, and-- that's it.

00:21:06.707 --> 00:21:08.131
MATT: And your name is?

00:21:08.131 --> 00:21:10.385
LIAM: Oh. Caleb. Caleb Widogast.

00:21:10.385 --> 00:21:15.536
MATT: All right. As your smaller friend curls
awake, Sam, would you like to describe your

00:21:15.536 --> 00:21:17.015
character?

00:21:17.015 --> 00:21:23.385
SAM: Yeah. Um. I am a little goblin girl.

00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:26.426
(laughter)

00:21:26.426 --> 00:21:42.072
SAM: I am a goblin. So, you know, the green skin,
the green hair, the yellow eyes. And she wears

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:48.137
not-great clothes, just like her traveling
companion there. She hides in the shadows a lot,

00:21:48.137 --> 00:21:55.653
because she knows goblins aren't welcome in this
part, and that's about it. I mean, she's a little

00:21:55.653 --> 00:22:00.814
skittish, and right now she's probably stirring
awake as well, right?

00:22:00.814 --> 00:22:02.854
MATT: Well. What's your name?

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.811
SAM: Oh. Nott the Brave.

00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:11.388
MATT: So Caleb, as you come to consciousness, you
glance over and can see, slowly snoring and

00:22:11.388 --> 00:22:20.114
rousing at about the same time, Nott's eyes blink
open, her slowly groaning face looking over

00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:21.919
towards you.

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:34.902
SAM: (high-pitched Cockney accent) Oh! You're finally awake, 
I see. Oh yeah, motherfuckers. It's on. You were out for quite

00:22:34.902 --> 00:22:38.151
some time, there. Rough day, eh?

00:22:38.151 --> 00:22:40.157
LIAM: (light German accent) Not our best day, no.

00:22:40.157 --> 00:22:46.749
SAM: No, I mean, usually you're so good at
everything, but yesterday you were just-- maybe

00:22:46.749 --> 00:22:48.869
you needed the sleep, is what you needed.

00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:51.393
LIAM: Thank you.

00:22:51.393 --> 00:23:04.846
SAM: Well, don't thank me yet. I should probably
tell you what happened while you were asleep. I

00:23:04.846 --> 00:23:11.307
mean, you were asleep for so long. I got bored,
frankly. I was going through my pack and

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.808
reorganizing.

00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:15.641
LIAM: Has anybody seen you-- &lt;i&gt;seen you&lt;/i&gt; seen you?

00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:24.481
SAM: Well, I mean, many people? I got bored.
You've never slept that long, so I left, I went

00:23:24.481 --> 00:23:30.215
downstairs, I thought I'd do a bit of
window-shopping, and you know how sometimes I get

00:23:30.215 --> 00:23:31.698
the itch, you know?

00:23:31.698 --> 00:23:36.772
LIAM: I do. Did you make it back here okay, at
night?

00:23:36.772 --> 00:23:37.826
SAM: I'm here, aren't I?

00:23:37.826 --> 00:23:38.854
LIAM: Yeah, you are.

00:23:38.854 --> 00:23:46.109
SAM: Yeah, I did. But I might have been spotted by
a few of the Crown's Guard.

00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:47.895
LIAM: Did you have the mask on?

00:23:47.895 --> 00:23:58.355
SAM: No? No, I didn't. But they didn't catch me,
so. Listen, I'm sorry, sometimes I get the urge,

00:23:58.355 --> 00:24:04.145
I've got to take something, you know? I was trying
to replentish what you lost yesterday, and I failed.

00:24:04.145 --> 00:24:10.898
LIAM: Well, we-- (sighs)-- discussed coming to a
bigger town. It's going to be a little more

00:24:10.898 --> 00:24:17.144
difficult now. You can't go-- it was easier on
outskirts, it was easier in farms, but we can't do

00:24:17.144 --> 00:24:18.982
that here.

00:24:18.982 --> 00:24:25.184
SAM: I know, I'm sorry. Yeah. I know. You're
right. Yep. I just got a little bit squiggly.

00:24:25.184 --> 00:24:26.602
That's all.

00:24:26.602 --> 00:24:31.301
LIAM: Okay. Well, I think today you should have
the mask on at all times.

00:24:31.301 --> 00:24:33.193
SAM: Yeah, good idea, Caleb.

00:24:33.193 --> 00:24:42.667
LIAM: It's better when we're working together. If
you need to steal something, do it with my help,

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:44.055
all right?

00:24:44.055 --> 00:24:45.863
SAM: Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.

00:24:45.863 --> 00:24:55.971
LIAM: Back up the conversation a minute. Thank
you. I would not be alive if you had not-- you

00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:58.393
saved my life. So thank you.

00:24:58.393 --> 00:25:00.513
SAM: Ah, no problem.

00:25:00.513 --> 00:25:04.317
LIAM: Yesterday was really not great.

00:25:04.317 --> 00:25:07.628
SAM: Yeah, well, we'll do better today, right?

00:25:07.628 --> 00:25:13.155
LIAM: Sure. Sure we will. Are you hungry?

00:25:13.155 --> 00:25:15.133
SAM: Yeah, I'm starving.

00:25:15.133 --> 00:25:19.047
MATT: At this point, you notice the gentle smell
of cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge

00:25:19.047 --> 00:25:25.268
and eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the
subtle floor of your room, meet your nostrils.

00:25:25.268 --> 00:25:32.038
LIAM: Well, Nott, what are we going to do today? I
can go down and get breakfast and bring it up

00:25:32.038 --> 00:25:38.606
here. At least-- I don't know. I mean, I'm a
little wary of just splashing back into the town

00:25:38.606 --> 00:25:40.102
right away.

00:25:40.102 --> 00:25:44.984
SAM: Let's go down, get some food. I'll come with
you, 'cause as you said, we're better together.

00:25:44.984 --> 00:25:50.169
And we'll take it from there. You need some books
and stuff, right?

00:25:50.169 --> 00:25:52.510
LIAM: Always.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.756
SAM: All right, well, that's on the to-do list.

00:25:55.756 --> 00:25:58.924
LIAM: All right, well, let's get something to eat,
then.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:04.984
MATT: All right, so you prepare yourself with your
mask set over?

00:26:04.984 --> 00:26:13.272
SAM: Yes, yeah, so I have a half a mask that
covers my goblin face, and with the hood over,

00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:18.148
kind of obscures. Maybe it's not a goblin, maybe
it's a little halfling person or something.

00:26:18.148 --> 00:26:24.280
MATT: Which is helpful. The southern, more rural
region of the Empire, especially near Felderwin,

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.749
which is one of the largest tilling and farming
areas of the entire Empire, has a very heavy

00:26:29.749 --> 00:26:37.830
halfling population. And so while this city is not
the core of it, you'd probably see a larger 20-25%

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:42.568
of the population here in Trostenwald is halfling.
So you pass off pretty decently as long as you

00:26:42.568 --> 00:26:49.106
keep away from discerning, intent eyes. So the two
of you manage to gather your things for the time

00:26:49.106 --> 00:26:58.148
being, wander down the stairs from the top floor
down to the base of the tavern, which, the air is

00:26:58.148 --> 00:27:02.110
already bustling with townsfolk and all manner of
travelers preparing to take on the day's

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:07.116
responsibilities. Yorda, the 40-something woman
barkeep with shoulder-length blonde hair and

00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:11.722
weathered skin that you previously rented your
room at the inn from, frantically darts behind the

00:27:11.722 --> 00:27:17.575
bar while the red-headed barmaid rushes from table
to table. It seems that the clientele is a bit

00:27:17.575 --> 00:27:21.700
more than they were expecting this morning. Yorda
yells from behind the bar to the barkeep,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.247
"Adelaine, two more brats and a bit of mush at the
corner table." She looks up, "I'm working on it!"

00:27:27.247 --> 00:27:30.905
And she runs over and heads back to the kitchen.
There's a faint bit of music as two

00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:36.354
slovenly-looking musicians in the corner are
trying to work for tips with a small hat on the

00:27:36.354 --> 00:27:40.376
floor that it looks like nobody's thrown any coin
into it. The tables are fairly busy, except for

00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:44.296
maybe two that appear to be available between the
two of you guys, if you'd like to find a seat.

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:49.082
LIAM: Okay. Sure. Is that easy to do, find a
seat?

00:27:49.082 --> 00:27:51.140
MATT: Yeah, you walk over to it, you sit down.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.560
(laughter)

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.790
LIAM: Is this how D&amp;D works?

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.171
SAM: What do we roll for?

00:27:57.171 --> 00:27:59.660
(laughter)

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:04.424
MATT: You sit down, and due to the chaos that
ensues around you, it takes a little while for

00:28:04.424 --> 00:28:09.981
Adelaine, the red-headed barmaid, to come by, and
she scoots by the table. "I'm terribly sorry. What

00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:11.530
"can I get you?"

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:17.791
SAM: You know, meat if you have it, but if you
don't, that's okay, too. Potatoes, or bacon if

00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:19.731
it's on the menu, but really anything--

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:21.760
MATT: "I can get you all three, it's fine. What
you want?"

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.068
LIAM: A Trost for each of us, please.

00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:29.956
MATT: "For breakfast? I like you. All right, two
Trosts and a bunch of meats. Be right back." And

00:28:29.956 --> 00:28:34.528
she rushes off, she pulls her hair back and ties it as
she goes into the kitchen, getting ready for the

00:28:34.528 --> 00:28:40.154
midst of chaos. While you guys have a moment there
at the table, you can hear conversation muttering

00:28:40.154 --> 00:28:43.707
around you, and you have a brief bit of privacy to
discuss.

00:28:43.707 --> 00:28:48.817
LIAM: Yes, I need books, that's true, but did you
find drink yesterday?

00:28:48.817 --> 00:28:51.377
SAM: I have a little left in my flask.

00:28:51.377 --> 00:28:52.499
LIAM: How much?

00:28:52.499 --> 00:28:54.628
SAM: Just a couple swigs.

00:28:54.628 --> 00:28:58.046
LIAM: So that's also on the to-do list, then.

00:28:58.046 --> 00:29:01.302
SAM: I mean, if you don't want me to get too
jittery, yeah.

00:29:01.302 --> 00:29:04.353
LIAM: All right. Okay. So we'll do that first.

00:29:04.353 --> 00:29:06.013
SAM: All right.

00:29:06.013 --> 00:29:07.938
TRAVIS: I love her.

00:29:07.938 --> 00:29:10.182
(laughter)

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:14.642
MATT: A short time passes before the two platters
are rushed over and scattered across the front of

00:29:14.642 --> 00:29:19.831
your table with a clattering. Pile of meats there
set for you, a little bit placed on the side,

00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:24.946
because you might need, especially with the look
on your face-- Adelaine gives you a glance and

00:29:24.946 --> 00:29:30.067
goes, "Put something in your belly." Comes back
and slides two Trosts to you.

00:29:30.067 --> 00:29:35.092
SAM: I remove my little mask, and then just go
(eating noises).

00:29:35.092 --> 00:29:38.968
(laughter)

00:29:38.968 --> 00:29:43.870
LIAM: I take the last piece.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:53.527
MATT: As you guys are partway through your meal--
let's see, this would be Caleb. You notice out of

00:29:53.527 --> 00:30:00.311
the corner of your eye a gentleman enter the door
looking kind of meek. Middle-age, looks

00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:07.902
work-hardened. He has a heavy chin-beard that is
unkempt and a bit wild, but his eyes are warm.

00:30:07.902 --> 00:30:16.883
He's holding his hat in his grip, and he scans the
room with an eager glance before his face

00:30:16.883 --> 00:30:24.168
brightens, and he begins to push his way across
the room, in your direction, it looks like. He

00:30:24.168 --> 00:30:29.785
scoots over towards your table, and as you're
about to turn and see what he's about--

00:30:29.785 --> 00:30:31.974
LIAM: I'm putting my hand on my purse.

00:30:31.974 --> 00:30:37.226
MATT: --he pivots to the table next to you
instead. He turns to you three.

00:30:37.226 --> 00:30:40.145
(yelps)

00:30:40.145 --> 00:30:43.012
LAURA: We've just been sitting here this whole
time!

00:30:43.012 --> 00:30:55.785
MATT: Yeah. You've met this man the day before,
Rinaldo, the fisherman, who you had aided. And as

00:30:55.785 --> 00:30:58.456
he approaches, he goes, "Might I sit, please?"

00:30:58.456 --> 00:30:59.914
LAURA: Of course, take a seat.

00:30:59.914 --> 00:31:01.331
SAM: What's that?

00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:04.000
MATT: As he sits down in his chair, I would ask
each of you to please describe yourselves,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.532
starting with you, Laura.

00:31:05.532 --> 00:31:11.904
LAURA: (Slavic accent) Oh, well, okay. I'm just, you 
know, a little blue tiefling, that's all, with blue hair.

00:31:11.904 --> 00:31:20.778
And I'm wearing a pretty cute dress, that's all.
And I'm having a good time, you know? We're just

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:22.891
having a good time here at breakfast.

00:31:22.891 --> 00:31:26.102
MATT: All right. And you?

00:31:26.102 --> 00:31:35.309
MARISHA: Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm, you know,
simple girl, simple needs. Just wearing nice, baggy

00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:42.468
clothes, some monk vestiges. They're in nice blues
and greys. You notice I have a blue sash around my

00:31:42.507 --> 00:31:49.587
belt. Got a nice shave going on, little undercut.
Looks like maybe I put on makeup two days ago, and

00:31:49.587 --> 00:31:56.522
I'm like, yeah, it's still holding up. It's fine.
I can work with that.

00:31:56.522 --> 00:31:57.835
SAM: What's your name?

00:31:57.835 --> 00:32:01.969
MATT: We'll get to that. Thank you. And Travis, if
you'd like to describe yourself, please?

00:32:01.969 --> 00:32:05.314
TRAVIS: (Texan drawl) Yeah, I'm here too.

00:32:05.314 --> 00:32:10.976
(laughter)

00:32:10.976 --> 00:32:19.116
TRAVIS: I'm a half-orc, sitting here in beat-up
leathers. Have a big scar across my face.

00:32:19.116 --> 00:32:20.696
SAM: (sings 'Bad to the Bone')

00:32:20.696 --> 00:32:26.708
(laughter)

00:32:26.708 --> 00:32:35.795
TRAVIS: Green skin tone, and got some piecemeal
armor put together and stuff. My name's Fjord.

00:32:35.795 --> 00:32:39.759
LAURA: You're very handsome. I just need to tell
you.

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:41.490
TRAVIS: Thank you. Appreciate that.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:46.028
MATT: As Rinaldo sits down, clutching his hat
still in his hands, says, "I thank you for your

00:32:46.028 --> 00:32:49.899
"time. Fjord. And, I apologize, I forget your
names."

00:32:49.899 --> 00:32:51.564
MARISHA: Beauregard.

00:32:51.564 --> 00:32:53.251
MATT: "Beauregard. And?"

00:32:53.251 --> 00:32:54.254
LAURA: Jester.

00:32:54.254 --> 00:33:02.520
MATT: "Jester, thank you. You all came when no one
else would yesterday, and because of you my

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.525
"daughter is still alive."

00:33:04.525 --> 00:33:11.276
MARISHA: Oh yeah. Sorry for being a pessimistic
asshole, by the way, when we first came into town.

00:33:11.276 --> 00:33:12.832
MATT: "Oh, that's okay."

00:33:12.832 --> 00:33:15.694
MARISHA: I'm not used to things turning out good.

00:33:15.694 --> 00:33:25.381
MATT: "You'll do well this side of the Empire.
Anyway. I won't keep you, but I-- we spoke

00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:31.233
"yesterday, and I didn't have much to give you.
Sent you away with nothing but my gratitude. But

00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:37.680
"I've been asking around the other fishermen,
lochsmen, and we've put together a little bit of

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.569
"coin for your troubles, so." And he turns his cap
over on the table, and this catches your

00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:47.749
attention, you hear this clattering of coin. Your
eyes glance over, especially you, Nott, and watch

00:33:47.749 --> 00:33:51.785
as he leaves this pile of what looks to be mostly
copper and silver pieces, with a couple of

00:33:51.785 --> 00:33:56.489
glimmers of gold, and as soon as it clatters
across the hard wood table here in the center of

00:33:56.489 --> 00:34:01.796
the tavern, other faces begin to turn, gather
attention as to what's happening over here in the

00:34:01.796 --> 00:34:08.196
back edge, and he takes his cap back and pushes it
forward towards all of you, his dirty, you can see

00:34:08.196 --> 00:34:14.442
cracked and very callused fingers shoving it in
your direction, before taking his hat and placing

00:34:14.442 --> 00:34:16.257
it back over his head.

00:34:16.257 --> 00:34:17.406
LAURA: So cool!

00:34:17.406 --> 00:34:19.225
LIAM: Those coins went all over the floor?

00:34:19.225 --> 00:34:26.677
MATT: All over the table. "I hope it's helpful.
But thank you."

00:34:26.677 --> 00:34:29.266
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Oh wait.

00:34:29.266 --> 00:34:31.360
TRAVIS: We can't accept this, right? I mean, it's
too much.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.836
MARISHA: We're supposed to at least say that,
right? And then still accept it, right?

00:34:35.836 --> 00:34:37.757
TRAVIS: I think you're supposed to do it if you
say it.

00:34:37.757 --> 00:34:42.467
LAURA: Well, I mean, he did go around to a bunch
of people. That was a lot of work on his part. I

00:34:42.467 --> 00:34:46.280
would hate to make him go back to all of those
people and give it back to each individual

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.137
person.

00:34:47.137 --> 00:34:48.177
TRAVIS: Fine, fine.

00:34:48.177 --> 00:34:51.625
MARISHA: If he didn't keep a ledger, you know. We
wouldn't want to do that. It's rude not to accept

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:54.033
a gift, right? It's rude not to accept a gift,
right?

00:34:54.033 --> 00:35:02.394
MATT: "I would hope that is the case. Anyway.
Thank you very much. I am sorry for getting in

00:35:02.394 --> 00:35:07.261
"your way." And he stands up and gives you all a
nod and rushes out of the tavern, a little

00:35:07.261 --> 00:35:10.093
embarrassed by all the attention that's now placed
on him by the other patrons, and as he leaves,

00:35:10.093 --> 00:35:14.449
everyone goes back to their business, a couple of
wandering eyes starting to count what coins are

00:35:14.449 --> 00:35:17.055
there as you slowly mitt them in your direction.

00:35:17.055 --> 00:35:18.873
LAURA: Divide it up.

00:35:18.873 --> 00:35:20.186
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

00:35:20.186 --> 00:35:28.898
MATT: There are four gold pieces amongst the pile,
22 silver, and 48 copper pieces.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.944
TRAVIS: Can I clock the room, see who else is
watching her count?

00:35:32.944 --> 00:35:35.195
MATT: Perception check. 48 copper.

00:35:35.195 --> 00:35:36.612
TRAVIS: Is this the first roll?

00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:40.370
MATT: First roll of the campaign.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.279
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:46.403
(cheering)

00:35:46.403 --> 00:35:52.034
MATT: And that's how you start it. All right.

00:35:52.034 --> 00:35:57.441
LAURA: So I'm leaving it to you to do that
counting. Which is really hard for me, personally,

00:35:57.441 --> 00:35:59.146
but there you go.

00:35:59.146 --> 00:36:03.096
MARISHA: How do you split up four gold? We have
four gold and there's only three of us.

00:36:03.096 --> 00:36:04.668
LAURA: Don't know.

00:36:04.668 --> 00:36:07.401
TRAVIS: Well, I actually did pretty good at that
card game, so you can have mine.

00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:11.003
MARISHA: Aw. I will. Okay.

00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:13.252
LAURA: So two for each of us! That's great.

00:36:13.252 --> 00:36:18.266
MARISHA: Oh, that's good. One for you, two for
me, two for-- oh wait, no, wait, math doesn't

00:36:18.266 --> 00:36:20.060
make sense.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.692
SAM: She's your treasurer?

00:36:21.692 --> 00:36:23.751
MATT: This is going to go great.

00:36:23.751 --> 00:36:27.447
LAURA: It's hard not being the treasurer.

00:36:27.447 --> 00:36:37.134
MARISHA: I'll give two to Jester, one for you, one
for me. And then 22 silver, that's--

00:36:37.134 --> 00:36:40.488
LAURA: Tell you what, you do that math.

00:36:40.488 --> 00:36:47.430
MATT: While you're counting this out and figuring
out the division of your gains, Fjord, you glance

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:55.767
about, narrowing your orcish eyes across the room,
and you can see two other tables there are some

00:36:55.767 --> 00:37:00.150
gentlemen who are peering over, and as soon as
they meet your gaze, they go right back to their

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:08.950
business and completely shrink away. There's a man
and a hooded figure at a table immediately

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:14.934
adjacent to you. The man looks rather filthy, his
hair a bit unkempt, and he's trying to finish his

00:37:14.934 --> 00:37:20.692
drink. However, the smaller halfling-looking
figure is just glaring intently, and is slowly

00:37:20.692 --> 00:37:22.990
leaning in the direction of the table.

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:29.244
TRAVIS: That's creepy. Fucking disgusting. I think
we have people watching us.

00:37:29.244 --> 00:37:31.182
LAURA: Who is watching us?

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:33.724
TRAVIS: Well, just take a look right over there.

00:37:33.724 --> 00:37:38.446
SAM: Don't arouse suspicion, but did you hear all
that coin hit that table, Caleb?

00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:42.992
LIAM: I did. It's on the table, though, so I think
on the table it will stay.

00:37:42.992 --> 00:37:49.655
SAM: Yes, but we could follow them out. We could
do the Moneypot. We could run Rat Food. We could

00:37:49.655 --> 00:37:55.501
do Prince and the Pauper to get it from them. We
could try Spider Eyes. Any of those could work--

00:37:55.501 --> 00:37:57.942
LAURA: Are you guys staying here?

00:37:57.942 --> 00:38:02.480
MATT: This blue-skinned tiefling suddenly leans
over to you at the table.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:08.328
SAM: Don't move. Don't move. Tieflings can only
see movement.

00:38:08.328 --> 00:38:11.791
LIAM: I don't think that's true--

00:38:11.791 --> 00:38:15.747
LAURA: It's very true, we have a hard time seeing
things that aren't moving, it's very true. But I

00:38:15.747 --> 00:38:21.401
can hear you. You should take a bath. You know they
have showers here. It's possible.

00:38:21.401 --> 00:38:22.953
LIAM: A what now?

00:38:22.953 --> 00:38:24.932
LAURA: You bathe yourself in water.

00:38:24.932 --> 00:38:28.252
LIAM: No, I've bathed before, yeah, I know what a
bath is.

00:38:28.252 --> 00:38:32.857
LAURA: It's because you smell really bad, and it's
wafting over this direction. I'm just letting you

00:38:32.857 --> 00:38:36.343
know. I would hate if I smelled that bad and
someone didn't tell me.

00:38:36.343 --> 00:38:38.880
LIAM: I've only just met you.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.161
LAURA: Hi! I'm Jester.

00:38:41.161 --> 00:38:44.892
LIAM: Hi, I'm Caleb.

00:38:44.892 --> 00:38:50.855
LAURA: Nice to meet you, Caleb. How much silver
did I just get?

00:38:50.855 --> 00:38:51.943
MARISHA: Seven!

00:38:51.943 --> 00:38:52.898
LAURA: Woo!

00:38:52.898 --> 00:38:56.144
(laughter)

00:38:56.144 --> 00:38:59.822
MARISHA: And 16 copper. Aren't you all jealous?

00:38:59.822 --> 00:39:04.315
SAM: Morning.

00:39:04.315 --> 00:39:06.016
MARISHA: Morning.

00:39:06.016 --> 00:39:11.506
MATT: Make a perception check, Beauregard and
Jester.

00:39:11.506 --> 00:39:14.985
LAURA: Whoa.

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:18.857
LIAM: Are you checking your DnD Beyond specs?

00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:20.564
MARISHA: I am, I'm adding my--

00:39:20.564 --> 00:39:29.708
LAURA: 22. I haven't even flipped over my
character sheet yet. This is crazy.

00:39:29.708 --> 00:39:31.363
MARISHA: 19.

00:39:31.363 --> 00:39:39.071
MATT: Okay. The somewhat meek female halfling
who's now suddenly very reserved, and not as

00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:46.733
filthy as the human compatriot that she keeps,
seems less and less halfling the more you glance

00:39:46.733 --> 00:39:53.423
in her direction. The ears are folded inward but
elongated, the tinges of green to the skin, and

00:39:53.423 --> 00:39:58.106
with the little words that have poked through her
lips, you can see what appear to be teeth more jagged

00:39:58.106 --> 00:40:01.271
than expected of the half-folk.

00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:06.073
MARISHA: I just shout over and I say, good
morning, in Halfling.

00:40:06.073 --> 00:40:16.345
SAM: I know Halfling, right? Yes. I'll shout back,
top of the morning to you.

00:40:16.345 --> 00:40:21.880
(laughter)

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.104
MARISHA: Would you like a coffee? I'd love to buy
you a coffee.

00:40:25.104 --> 00:40:33.291
SAM: We've got-- free coffee? Yeah, yeah, I'll
take it. Sure. Thank you.

00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:37.639
TRAVIS: You're being mighty fucking friendly. They
were looking at our coin.

00:40:37.639 --> 00:40:42.498
MARISHA: Why can't they have been looking at me?
Maybe they were looking at me.

00:40:42.498 --> 00:40:44.160
TRAVIS: I didn't think of that.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.517
MARISHA: Maybe they were looking at you. As Jester
said, you're handsome.

00:40:49.517 --> 00:40:51.475
LIAM: Just--

00:40:51.475 --> 00:40:52.901
LAURA: Yes?

00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:55.044
LIAM: Nott.

00:40:55.044 --> 00:40:57.492
SAM: He said "Jest".

00:40:57.492 --> 00:40:59.689
LAURA: I just thought you said my name, is all.

00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:03.956
MARISHA: Oh, I said your name. Oh, they might have
said your name, too.

00:41:03.956 --> 00:41:07.999
LIAM: Never mind, never mind. Could I get another
Trost over here, please?

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:09.752
SAM: Two, please, right away.

00:41:09.752 --> 00:41:17.761
MATT: Eventually Adelaine comes by and brings two
fresh Trosts to the table, glancing about at the

00:41:17.761 --> 00:41:24.702
unique tension in the air right here. "Would you
like anything as well?"

00:41:24.702 --> 00:41:28.759
LAURA: Oh, yes. Lots of baked goods if you have
them, please.

00:41:28.759 --> 00:41:30.602
TRAVIS: Pork belly, if you have it.

00:41:30.602 --> 00:41:33.168
MARISHA: I don't think I've seen you eat anything
other than pastries.

00:41:33.168 --> 00:41:34.891
LAURA: I really like them.

00:41:34.891 --> 00:41:40.162
MARISHA: I'm kind of concerned for your
well-being. It's fine, I'm not that concerned.

00:41:40.162 --> 00:41:44.490
Eat whatever you want. I'll have bacon, some
ham, whatever.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:50.778
MATT: "All right, pork it is. I'll be right back."
She rushes off to the kitchen. You guys continue

00:41:50.778 --> 00:41:52.515
to awkwardly stare at each other.

00:41:52.515 --> 00:42:00.083
LIAM: I'm going to put my hand up and say,
quietly, to Nott, the Moneypot is not for them.

00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:04.440
It's not for them, it's for farmers. Okay?

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.405
SAM: Yeah, you're right, you're right.

00:42:06.405 --> 00:42:09.066
MARISHA: Do we notice them whispering?

00:42:09.066 --> 00:42:10.537
MATT: With your perception rolls earlier? Yes.

00:42:10.537 --> 00:42:13.544
LIAM: But I said it really quietly.

00:42:13.544 --> 00:42:16.073
(laughter)

00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:17.211
MATT: She rolled a 22.

00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:18.899
LIAM: But she can hear my little whisper?

00:42:18.899 --> 00:42:23.783
MATT: No, you heard the whisper, you're not sure
what the words are. You can see that they're

00:42:23.783 --> 00:42:26.423
whispering. Being mysterious.

00:42:26.423 --> 00:42:29.303
LAURA: Okay, cool.

00:42:29.303 --> 00:42:36.697
SAM: In Halfling, I'll say to Beau--

00:42:36.697 --> 00:42:39.306
MARISHA: Beau for short works.

00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:48.498
SAM: Are you in town for business or pleasure?

00:42:48.889 --> 00:42:52.065
MARISHA: Can I insight check him, see what he's
hiding?

00:42:52.065 --> 00:42:53.447
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:42:53.447 --> 00:42:55.738
MARISHA: Okay. What's my insight, I can't
remember.

00:42:55.738 --> 00:43:00.573
LAURA: What is he saying? I mean you, you're a
girl. What is she saying? Shit. That's really hard

00:43:00.573 --> 00:43:01.965
to remember now.

00:43:01.965 --> 00:43:03.390
SAM: You're asking me what I'm saying.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:04.604
LAURA: Yeah, what did you just say?

00:43:04.604 --> 00:43:05.721
MARISHA: 13.

00:43:05.721 --> 00:43:13.586
MATT: 13? I mean, seems to be genuine. Hard to
read through all the wrappings, shadow, and the

00:43:13.586 --> 00:43:15.442
hood still obscuring the face.

00:43:15.442 --> 00:43:18.457
LAURA: Do you have the mask covering you?

00:43:18.457 --> 00:43:20.345
SAM: I think I do.

00:43:20.345 --> 00:43:28.741
MATT: Yeah, it's this porcelain covering that has
painted lips. It's a little unsettling.

00:43:28.741 --> 00:43:35.765
LIAM: I mean, I'm sorry, not to be blunt, but, you
know. It's pretty obvious goblins are not welcome

00:43:35.824 --> 00:43:37.474
strolling about.

00:43:37.474 --> 00:43:39.123
LAURA: She's a goblin?!

00:43:39.123 --> 00:43:44.513
SAM: Yeah, yeah, but you don't have to make a big
thing of it, all right? There could be people here

00:43:44.513 --> 00:43:45.839
who don't know.

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:49.968
LIAM: That's right. She's my companion, she's my
friend. There's nothing to make a big deal about.

00:43:49.968 --> 00:43:54.308
That's why she's wrapped up. Just leave it,
please.

00:43:54.308 --> 00:43:56.146
LAURA: I didn't ask why she was wrapped up.

00:43:56.146 --> 00:43:59.220
MARISHA: I know, we're not making a big deal out
it. You're making a big deal out of it.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.814
LIAM: Somebody asked why she was wrapped up.

00:44:00.814 --> 00:44:01.814
LAURA: No, nobody asked.

00:44:01.814 --> 00:44:04.466
LIAM: Somebody said the words-- this is Liam--
"Why are you all wrapped up?"

00:44:04.466 --> 00:44:08.105
MARISHA: Oh, I asked if she was cold.

00:44:08.105 --> 00:44:11.526
(laughter)

00:44:11.526 --> 00:44:12.902
SAM: That's concern.

00:44:12.902 --> 00:44:14.398
MATT: As Caleb finishes oversharing.

00:44:14.398 --> 00:44:17.379
LIAM: Vaxleth is over. It's so over!

00:44:17.379 --> 00:44:20.952
MARISHA: Those are old times, man. That was a
different universe. Different life.

00:44:20.952 --> 00:44:32.934
MATT: At this point, there is a bit of a commotion
towards the entrance of the tavern. Two shadows

00:44:32.934 --> 00:44:39.786
step into the doorway of the nearish-noonday sun.
The figures, one eclipsing the other from behind,

00:44:39.786 --> 00:44:46.226
begin to step in. You notice one of them begins to
step from table to table, glancing about with a

00:44:46.226 --> 00:44:51.962
sort of grace to the movement, the other staying a
few feet behind. Taliesin, if you'd like to

00:44:51.962 --> 00:44:53.505
describe your character, please.

00:44:53.505 --> 00:44:55.062
LAURA: I didn't think we were going to meet you so
soon!

00:44:55.062 --> 00:44:57.204
TALIESIN: Neither did I.

00:44:57.204 --> 00:44:58.474
ASHLEY: I didn't either.

00:44:58.474 --> 00:45:10.431
TALIESIN: But here we are. A lavender-- damn it,
Travis. A lavender tiefling with red eyes and very

00:45:10.431 --> 00:45:17.223
pierced, extremely ostentatious horns that are
pierced with little gems and little baubles. He's

00:45:17.223 --> 00:45:22.960
got a tattoo that seems to be running up the side
of his face, a peacock tattoo that goes off into

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:35.775
his very ostentatious, ridiculous, overblown robes
that he wears. His two swords and pouch dangling at

00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:42.785
the side of his hips. He's very broad in his
dress.

00:45:42.785 --> 00:45:44.924
LIAM: So a literal and figurative peacock.

00:45:44.924 --> 00:45:46.276
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.853
TRAVIS: One of your characters? No.

00:45:47.853 --> 00:45:49.483
TALIESIN: I know, mine. Who knew?

00:45:49.483 --> 00:45:54.312
MATT: As this tiefling darts from table to table,
a few feet behind, you see--

00:45:54.312 --> 00:45:56.890
ASHLEY: Wait, did you say your name?

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.086
TALIESIN: I didn't say my name.

00:45:58.086 --> 00:46:09.153
ASHLEY: Okay. So there is a woman behind him. Taller
than your average... lass.

00:46:09.153 --> 00:46:12.700
(laughter)

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:25.126
ASHLEY: She's very, very, very pale-skinned. Her
hair is black that starts to turn white as it gets

00:46:25.126 --> 00:46:34.962
longer. It's matted, it's dreaded, it's braided.
Her clothes are a bit tattered, but just sort of--

00:46:34.962 --> 00:46:47.753
she's a bit of a mess, and she has two different
color eyes. One of them is a light greenish-blue,

00:46:47.753 --> 00:46:58.819
and the other is a violet color. And she's very
standoffish, hunch-y, arms folded.

00:46:58.819 --> 00:47:06.236
MATT: You watch as these figures slowly move from
table to table, the tiefling engaging in some

00:47:06.236 --> 00:47:12.943
distant conversation, leaving a slip of paper,
walking to the next table. Gauging the atmosphere,

00:47:12.943 --> 00:47:18.610
not leaving a slip of paper, and quickly moving
on, and then eventually your eyes meet what looks

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:24.084
to be two tables with a very motley crew of
individuals that are both awkwardly avoiding their

00:47:24.084 --> 00:47:26.795
own tension and currently trying to figure you
out.

00:47:26.795 --> 00:47:33.063
TALIESIN: Can I tell if-- where are they in the
dispensement of the coin? Can I tell they have a

00:47:33.063 --> 00:47:35.326
little coin on them? Did I catch any of that?

00:47:35.326 --> 00:47:39.124
MATT: They've completed distributing, so you don't
see any coin, unfortunately.

00:47:39.124 --> 00:47:47.245
TALIESIN: Well. I don't believe I've ever seen a
group of people more in need of a good time in my

00:47:47.245 --> 00:47:55.442
entire life. Mollymauk Tealeaf of the Fletching
and Moondrop Traveling Carnival of Curiosities. If

00:47:55.442 --> 00:48:01.639
there was ever a group of people that needed a
good time to go out, have a laugh, see things that

00:48:01.639 --> 00:48:07.055
you have never seen before, and my god, take my
word for it, one month's time, people will be

00:48:07.055 --> 00:48:12.848
buying your ale to hear the tale of what you saw
at the Traveling Carnival of Curiosities this night.

00:48:12.848 --> 00:48:15.916
LAURA: We saw your tent going up! We did!

00:48:15.916 --> 00:48:20.801
MARISHA: We were actually going to go without the
flyer, but now we also have a flyer.

00:48:20.801 --> 00:48:25.863
TALIESIN: It's just five copper. A steal. At five
silver, it would be a steal, at five gold? Worth

00:48:25.863 --> 00:48:32.563
every penny. But if you've got the five copper to
spend, we would happily have you all.

00:48:32.563 --> 00:48:36.285
LAURA: Do you perform?

00:48:36.285 --> 00:48:43.621
TALIESIN: Ah. I'm less of a performer and more of
an intermediary for these parts. I do on occasion

00:48:43.621 --> 00:48:46.313
perform. I can read fortunes--

00:48:46.313 --> 00:48:49.318
LAURA: (gasps) I was going to ask if you read
fortunes! Can you do one now?

00:48:49.318 --> 00:48:50.847
TALIESIN: I knew you were going to ask that.

00:48:50.847 --> 00:48:54.943
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh, you're so smart. Look
at this guy, he knows everything!

00:48:54.943 --> 00:48:57.348
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down at the table.

00:48:57.348 --> 00:49:01.963
MATT: Okay. He goes and sits down at this table,
finishing his presentation. One of the barmaids

00:49:01.963 --> 00:49:06.253
comes up to you, and looks up. You're standing
almost a solid seven inches taller than her.

00:49:06.253 --> 00:49:09.936
"Miss, can I get you a drink?"

00:49:09.936 --> 00:49:12.403
ASHLEY: (deadpan) Yes could I have a drink,
please. Just some ale.

00:49:12.403 --> 00:49:15.828
MATT: "Coming right up. Any preferences for the
family? Baumbauch?"

00:49:15.828 --> 00:49:17.835
LAURA: Stay clear of Baumbauch. They're dicks.

00:49:17.835 --> 00:49:19.390
MARISHA: That's kind of true.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:20.718
ASHLEY: Just a big.

00:49:20.718 --> 00:49:23.598
MATT: "Husseldorf, then. All right. Be right
back." And she wanders off.

00:49:23.598 --> 00:49:28.970
TALIESIN: Well. Who has coin for a fortune?

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.835
LAURA: Do you know my name?

00:49:30.835 --> 00:49:33.069
TALIESIN: What is your name?

00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:34.152
LAURA: Jester.

00:49:34.152 --> 00:49:35.323
TALIESIN: I know your name now!

00:49:35.323 --> 00:49:37.118
LAURA and TALIESIN: (laugh)

00:49:37.118 --> 00:49:38.410
LAURA: What is your name?

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:41.958
TALIESIN: Oh, my name is Molly to my friends, and
we're friends, now, aren't we? Pleasure.

00:49:41.958 --> 00:49:44.099
LAURA: Molly. Look at this guy.

00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:47.182
TALIESIN: Mollymauk. Molly for short. This is
Yasha, she's a charm.

00:49:47.182 --> 00:49:49.110
ASHLEY: Hello.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:52.679
MARISHA: Yasha. Yasha.

00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:55.294
TALIESIN: Now. Would anyone like a fortune read?

00:49:55.294 --> 00:49:56.479
LAURA: I would love one.

00:49:56.479 --> 00:49:57.780
TALIESIN: Do you have coin?

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.476
LAURA: Yes. How much do you want?

00:49:59.476 --> 00:50:00.573
TALIESIN: Two copper.

00:50:00.573 --> 00:50:02.663
LAURA: Two copper, okay, I just got some copper.
Here you go.

00:50:02.663 --> 00:50:05.502
MATT: Mark down your two copper. (laughs)

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:14.984
TALIESIN: I am taking this in. All right. (sighs)
I'm going to try and do this.

00:50:14.984 --> 00:50:17.402
LAURA: Oh my gosh, really?

00:50:17.402 --> 00:50:27.866
MATT: So, as he pulls out a small set of cards and
begins to shuffle them, go ahead and roll an

00:50:27.866 --> 00:50:29.625
insight check.

00:50:29.625 --> 00:50:34.082
ASHLEY: (deadpan) He's really quite good, you
all should line up and get your fortunes told.

00:50:34.229 --> 00:50:36.141
(laughter)

00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:38.332
TALIESIN: Let's do a 16 there.

00:50:38.332 --> 00:50:43.773
MATT: Okay, so you get a brief conversation here,
you get a pretty solid read: the excitability, the

00:50:43.773 --> 00:50:49.836
eagerness, and the exuberant interest in just
getting in your face that this person wants-- any

00:50:49.836 --> 00:50:54.235
fortune you tell will probably suffice. Go ahead
and roll a sleight-of-hand check as well.

00:50:54.235 --> 00:50:57.084
SAM: Look at this fucking game!

00:50:57.084 --> 00:50:59.271
(laughter)

00:50:59.271 --> 00:51:00.671
TALIESIN: Also 16.

00:51:00.671 --> 00:51:08.713
MATT: Yeah. And you feel pretty confident that her
eyes are locked onto your eyes at the moment and

00:51:08.713 --> 00:51:13.265
not the deck, as you set up a proper reading. And
the cards are shuffled, set, you place them before

00:51:13.265 --> 00:51:15.016
you, and you may give your fortune.

00:51:15.016 --> 00:51:19.952
SAM: I'm going to just keep my eyes open for any
tricks of the hand, sleight-of-hand-y-type tricks.

00:51:19.952 --> 00:51:21.233
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:51:21.233 --> 00:51:25.519
SAM: Okay. Perception. 14.

00:51:25.519 --> 00:51:28.171
MATT: 14. All right. Everything seems pretty
above-board.

00:51:28.171 --> 00:51:37.027
TALIESIN: Your first card, the Silver Dragon. This
is good. You're pure, you're virtue, you are a

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:41.823
worthwhile and wonderful human being, obviously,
or creature of some repute.

00:51:41.823 --> 00:51:43.886
LAURA: That's what everyone always tells me.

00:51:43.886 --> 00:51:47.790
TALIESIN: It's true. And heading towards the
Anvil.

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.566
LAURA: What is that?

00:51:49.566 --> 00:51:51.109
TALIESIN: That is a destiny forged.

00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:53.150
ASHLEY: (deadpan) Ohh.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:56.504
TALIESIN: There is something bright and
adventurous in your future.

00:51:56.504 --> 00:52:04.061
LAURA: Wow! You know, we did just defeat a really
big snake? So maybe there's even bigger things

00:52:04.061 --> 00:52:05.619
coming up, you know?

00:52:05.619 --> 00:52:07.085
TALIESIN: Can I make another roll?

00:52:07.085 --> 00:52:08.204
MATT: Sure.

00:52:08.204 --> 00:52:10.587
SAM: Ashley confirmed worst hype-man ever.

00:52:10.587 --> 00:52:13.163
(laughter)

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:14.413
TALIESIN: 19.

00:52:14.413 --> 00:52:18.447
MATT: Yeah, easy enough. Even with discerning eyes
at the table, you are at the top of your game.

00:52:18.447 --> 00:52:20.645
TALIESIN: The Serpent card appears. Of course you
did.

00:52:20.645 --> 00:52:24.752
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh! Look at that! How did
you even do that?

00:52:24.752 --> 00:52:27.954
TALIESIN: That's all the cards. I'm simply a
vessel for higher powers.

00:52:27.954 --> 00:52:35.250
LIAM: While everybody's watching this shit happen,
may I cast Detect Magic?

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:43.038
MATT: You may. You lean back and subtly begin a brief
muttering of an incantation, your fingers wash

00:52:43.038 --> 00:52:51.849
through the air, a faint silver gleam across your
fingertips. Nothing magical shows up in the

00:52:51.849 --> 00:52:53.717
immediate vicinity.

00:52:53.717 --> 00:52:57.051
LAURA: Will you ask the cards if I'm going to find
him?

00:52:57.051 --> 00:53:01.126
TALIESIN: If you're going to find her?

00:53:01.126 --> 00:53:02.424
LAURA: Him.

00:53:02.424 --> 00:53:06.408
TALIESIN: Give me a little bit more. Who's this
'him' that you're looking for?

00:53:06.408 --> 00:53:08.360
LAURA: I'm looking for my dad.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.764
TALIESIN: 14.

00:53:09.764 --> 00:53:14.255
MATT: You fumble for a second, but the card still
finds its way through without issue.

00:53:14.255 --> 00:53:25.776
TALIESIN: Pushing through, pushing through. The
Eye card pulls up. You've already found the clue

00:53:25.776 --> 00:53:27.916
you're looking for. You just don't know what it is
yet.

00:53:27.916 --> 00:53:29.398
LAURA: Really?

00:53:29.398 --> 00:53:33.017
TALIESIN: Apparently. Well, it's what the cards
are saying. It's right in front of you.

00:53:33.017 --> 00:53:35.845
LAURA: Wow. Does it say how long ago I found it?
Because that's--

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:38.183
TALIESIN: Sadly, I don't have that sort of
specifics. That's much more expensive.

00:53:38.183 --> 00:53:41.515
LAURA: That's going to take a lot of thinking.

00:53:41.515 --> 00:53:45.824
TALIESIN: Well, you find us at the show, you'll
find my tent and I'd be happy to give you a more

00:53:45.824 --> 00:53:47.023
complicated reading.

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.565
LAURA: I can't wait! It's going to be so much
fun.

00:53:48.565 --> 00:53:49.682
TALIESIN: So much fun.

00:53:49.682 --> 00:53:54.469
MATT: Yasha, at this point, the barmaid, Adelaine,
comes up and hands you the ordered ale.

00:53:54.469 --> 00:53:57.034
ASHLEY: Thank you, my lady.

00:53:57.034 --> 00:53:59.153
MATT: "On the house."

00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:00.706
TALIESIN: On the house!

00:54:00.706 --> 00:54:02.882
ASHLEY: That's very kind of you.

00:54:02.882 --> 00:54:05.192
MARISHA: Do you perform in the circus, too?

00:54:05.192 --> 00:54:10.997
ASHLEY: No. I do not. I just-- I put it up.

00:54:10.997 --> 00:54:13.236
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

00:54:13.236 --> 00:54:15.428
TRAVIS: The tent.

00:54:15.428 --> 00:54:18.597
LAURA: It's a big tent. It would take a lot of
work.

00:54:18.597 --> 00:54:25.523
ASHLEY: I put up the stage, I move things around.
I'm very strong. But I don't do anything in the show.

00:54:25.523 --> 00:54:29.823
TALIESIN: Some of our acts are a little
complicated, with performers who are not of the

00:54:29.823 --> 00:54:34.689
traditional variety. Can make some of the locals
get a little shifty, if you know what I mean, and

00:54:34.689 --> 00:54:38.409
it's good to have a few people around who are
capable of keeping issues contained.

00:54:38.409 --> 00:54:43.109
MARISHA: Is that why it says 'No admittance to the
elderly'? You don't want to deal with those riley

00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:49.278
elderly. Or the ill, yeah. Why no elderly, though?
Ill kind of makes sense, but elderly?

00:54:49.278 --> 00:54:52.882
TALIESIN: We cannot be held responsible for
anything that may happen to someone who is ill or

00:54:52.882 --> 00:54:58.029
infirm. It is such an exciting, impressive show.

00:54:58.029 --> 00:55:03.086
ASHLEY: We've had people die watching it.
Yeah. It's just that exciting. Just from

00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:04.140
excitement.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.044
TRAVIS: Did they die in the show, or from watching
it?

00:55:06.044 --> 00:55:08.926
ASHLEY: Yeah, just like heart attack. Just from
getting so excited, I guess.

00:55:08.926 --> 00:55:12.044
MARISHA: We gotta get so wasted.

00:55:12.044 --> 00:55:15.964
LAURA: When is it? How long is it? When is it?

00:55:15.964 --> 00:55:19.869
MATT: It is actually the day of Grissen, and your
first show is today.

00:55:19.869 --> 00:55:21.411
TALIESIN: First show is tonight.

00:55:21.411 --> 00:55:23.472
LAURA: Well, we have plans tonight!

00:55:23.472 --> 00:55:24.768
MARISHA: Yay!

00:55:24.768 --> 00:55:27.772
LAURA: Do you stinky people want to come with us?

00:55:27.772 --> 00:55:35.300
SAN: I-- Caleb, we don't have any plans tonight. I
guess we could go along. I wouldn't mind seeing it.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.224
MARISHA: It'll be fun!

00:55:37.224 --> 00:55:40.962
TALIESIN: Or you could stay here and buy beer for
the people who do see the shows, and you can hear

00:55:40.962 --> 00:55:42.594
all about it and pay more.

00:55:42.594 --> 00:55:44.339
LIAM: Yeah, we can go.

00:55:44.339 --> 00:55:46.410
LAURA: It's going to be so much fun.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.845
SAM: Yeah, yeah, it sounds like a good night.
Yeah.

00:55:49.845 --> 00:55:53.771
LAURA: Look at all these friends we're making
here. This is a good city.

00:55:53.771 --> 00:55:57.066
SAM: Yeah, it is.

00:55:57.066 --> 00:55:58.498
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:58.498 --> 00:56:05.661
TALIESIN: You are all the most charming people I've
met in-- yes. I finish my beer. (sighs) Well, we'd

00:56:05.661 --> 00:56:06.954
better be getting on.

00:56:06.954 --> 00:56:10.331
ASHLEY: Yep, nice to meet you all. You're so, uh,
wonderful.

00:56:10.331 --> 00:56:14.928
TALIESIN: Charm. Pure charm. See you tonight!

00:56:14.928 --> 00:56:22.477
MATT: And as they leave you, Yasha just downs her
entire ale, slams it on the table, and they both

00:56:22.477 --> 00:56:27.756
walk out, passing a couple more flyers at off
tables, and then exit out to the rest of the day's

00:56:27.756 --> 00:56:29.790
sun beyond your sight.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:32.219
MARISHA: She was awesome.

00:56:32.219 --> 00:56:33.758
TRAVIS: She didn't say much.

00:56:33.758 --> 00:56:35.570
MARISHA: That's why I liked her.

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:40.008
LAURA: She was really, really cool. Did you see
that cool thing she had going on with her chin?

00:56:40.008 --> 00:56:43.091
That's interesting. I wish I would have thought of
something like that.

00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:45.796
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, you could maybe do
something like that in time. Just wait until

00:56:45.796 --> 00:56:46.881
maybe--

00:56:46.881 --> 00:56:48.575
LAURA: So she doesn't know I copied. I can't do it
tonight.

00:56:48.575 --> 00:56:49.845
MARISHA: No, no.

00:56:49.845 --> 00:56:55.785
LAURA: Wow. Cool. What do you guys want to do
now?

00:56:55.785 --> 00:56:57.786
(laughter)

00:56:57.786 --> 00:56:59.151
TRAVIS: Was he using magic?

00:56:59.151 --> 00:57:00.926
LAURA: I don't know.

00:57:00.926 --> 00:57:04.891
MARISHA: Are you-- you're superstitious. Yeah?

00:57:04.891 --> 00:57:06.025
LAURA: No.

00:57:06.025 --> 00:57:07.276
MARISHA: Okay.

00:57:07.276 --> 00:57:09.265
LAURA: No, I'm not superstitious at all.

00:57:09.265 --> 00:57:10.928
MARISHA: You-- sure.

00:57:10.928 --> 00:57:12.183
LAURA: Why?

00:57:12.183 --> 00:57:25.346
MARISHA: I mean, what he was working in was-- he
was doing a little like-- he-- he's a smart guy.

00:57:25.346 --> 00:57:26.551
He's a smart guy.

00:57:26.551 --> 00:57:27.896
LAURA: By the way, did you open your Christmas
present from me?

00:57:27.896 --> 00:57:28.881
TALIESIN: No, not yet, no.

00:57:28.881 --> 00:57:31.706
LAURA: You should go open it! Yes! Go grab the
bag!

00:57:31.706 --> 00:57:34.345
TALIESIN: On the break. On the break, I'll grab
it.

00:57:34.345 --> 00:57:41.768
SAM: Hey, Matt. Dungeon master. They're wearing
what they described. They're not wearing any

00:57:41.768 --> 00:57:44.169
cloaks or anything right now, are they?

00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:48.478
MATT: Both of them have small cloaks over the
shoulders, Beau has a--

00:57:48.478 --> 00:57:49.887
SAM: Do I recognize those cloaks?

00:57:49.887 --> 00:57:52.395
MATT: No, you do not.

00:57:52.395 --> 00:57:55.932
LAURA: What? Why would you recognize the cloaks?

00:57:55.932 --> 00:57:59.992
SAM: Maybe I saw something. I don't know.

00:57:59.992 --> 00:58:02.757
MATT: No, you do not.

00:58:02.757 --> 00:58:04.376
SAM: I didn't see them last night?

00:58:04.376 --> 00:58:05.205
MATT: No.

00:58:05.205 --> 00:58:08.756
SAM: Okay. Interesting.

00:58:08.756 --> 00:58:10.697
MARISHA: Mysteries.

00:58:10.697 --> 00:58:18.691
LIAM: Also, for the record, there was nothing
magic about that. Maybe he's good at reading

00:58:18.691 --> 00:58:22.275
people, but that was not magic.

00:58:22.275 --> 00:58:27.534
SAM: Caleb knows everything about magic. He's been
even teaching me some. He's real good. You should

00:58:27.534 --> 00:58:28.622
see him--

00:58:28.622 --> 00:58:29.762
LIAM: Nott--

00:58:29.762 --> 00:58:31.931
LAURA: Caleb, are you going to go the Academy?

00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:34.798
LIAM: (strained laugh) That's silly.

00:58:34.798 --> 00:58:40.300
SAM: He could if he wanted to. He's really good at
magic. He can make a cat appear and disappear

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.569
whenever he wants.

00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:43.575
LAURA: Really? A cat?

00:58:43.575 --> 00:58:44.744
LIAM: (snaps)

00:58:44.744 --> 00:58:50.104
MATT: You watch as just beneath the table, this
orange patchy tabby leaps up.

00:58:50.104 --> 00:58:54.967
MARISHA: Oh, shit! What's his name?

00:58:54.967 --> 00:58:56.798
LAURA: Or her name!

00:58:56.798 --> 00:59:02.249
LIAM: Well, it is a he. This is my cat Frumpkin.
Frumpkin, yes.

00:59:02.249 --> 00:59:05.043
LAURA: Aw! Can I call him Lumpy?

00:59:05.043 --> 00:59:07.955
LIAM: You can call him Frumpkin.

00:59:07.955 --> 00:59:13.596
LAURA: Look at this Lumpy! Made in England.

00:59:13.596 --> 00:59:16.935
(laughter)

00:59:16.935 --> 00:59:19.784
LIAM: That was a little show gift from Marisha, so
this is Frumpkin.

00:59:19.784 --> 00:59:21.709
LAURA: That's so great.

00:59:21.709 --> 00:59:26.206
SAM: That's not all he can do. Caleb, tell them all
the stuff you can do. It's really impressive!

00:59:26.206 --> 00:59:28.523
LIAM: You know, sometimes less is more.

00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:30.254
LAURA: I can do things, too.

00:59:30.254 --> 00:59:31.622
SAM: With magic?

00:59:31.622 --> 00:59:32.685
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:32.685 --> 00:59:33.860
SAM: Like what?

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.952
LAURA: Like--

00:59:34.952 --> 00:59:36.365
SAM: Not to me, not to me!

00:59:36.365 --> 00:59:44.620
LAURA: Like-- oh, gosh. Okay. I'm going to use
Thaumaturgy and I'm going to make all the windows

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.651
in the place open up really fast, like crash
open.

00:59:47.651 --> 00:59:54.202
MATT: Okay. You watch as four of the nearby
windows slam open with a sudden burst of wind, and

00:59:54.202 --> 00:59:57.934
all the various bits of torchlight that light the
deeper and more shadowed corners of the room

00:59:57.934 --> 01:00:08.853
suddenly darken and flicker. The music suddenly
comes to a stop. Everyone holds their position and

01:00:08.853 --> 01:00:11.102
glances over at the table where you're all sitting.

01:00:11.102 --> 01:00:14.792
TRAVIS: Jester, don't you remember us talking
about keeping a low profile?

01:00:14.849 --> 01:00:18.959
LAURA: You're right. I'm sorry. I use Thaumaturgy
and I close all the windows.

01:00:18.959 --> 01:00:20.961
(laughter)

01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:26.661
MATT: They all slam shut a second time. The light
flickers and then brightens back to its normal place.

01:00:26.661 --> 01:00:28.823
LAURA: Ta-da!

01:00:28.823 --> 01:00:33.847
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah!

01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:37.672
LAURA: Come see me tonight at the carnival! I'm
really good!

01:00:37.672 --> 01:00:45.377
MATT: One really crotchety-looking guy in his
early 50s with a super underbite, probably missing

01:00:45.377 --> 01:00:46.940
most of his teeth, just goes--

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.728
(laughter)

01:00:50.728 --> 01:00:57.210
LIAM: I telepathically tell Frumpkin to jump up
and sit in the lap of the woman in the monk's

01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:01.998
robes who just made a big scene and hopefully keep
her occupied with being cute.

01:01:01.998 --> 01:01:06.171
MATT: Okay. As soon as you sit down, Frumpkin
leaps into your lap and starts purring and rubbing

01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:07.491
up against your hand.

01:01:07.491 --> 01:01:16.503
MARISHA: Hey, buddy. Look at this kitty! I think
he likes me.

01:01:16.503 --> 01:01:18.820
LIAM: Sure, right now he likes you.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.215
MARISHA: Is this a real cat? Or is this a fake
cat?

01:01:21.215 --> 01:01:22.657
LIAM: What do you mean, a fake cat?

01:01:22.657 --> 01:01:24.088
MARISHA: Like a magic cat.

01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:26.195
LIAM: He's both a real cat and a magic cat.

01:01:26.195 --> 01:01:27.823
MARISHA: Is he an illusion cat?

01:01:27.823 --> 01:01:30.795
LIAM: Do you feel him?

01:01:30.795 --> 01:01:33.033
TRAVIS: Could you put him over there?

01:01:33.033 --> 01:01:36.101
MARISHA: Are you allergic to Frumpkins? Oh no!

01:01:36.101 --> 01:01:39.537
LAURA: But he's a magic cat. How can you be
allergic to magic cats?

01:01:39.537 --> 01:01:41.673
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure he's a real fucking cat.

01:01:41.673 --> 01:01:44.241
MARISHA: He's one of those hypoallergenic magic
cats.

01:01:44.241 --> 01:01:46.856
LIAM: I don't know what the Fifth Edition rules
are--

01:01:46.856 --> 01:01:49.093
LAURA: --for cat dander?

01:01:49.093 --> 01:01:53.915
MATT: As far as you know right now? Yeah, he's
having an actual allergic attack. A minor one.

01:01:53.915 --> 01:01:56.366
MARISHA: I walk away a little bit from Fjord.

01:01:56.366 --> 01:01:58.163
LIAM: Shit.

01:01:58.163 --> 01:02:03.979
(laughter)

01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:09.097
SAM: Well, you're both magic-users, then. And so
is the larger fellow?

01:02:09.097 --> 01:02:11.628
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, a little.

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:14.038
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, he's learning. He's getting
really good at it.

01:02:14.038 --> 01:02:15.620
TRAVIS: Trying to learn more.

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.668
LAURA: Yeah, you should have seen him. He
disguised himself the other day, and it was like,

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.937
(clicks tongue).

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:23.478
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester. She's better at it than I
am. We're trying to make our way up to the Academy

01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:26.323
to get a little bit more learning done.

01:02:26.323 --> 01:02:29.017
LAURA: Well, he's going to learn. I'm not going to
go to the Academy.

01:02:29.017 --> 01:02:31.510
MARISHA: Man, this Academy place keeps getting
brought up.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:34.061
TRAVIS: Well yeah, it's the place to be.

01:02:34.061 --> 01:02:35.680
MARISHA: Okay.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.978
SAM: I'm sorry, what Academy are we talking
about?

01:02:39.978 --> 01:02:41.656
TRAVIS: Solstryce Academy. You know.

01:02:41.656 --> 01:02:44.291
MATT: Soltryce.

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:46.093
LAURA: Yeah, that one.

01:02:46.093 --> 01:02:47.761
SAM: The Soul Train Academy.

01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:51.044
LIAM: It's a very fancy place.

01:02:51.044 --> 01:02:52.683
TRAVIS: You know it.

01:02:52.683 --> 01:02:54.415
LIAM: I have heard of it.

01:02:54.415 --> 01:02:58.028
TRAVIS: And you have arcane talents as well.

01:02:58.028 --> 01:02:59.040
LIAM: Yeah.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.010
LAURA: How long have you had yours?

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:14.176
LIAM: That's a tricky question. I studied when I
was younger, and then I gave it up for a while. I

01:03:14.176 --> 01:03:18.367
picked it up again recently. It's all
book-learned.

01:03:18.367 --> 01:03:20.544
LAURA: Wow, that's cool.

01:03:20.544 --> 01:03:23.173
MARISHA: This was a good way to go for your
first.

01:03:23.173 --> 01:03:24.938
LAURA: A frickin' cat!

01:03:24.938 --> 01:03:32.480
MARISHA: This is kind of therapeutic. Making me
feel better, just about life in general.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.431
TRAVIS: (sneezes)

01:03:33.431 --> 01:03:34.814
MARISHA: All right.

01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:42.150
SAM: He reads lots of books, Caleb does. He's very
smart. In fact, should we go looking for more

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.574
right now?

01:03:43.574 --> 01:03:46.468
LIAM: Maybe in a little while.

01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:48.376
LAURA: Can I see one of your books?

01:03:48.376 --> 01:03:57.297
LIAM: Well-- and I pull apart the lapels of my
coat. I have books in what modern-day people like

01:03:57.297 --> 01:03:59.898
to think of as holster-straps, but there's a book
hanging here.

01:03:59.898 --> 01:04:03.191
SAM: I think ancient people would call it a
holster as well.

01:04:03.191 --> 01:04:09.920
LIAM: Bap-bap-bap. The books are right here. I
have these, but these are heirlooms, family

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:19.645
heirlooms, so I don't share those, but-- no, I
like to read. That's all. And I'm a bit of a

01:04:19.645 --> 01:04:30.209
self-starter, so I have to find-- I mean, good
luck at the Academy. That's rough, I hear.

01:04:30.209 --> 01:04:35.143
TRAVIS: Do you know anything about it? We're just
going up. Beginner's luck.

01:04:35.143 --> 01:04:39.435
LAURA: We know it's rich people that go there. We
have to find a way to get you in.

01:04:39.435 --> 01:04:41.982
LIAM: All I know is how hard it is to get into.

01:04:41.982 --> 01:04:44.384
SAM: You don't have a lot of money, then?

01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:45.782
LAURA: Well.

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:46.976
TRAVIS: No.

01:04:46.976 --> 01:04:48.739
LAURA: We had more.

01:04:48.739 --> 01:04:52.140
MARISHA: But then we lost it, but then we got it
back.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.964
TRAVIS: Somebody has a gambling problem.

01:04:53.964 --> 01:04:56.103
SAM: Oh. Which one?

01:04:56.103 --> 01:04:58.406
LAURA: What's the name of it again?

01:04:58.406 --> 01:05:02.330
MATT: It is the Crick-Queen's Call.

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:05.267
LAURA: Have you played it?

01:05:05.267 --> 01:05:06.914
SAM: No, I haven't.

01:05:06.914 --> 01:05:10.357
LAURA: I'll teach you someday. It's so much fun.

01:05:10.357 --> 01:05:11.569
SAM: It's a game?

01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:12.655
LAURA: Yes.

01:05:12.655 --> 01:05:16.799
SAM: Cards? All right. I might like to know that.

01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:20.964
LAURA: I mean, I can teach you, if you want.

01:05:20.964 --> 01:05:22.941
SAM: Yes, I would like to know that.

01:05:22.941 --> 01:05:25.220
LAURA: Okay, I'll deal!

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.308
SAM: Oh, right now?

01:05:26.308 --> 01:05:27.945
LAURA: Yes, sure, this will be fun.

01:05:27.945 --> 01:05:29.104
SAM: Is this okay?

01:05:29.104 --> 01:05:34.966
LIAM: Listen, I would not be sitting here if it
were not for you. Do whatever you like.

01:05:34.966 --> 01:05:39.586
LAURA: Okay. You draw three cards. Well, I give
you three cards. So you use 3d6.

01:05:39.586 --> 01:05:41.077
SAM: 3d6.

01:05:41.077 --> 01:05:42.407
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:42.407 --> 01:05:47.210
SAM: Got one. I'm not you. I have one of each
dice.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:50.139
(laughter)

01:05:50.139 --> 01:05:55.173
LAURA: Okay. So hide your roll from me, because we
can't know. So first you have to ante up. How much

01:05:55.173 --> 01:05:56.965
coin do you want to put in?

01:05:56.965 --> 01:05:58.168
SAM: I'm out.

01:05:58.168 --> 01:06:00.185
(laughter)

01:06:00.185 --> 01:06:05.013
LIAM: It's all right. I will front some coin for
you to play this game.

01:06:05.013 --> 01:06:06.615
LAURA: Oh, great! How much do you want to front
him?

01:06:06.615 --> 01:06:11.129
LIAM: I will give you a silver piece.

01:06:11.129 --> 01:06:13.799
LAURA: A silver. Okay, this is great.

01:06:13.799 --> 01:06:15.480
SAM: Thank you, Caleb. Thank you.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.869
LIAM: Wish I had more.

01:06:16.869 --> 01:06:19.662
LAURA: Okay. Am I doing this right?

01:06:19.662 --> 01:06:20.815
MATT: So far.

01:06:20.815 --> 01:06:30.551
LAURA: Now I'm going to give us three cards, so we
both roll, but we can't see. That's good. Okay.

01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:32.583
MARISHA: Don't say 'that's good'.

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:35.162
LAURA: Bluffing. How do you know I wasn't?

01:06:35.162 --> 01:06:39.097
SAM: I'm going to try to change one of my cards.

01:06:39.097 --> 01:06:42.187
LAURA: No, wait, there's rules!

01:06:42.187 --> 01:06:44.654
SAM: Without you seeing.

01:06:44.654 --> 01:06:46.199
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

01:06:46.199 --> 01:06:50.178
SAM: 12 plus eight, so that's 20.

01:06:50.178 --> 01:06:54.224
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:06:54.224 --> 01:06:59.431
LAURA: No, he totally did it. She totally did it.
This is really hard, Sam.

01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:01.283
LIAM: You're only an hour and a half in.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.099
SAM: This is my only skill, guys.

01:07:03.099 --> 01:07:07.994
LAURA: But, you know, that's my skill, too.

01:07:07.994 --> 01:07:09.230
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.565
LAURA: So I'm going to try to do it as well,
'cause that's my skill as well.

01:07:12.565 --> 01:07:14.714
MATT: Well, first, what'd you roll for--

01:07:14.714 --> 01:07:16.383
LAURA: I did not notice him doing it.

01:07:16.383 --> 01:07:18.386
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you only get to reroll one of
the dice.

01:07:18.386 --> 01:07:21.220
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to try to reroll one of
my three, too.

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:25.060
MATT: Go ahead. So make a sleight-of-hand check.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:29.190
LAURA: Oh, right. Oh, shit.

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:30.398
SAM: Do I notice her?

01:07:30.398 --> 01:07:31.703
MATT: Well, roll a perception check.

01:07:31.703 --> 01:07:32.832
SAM: Nope.

01:07:32.832 --> 01:07:33.846
LAURA: 13?

01:07:33.846 --> 01:07:36.963
SAM: No, I rolled three.

01:07:36.963 --> 01:07:48.544
LAURA: Okay. So the best hand you can get is three
of a kind. Then, after that, it's a straight. A

01:07:48.544 --> 01:07:56.533
high straight. Then a low straight. Then it's if
you get all evens, or if you get all odds, then

01:07:56.533 --> 01:08:02.627
it's two of a kind, then it's nothing, it's just
high card. Okay, but now we put in a second

01:08:02.627 --> 01:08:07.822
amount, because you can up the ante, and you get
one more card.

01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:09.098
SAM: I'm out.

01:08:09.098 --> 01:08:15.215
LAURA: No, but wait, wait, wait. You can put in
more money, and then I deal you a different card.

01:08:15.215 --> 01:08:18.887
You get to give a card back, and then I deal you
another card.

01:08:18.887 --> 01:08:21.056
SAM: Should I? Caleb, do you have any more?

01:08:21.056 --> 01:08:26.378
LIAM: Because you saved my life yesterday, you may
have one more silver piece.

01:08:26.378 --> 01:08:30.660
LAURA: One more silver. Okay, I'll keep it low,
too, because you're only doing the one. So I only

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.427
put in one silver, too.

01:08:32.427 --> 01:08:33.906
MATT: That's a four-silver pot.

01:08:33.906 --> 01:08:38.912
LAURA: Yes. And now give one of your dice back,
whichever one you don't want, and roll it again.

01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:40.877
MATT: So you get to reroll.

01:08:40.877 --> 01:08:41.959
SAM: Okay, got it.

01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:44.142
MATT: And you get to reroll one as well.

01:08:44.142 --> 01:08:49.699
LAURA: I don't want to reroll any. Okay. Now you
show what you got and we'll see who wins.

01:08:49.699 --> 01:08:51.773
SAM: I got a pair of fours.

01:08:51.773 --> 01:08:53.366
LAURA: I got three fives.

01:08:53.366 --> 01:08:57.281
SAM: I draw my shortsword.

01:08:57.281 --> 01:08:59.728
(laughter)

01:08:59.728 --> 01:09:01.932
MARISHA: I immediately grapple him.

01:09:01.932 --> 01:09:08.446
MATT: Make an athletics check. You make an
acrobatics check.

01:09:08.446 --> 01:09:11.817
SAM: Acrobatics? 24.

01:09:11.817 --> 01:09:14.318
MARISHA: 14.

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:21.533
MATT: So the female goblin draws a shortsword. You
reach out to grab, and she slips out of your grasp

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.596
and is now holding the blade at the edge of the
table.

01:09:23.596 --> 01:09:25.479
SAM: You're cheating. Somehow you're cheating.

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:31.364
LIAM: Nott, Nott, that's fine. That's fine. She
won my two silver pieces. We'll just leave it at that.

01:09:31.364 --> 01:09:33.245
SAM: I'm sorry.

01:09:33.245 --> 01:09:38.871
LIAM: That's okay. She's very jumpy sometimes. You
can understand; we've been living in the woods for

01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:43.846
a long time. Every time we come near any place
like this, we're attacked, jumped, followed. So I

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.217
apologize on behalf of--

01:09:45.217 --> 01:09:47.442
SAM: That was stupid. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I'm sorry.

01:09:47.442 --> 01:09:52.781
LAURA: No, it's okay. Just don't do it again. But
I'm sorry I took all this money from your friend.

01:09:52.781 --> 01:09:54.340
LIAM: That's making it worse.

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.505
TRAVIS: Maybe you could give some of it back.

01:09:56.505 --> 01:10:00.070
LAURA: Why, though? But I won it.

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:01.501
SAM: Your Laura is showing.

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:06.800
(laughter)

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:12.906
LAURA: Tell you what. I'll give you-- none of it
back, I can't! Okay, here's one silver back--

01:10:12.906 --> 01:10:14.203
LIAM: No, I insist.

01:10:14.203 --> 01:10:21.532
LAURA: Okay, but I insist, all the money back. All
right, fine, it's mine, thank you. Yay.

01:10:21.532 --> 01:10:23.502
SAM: I need another drink.

01:10:23.502 --> 01:10:27.562
LIAM: A round of Trosts for both our tables,
please.

01:10:27.562 --> 01:10:29.155
LAURA: See? Isn't that the most fun?

01:10:29.155 --> 01:10:30.557
SAM: It's fun.

01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:34.176
MATT: Yorda looks over and goes, "Any preference
of family?"

01:10:34.176 --> 01:10:36.619
LIAM: Not Baumbauch.

01:10:36.619 --> 01:10:38.280
MATT: "Von Brandt it is."

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.726
MARISHA: I'm impressed that you stuck to taking a
guy's money in a training game.

01:10:43.726 --> 01:10:46.517
LAURA: Right? Oh, wait, is that bad?

01:10:46.517 --> 01:10:47.751
MARISHA: Meh.

01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:51.938
LAURA: Well, I only learned last night, you guys.

01:10:51.938 --> 01:10:53.766
LIAM: What is a training game?

01:10:53.766 --> 01:10:56.380
MARISHA: Just meaning when she was teaching.

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.832
LAURA: People took my money when I was learning.

01:10:58.832 --> 01:11:02.652
LIAM: It's fine. It's water under the bridge. It's
fine. It's all right.

01:11:02.652 --> 01:11:08.520
MATT: Another round is brought to your table. You
guys can share a solemn post-game drink amongst

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.900
yourselves.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.944
LIAM: If you feel slightly worse, there's a drink
on me.

01:11:11.944 --> 01:11:15.938
LAURA: Oh jeez, now I'm definitely giving you your
two silver back. Don't worry about it, man.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:19.277
(laughter)

01:11:19.277 --> 01:11:21.710
SAM: She's just a couple of wild and crazy guys
over here.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:25.879
(laughter)

01:11:25.879 --> 01:11:31.194
LAURA: Have my baked goods come out yet?

01:11:31.194 --> 01:11:35.598
MATT: They have. Your meal's been presented for a
while now. You've had the opportunity to eat most

01:11:35.598 --> 01:11:36.745
of your meal.

01:11:36.745 --> 01:11:37.897
SAM: That's real.

01:11:37.897 --> 01:11:41.814
MATT: That is actually real. That's the power of
imagination, Sam. That wasn't there a second ago.

01:11:41.814 --> 01:11:43.152
TALIESIN: Bangarang!

01:11:43.152 --> 01:11:44.900
(laughter)

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.710
TALIESIN: Right there for you.

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:54.441
MATT: So you all finish your independent meals and
decide to continue your conversations or go about

01:11:54.441 --> 01:11:56.217
your business for the day.

01:11:56.217 --> 01:11:58.267
LAURA: I just want to go to the carnival.

01:11:58.267 --> 01:12:00.649
LIAM: That's later tonight, though, isn't it?

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:03.793
MATT: If you have no other business, we can wait
until dusk.

01:12:03.793 --> 01:12:09.231
SAM: Well, there's that board on the wall. Has
anything new been posted on the board?

01:12:09.231 --> 01:12:18.682
MATT: You go ahead and take a look at it. There is
one sheet that pertains to somebody in the Hills

01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:25.542
Ward looking for folks to go ahead and do an
extermination run near the southern portion of the

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:30.614
Ustaloch. It looks like there's what looks to be
a vole infestation.

01:12:30.614 --> 01:12:33.549
TRAVIS: What the fuck is a vole?

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.281
MATT: It's a small rat.

01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:37.536
LAURA: Should we do it?

01:12:37.536 --> 01:12:42.904
MARISHA: I mean, we have to kill Rodents of
Unusual Size.

01:12:42.904 --> 01:12:44.830
SAM: That doesn't sound interesting to me at all.

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:47.463
TRAVIS: What else is there?

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:52.631
MATT: Currently, it looks like there was another
sheet that looks like most has been torn off. The

01:12:52.631 --> 01:12:54.347
rest of the board is pretty empty at the moment.

01:12:54.347 --> 01:12:56.018
LIAM: DM, did I tear that? I can't remember.

01:12:56.018 --> 01:12:57.560
MATT: You did, yes.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:04.163
SAM: Wasn't it a delivery thing?

01:13:04.163 --> 01:13:06.804
LIAM: That was what it was, yeah.

01:13:06.804 --> 01:13:12.742
MATT: It was to help move and load crates at one
of the local breweries.

01:13:12.742 --> 01:13:13.989
SAM: Fuck that.

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:17.484
LAURA: We've done that. It sucked so much.

01:13:17.484 --> 01:13:18.617
SAM: You did that?

01:13:18.617 --> 01:13:20.072
LAURA: Well, by mistake.

01:13:20.072 --> 01:13:22.526
MARISHA: We played D&amp;D and we moved crates for
eight hours.

01:13:22.526 --> 01:13:24.199
(laughter)

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:25.557
TRAVIS: We did, yeah.

01:13:25.557 --> 01:13:26.781
MATT: Welcome to level two.

01:13:26.781 --> 01:13:29.020
SAM: We said no to that job, thank you.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:31.431
TRAVIS: We get bored pretty easily.

01:13:31.431 --> 01:13:38.571
MARISHA: We did, however, then gamble with the
other workers and then Jester-- yeah. Jester--

01:13:38.571 --> 01:13:40.390
LAURA: Well, I lost it, but he made so much.

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:44.227
TRAVIS: Maybe not out loud say that. Just a
thought.

01:13:44.227 --> 01:13:47.040
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. We probably shouldn't.
We didn't make any money.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.232
LAURA: Do you guys want company? Do you want us to
come and hang out with you today?

01:13:50.232 --> 01:13:53.181
SAM: I don't know about that. That sounds risky, I
don't know.

01:13:53.181 --> 01:14:00.787
LIAM: Do you know something? I, shockingly, think
that's not a bad idea.

01:14:00.787 --> 01:14:03.618
SAM: To have these weirdos with us?

01:14:03.618 --> 01:14:05.722
LAURA: I can hear you.

01:14:05.722 --> 01:14:08.970
LIAM: Yesterday was a very bad day.

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:17.320
SAM: Yes. Well, I suppose if we surrounded
ourselves with weirdos, then maybe it would take

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.978
some of heat off of me.

01:14:18.978 --> 01:14:22.472
LIAM: Well, yes. Bottom line: can you hang with
the goblin?

01:14:22.472 --> 01:14:28.721
LAURA: Bottom line-- and I touch Nott's shoulder,
and I cast Blessing of the Trickster.

01:14:28.721 --> 01:14:31.424
SAM: Oh, Jesus, she's going to kill me right now.

01:14:31.424 --> 01:14:32.976
(laughter)

01:14:32.976 --> 01:14:36.463
SAM: Any magic kills a goblin instantly. Yeah,
instantly.

01:14:36.463 --> 01:14:39.568
(laughter)

01:14:39.568 --> 01:14:42.643
LAURA: That would be the worst character choice
ever.

01:14:42.643 --> 01:14:45.294
(laughter)

01:14:45.294 --> 01:14:50.938
LIAM: We will mourn her. Tschuss.

01:14:50.938 --> 01:15:02.607
MATT: Okay, so there's a slight sense of warmth
that emanates from under her hand, and for a

01:15:02.607 --> 01:15:07.931
moment, you look over and glance instinctively,
ready to almost draw your sword again. But it

01:15:07.931 --> 01:15:12.869
seems to quicken your reflexes. You have this
surge of adrenaline that doesn't quite fade.

01:15:12.869 --> 01:15:16.425
LAURA: You have advantage on all your stealth
checks.

01:15:16.425 --> 01:15:17.854
MATT: For the next hour.

01:15:17.854 --> 01:15:21.140
SAM: Thank you. That's very nice.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:27.214
TRAVIS: I don't have a problem with goblins, but
you guys aren't in any trouble, are you? No one's

01:15:27.214 --> 01:15:28.711
after you?

01:15:28.711 --> 01:15:31.571
LAURA: Because she is all kinds of trouble.

01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:33.836
SAM: No one is after me!

01:15:33.836 --> 01:15:36.366
TRAVIS: Can I make an insight check?

01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:37.498
MATT: You may.

01:15:37.498 --> 01:15:41.357
(laughter)

01:15:41.357 --> 01:15:43.762
TRAVIS: 13.

01:15:43.762 --> 01:15:48.817
MATT: 13. If you want to go ahead and try and
lie.

01:15:48.817 --> 01:15:54.936
SAM: That's a 14, except negative three to
performance.

01:15:54.936 --> 01:16:01.099
TALIESIN: I've been waiting for this for so long.

01:16:01.099 --> 01:16:04.274
SAM: So 11.

01:16:04.274 --> 01:16:06.410
MATT: So, are you lying?

01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:11.635
SAM: I am lying. I am definitely on the run from
someone.

01:16:11.635 --> 01:16:14.602
TRAVIS: Good to know.

01:16:14.602 --> 01:16:25.662
MARISHA: So. Mask. I'm just fascinated by the
mask. Looks well-made. Did you make it?

01:16:25.662 --> 01:16:29.229
SAM: That's a good fucking question. Did I make
it?

01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:31.571
(laughter)

01:16:31.571 --> 01:16:33.520
SAM: I don't make things.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.969
MATT: No, I presume-- and we discussed this a
little bit-- we presume it may have been scavenged

01:16:36.969 --> 01:16:38.568
from a porcelain doll.

01:16:38.568 --> 01:16:42.362
SAM: Oh, that's cool. Cool and gross, cool and
gross.

01:16:42.362 --> 01:16:45.789
LAURA: What's her name? The creepy doll?

01:16:45.789 --> 01:16:48.049
TRAVIS: Annabelle.

01:16:48.049 --> 01:16:52.510
(laughter)

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.272
LAURA: No, don't say that. I don't want to see art
with you with Annabelle's face.

01:16:55.272 --> 01:16:56.835
SAM: Too late.

01:16:56.835 --> 01:16:58.398
MATT: The internet's running with that now.

01:16:58.398 --> 01:17:00.109
SAM: Check your Twitter.

01:17:00.109 --> 01:17:03.839
TRAVIS: It seems we have all day. What were your
plans?

01:17:03.839 --> 01:17:12.343
LIAM: Not much. We were going to sample the
different Trosts, and I wanted to maybe do some

01:17:12.343 --> 01:17:14.566
book browsing. Nothing major.

01:17:14.566 --> 01:17:15.896
LAURA: What's a Trost?

01:17:15.896 --> 01:17:17.429
MARISHA: Brewery tour!

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:18.677
SAM: It's ale.

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:21.393
LAURA: We just can't go by the Baumbauch ale.

01:17:21.393 --> 01:17:23.466
SAM: What happened with the Baumbauchs?

01:17:23.466 --> 01:17:25.183
LIAM: There are two others to choose from, here.

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:29.922
MARISHA: They're who we loaded crates for, and
then we kind of swindled their employee.

01:17:29.922 --> 01:17:31.623
TRAVIS: Didn't leave on the best of terms.

01:17:31.623 --> 01:17:37.761
LIAM: DM, which one is the one that everybody
knows has got the blessing of Fryda Langer?

01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:41.777
MATT: No, that is actually the Baumbauch.

01:17:41.777 --> 01:17:42.959
LIAM: Shit.

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:46.724
MATT: Yeah, the Starosta is kind of tied with the
Baumbauch family.

01:17:46.724 --> 01:17:49.004
TALIESIN: We're imaginary beer snobs now.

01:17:49.004 --> 01:17:50.752
LAURA: Is that the one you need?

01:17:50.752 --> 01:17:55.853
LIAM: No, I'm just saying the one that you
swindled, it's got the blessing of the big cheese here.

01:17:55.853 --> 01:18:02.277
LAURA: Oh. Well. Why do you need it?

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:08.891
LIAM: We don't need it. It's just pleasurable to
have a Trost, is what they say. She kind of needs it.

01:18:08.891 --> 01:18:10.752
SAM: I need it a little bit.

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.343
LAURA: You need a beer?

01:18:12.343 --> 01:18:19.406
SAM: Well, I prefer the harder stuff, but I'll
take what I can get at this point. Yeah, I'm

01:18:19.406 --> 01:18:21.986
sticking with this fucking accent for the next two
years.

01:18:21.986 --> 01:18:28.364
(laughter)

01:18:28.364 --> 01:18:30.480
TRAVIS: Laryngitis every Friday.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.189
(laughter)

01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:42.469
MARISHA: So beer tour, then circus?

01:18:42.469 --> 01:18:48.763
LAURA: I've got to say, I miss those two people we
ran into at the carnival.

01:18:48.763 --> 01:18:50.845
TRAVIS: I might just wait for the carnival,
actually.

01:18:50.845 --> 01:18:58.700
MARISHA: Well, if we just montage through a beer
tour, we'll quickly get to the circus. To the

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:04.186
carnival!

01:19:04.186 --> 01:19:06.003
MATT: You can totally do that.

01:19:06.003 --> 01:19:11.257
LIAM: Can we just bring my book-browsing down to a
single roll to see if anything of use--

01:19:11.257 --> 01:19:14.972
MATT: Yeah, we can do that. We'll say, if you guys
decide to go ahead and travel, the five of you,

01:19:14.972 --> 01:19:20.401
you make your way through the town for the day,
you coast around the Husseldorf family brewery,

01:19:20.401 --> 01:19:29.448
you meet Voss and June, who are the two very nice
ladies who run the facility. The Husseldorf

01:19:29.448 --> 01:19:37.698
family. You avoid the Baumbauch, but can acquire
Baumbauch ale from other taverns in the town, of

01:19:37.698 --> 01:19:43.953
course. And the von Brandt family brewery. All of them, as
soon as you say 'Trost', they correct you and say

01:19:43.953 --> 01:19:50.480
the family name. They're very intent on getting
rid of the name 'Trost' as an overall, discussion

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.914
of Trost-brand brews, and trying to make it their
family name. There's an offense, to the point

01:19:54.914 --> 01:19:56.565
where you're like, "Oh, Jesus. I didn't realize."

01:19:56.565 --> 01:19:58.986
TALIESIN: Like Kleenex and tissue paper? All
right.

01:19:58.986 --> 01:20:02.336
MATT: But you manage to get nice and sauced
throughout the day.

01:20:02.336 --> 01:20:09.002
LIAM: I take it easy. I have one more in the first
half of the day, and one in the second half.

01:20:09.002 --> 01:20:09.859
MATT: Okay.

01:20:09.859 --> 01:20:11.064
LAURA: I don't have very much either.

01:20:11.064 --> 01:20:11.986
MATT: Okay.

01:20:11.986 --> 01:20:13.444
SAM: I'm going to have tons.

01:20:13.444 --> 01:20:14.527
MARISHA: I get sauced.

01:20:14.527 --> 01:20:16.082
MATT: All right, well, that being the case--

01:20:16.082 --> 01:20:18.944
LIAM: --you are poisoned.

01:20:18.944 --> 01:20:21.324
MATT: No, make a constitution saving throw.

01:20:21.324 --> 01:20:25.457
SAM: Well, that was crazy. 12.

01:20:25.457 --> 01:20:33.225
MATT: 12, okay. You get a little woozy for a
while, and as the sun begins to crawl towards the

01:20:33.225 --> 01:20:40.154
distant horizon, you do not manage to allow your
meal to usurp your control.

01:20:40.154 --> 01:20:41.962
LAURA: Aw, it's like Ren Faire.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:44.110
MATT: Yeah. Don't remind me.

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:46.351
MARISHA: Good times, good times.

01:20:46.351 --> 01:20:53.823
MATT: So as the day comes to a close, you're
fairly tipsy, you're not fully intoxicated. For

01:20:53.823 --> 01:20:57.958
your trip, you wanted to head to the Hillsbrook
Parchment and Binding.

01:20:57.958 --> 01:21:02.330
LIAM: Is that where I went the last time? Except
not as myself. So I'll go as myself.

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.051
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:09.055
LIAM: All right. Don't fuck me, Vax. That is--

01:21:09.055 --> 01:21:12.434
LAURA: That's Vax. That's Vax's dice.

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:17.220
LIAM: Yeah, the thing about even a light German
accent is that when you say "Vex" and "Vax", it's

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.703
the same shit.

01:21:18.703 --> 01:21:20.803
(laughter)

01:21:20.803 --> 01:21:23.601
LIAM: That is a 12.

01:21:23.601 --> 01:21:30.097
MATT: 12. You take the better part of 30 minutes
or so, and you find there's a lot of books on

01:21:30.097 --> 01:21:37.384
farming techniques. There's a lot of books about
how to grow, care for different types of

01:21:37.384 --> 01:21:45.141
vegetation, plants, various beasts of burden. You
find books on the different seasons and what's

01:21:45.141 --> 01:21:53.151
best for different types of grain and wheats. You
manage to pull through and find a couple of books

01:21:53.151 --> 01:22:00.584
that deal with discussion of the Menagerie Coast
that talk about what's called the Clovis Concord.

01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:05.767
It's more of a discussion of the political
structure that maintains all the city-states there.

01:22:05.767 --> 01:22:10.853
LIAM: And the person who ran this place was an
older man, right? Just sipping tea.

01:22:10.853 --> 01:22:12.411
MATT: Yeah, Sheenah, yeah.

01:22:12.411 --> 01:22:20.366
LIAM: I'm sorry. You have a nice selection here.
Do you mind if I ask-- I haven't seen any other

01:22:20.366 --> 01:22:28.955
booksellers of any kind in town. I'm not really
looking for anything on farming, so much. Is there

01:22:28.955 --> 01:22:32.235
anywhere else I could look into?

01:22:32.235 --> 01:22:40.801
MATT: "If you're looking for some sort of a
library, your best bet is to go to Zadash up north."

01:22:40.801 --> 01:22:42.664
LIAM: Zadash.

01:22:42.664 --> 01:22:48.116
MATT: "That's where the Library of the Cobalt Soul
resides. They have all the information you could

01:22:48.116 --> 01:22:55.485
"hope for. A bit pricey to peruse their interior,
unless you have proper coverage, but unfortunately

01:22:55.485 --> 01:23:01.376
"if what we have isn't what you're looking for, I
can't help you."

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:08.413
LIAM: No, it's a fine selection. Sorry. How much
for this book on hoe technique?

01:23:08.413 --> 01:23:16.299
MATT: "Oh! Jamieson's Hoedown, yes, quite. That
will be two silver pieces."

01:23:16.299 --> 01:23:23.342
LIAM: Oh. I'm very embarrassed, I'm sorry, I gave
away my last two silver pieces.

01:23:23.342 --> 01:23:24.905
LAURA: No, I gave it back to you, remember?

01:23:24.905 --> 01:23:32.729
LIAM: I gave away my last two silver pieces, so.
Maybe I can earn it back and come back later this week.

01:23:32.729 --> 01:23:35.196
MATT: "Please do. Do you want me to hold it for
you?"

01:23:35.196 --> 01:23:36.456
LIAM: Yes.

01:23:36.456 --> 01:23:38.128
MATT: "What's your name?"

01:23:38.128 --> 01:23:41.187
LIAM: My name is Caleb Widogast.

01:23:41.187 --> 01:23:46.231
MATT: "All right. I will keep it here under the
shelf. Thank you so much."

01:23:46.231 --> 01:23:48.343
LIAM: Okay, good day, thank you.

01:23:48.343 --> 01:23:49.882
LAURA: Is this a big shop?

01:23:49.882 --> 01:23:55.584
MATT: It's a boutique. It's designed almost like a
cross. There's two cross-sections of hallways that

01:23:55.584 --> 01:24:00.014
have books across the walls, and there's a window
at the end of each and then a door at the far back.

01:24:00.014 --> 01:24:06.036
LAURA: While he was talking to the shopkeeper, I'm
going to take out as many books as I can and move

01:24:06.036 --> 01:24:10.818
them around on the shelves, and then take some of
them and turn them around to where their binding

01:24:10.818 --> 01:24:12.467
is facing the inside.

01:24:12.467 --> 01:24:14.768
MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check.

01:24:14.768 --> 01:24:18.308
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:23.169
MATT: Over the period of him searching and
distracting this man, you have completely

01:24:23.169 --> 01:24:31.503
rearranged the interior of this bookstore, to the
point where even in the far corner, you

01:24:31.503 --> 01:24:35.508
Ghostbusters stack them in the center of the room,
floor-to-ceiling, with him not even noticing it.

01:24:35.508 --> 01:24:38.301
LIAM: You little fucking poltergeist.

01:24:38.301 --> 01:24:45.281
MATT: You feel confident and happy and a sensation
of approval washes over you. All right, so.

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:47.160
LAURA: I skip out the door.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.692
MATT: Okay. You turn around from having this
conversation and notice the interior is not as you

01:24:51.692 --> 01:24:56.174
last saw it, and a bit of nerves begin to brew up
under you.

01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:58.500
LIAM: Frumpkin, come on.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.518
MATT: (meows) Frumpkin follows behind.

01:25:00.518 --> 01:25:04.323
LIAM: Oh yes! Matt's got to make cat sounds now!

01:25:04.323 --> 01:25:09.307
MATT: I didn't even think about that until now.
God damn it. All right, so as you guys have

01:25:09.307 --> 01:25:16.893
gathered at this point, the oranges and the pinks
of dusk begin to peek through the quite-cloudy

01:25:16.893 --> 01:25:22.762
sky, the chilled air of the coming night sky
signalling the Crown's Guard to begin lighting the

01:25:22.829 --> 01:25:27.282
hanging lanterns that line the streets of
Trostenwald. A renewed energy takes the streets as

01:25:27.282 --> 01:25:34.694
the sound of a fiddle seems to creep through the
night air.

01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:36.615
SAM: My god, Ashley's a master fiddler, isn't
she?

01:25:36.615 --> 01:25:37.698
ASHLEY: Beedle-deedle.

01:25:37.698 --> 01:25:40.215
(laughter)

01:25:40.215 --> 01:25:44.060
TRAVIS: I love how your fiddle noises were
"beedle-deedle".

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:48.975
ASHLEY: That's the sound for all instruments,
right?

01:25:48.975 --> 01:25:51.998
SAM: Drums.

01:25:51.998 --> 01:25:59.392
LIAM: By the way, DM, can I ask-- sometime in the
entire day, when Nott was getting wasted, could I

01:25:59.392 --> 01:26:04.045
have spent an hour using Arcane Recovery to gain
back that one spell slot I used this morning?

01:26:04.045 --> 01:26:12.231
MATT: Sure, yeah. I'll allow that. All right.
Folks begin to prod their heads out into the open

01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:17.605
air, curious about the source of this unusual din,
and you find your vision capturing a small

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:23.626
procession of flamboyantly dressed people parading
through the central road. A lanky man of some

01:26:23.626 --> 01:26:29.823
obvious elven descent leads the pack, his long,
ashy-brown hair curling ever-so-slightly past his

01:26:29.823 --> 01:26:36.851
mid-back, his long coat and tails knocking around
by his skipping step. Two halfling women in purple

01:26:36.851 --> 01:26:43.022
and green bodysuits dance from side to side,
handing flowers to children and flyers to adults,

01:26:43.022 --> 01:26:50.049
as a bald man in a neck-frilled frock coat of
bright red, his face adorned in vibrant orange

01:26:50.049 --> 01:26:55.629
makeup to look like the setting sun behind him,
plays the violin that you heard earlier in an

01:26:55.629 --> 01:27:03.193
upbeat, jovial manner. A tall half-orc masculine
man with a well-groomed handlebar mustache that

01:27:03.193 --> 01:27:08.448
curves out to the side, billowing white silk shirt
and black trousers, follows behind with a big drum

01:27:08.448 --> 01:27:16.098
slung over his shoulder, going (drumming) along with the
fiddle. The tiefling man of lavender skin that you

01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:23.518
saw earlier walks along with a grin, juggling two
curved scimitars as he walks in place, almost

01:27:23.518 --> 01:27:28.097
loses one and catches it, continues to go.
Families are beginning to gather out to see this

01:27:28.097 --> 01:27:37.261
display. The two dancers part, and then a woman of
short, fiery red hair and dark skin walking

01:27:37.261 --> 01:27:42.838
between them, lifting a small candle before--
fwoosh! A giant burst, a gout of flame emerges

01:27:42.838 --> 01:27:46.764
from the front of her mouth, brightens the
vicinity, and everyone collectively gasps and

01:27:46.764 --> 01:27:54.289
begins cheering and clapping as they continue the
walk. There, to the back of it, you see the rather

01:27:54.289 --> 01:28:00.490
burly-looking pale woman, arms crossed, just
following behind and keeping an eye like a

01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:06.675
security guard to ensure that no business gets out
of hand. The gasps and the cheers begin to follow,

01:28:06.675 --> 01:28:11.377
and as the procession continues down its way, the
families and civilians begin to gather and follow

01:28:11.377 --> 01:28:19.173
behind. As the last bit of the sun sets behind the
mountain range, the torches glowing, the

01:28:19.173 --> 01:28:24.697
procession curves through the center of the Loch
Ward to the edge of the Ustaloch itself. Through

01:28:24.697 --> 01:28:28.297
the fishing village, more folks begin to gather.
Do you all follow?

01:28:28.297 --> 01:28:30.456
ALL: Yeah.

01:28:30.456 --> 01:28:33.741
LAURA: And I cast Blessing of the Trickster on you
again, just in case.

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.284
SAM: Thank you.

01:28:35.284 --> 01:28:40.205
MATT: People following the parade, you see faces,
eager for this fresh form of entertainment.

01:28:40.205 --> 01:28:44.947
Children laugh and chatter excitedly, while the
Crown's Guard in their familiar bronze and

01:28:44.947 --> 01:28:50.560
vermilion uniform try to maintain order between
themselves being quite curious or visibly

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:57.028
mistrusting of these hooligans that suddenly have
usurped the evening air. The procession continues

01:28:57.028 --> 01:29:04.174
towards the eastern side, out along the southern
edge of this Loch Ward, to the Ustaloch's

01:29:04.174 --> 01:29:11.500
southern place, towards the new, completely
constructed, large, dark blue tent. Lengthy

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:17.402
streamers of white and silver flap with the cold
winds from the top of the structure. As you guys

01:29:17.402 --> 01:29:23.660
walk, you watch as the horned tiefling you had
approached earlier slowly saunters up to your

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:26.346
side, you recognizing these individuals you had
spoken with earlier.

01:29:26.346 --> 01:29:28.352
MARISHA: I go, Molly! Molly, hey!

01:29:28.352 --> 01:29:30.211
TALIESIN: Oh, it's my favorites. Hello.

01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:32.139
LAURA: We came!

01:29:32.139 --> 01:29:35.380
TALIESIN: I'm so glad you all came to see the
show. It's going to be great tonight.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.729
ASHLEY: (deadpan) It's going to blow you away.

01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:39.828
(laughter)

01:29:39.828 --> 01:29:41.324
SAM: The hype continues.

01:29:41.324 --> 01:29:45.052
ASHLEY: You're going to love it.

01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:49.504
TALIESIN: First show of a round's always the best.
Without fail.

01:29:49.504 --> 01:29:52.179
MARISHA: Where are the best seats?

01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:58.133
TALIESIN: Well, I'm always partial to the front.
Then you're right in it, if something goes wrong,

01:29:58.133 --> 01:30:04.248
it's nothing between you and whatever terrible,
bloody mess is going to happen. It's just the best.

01:30:04.248 --> 01:30:05.810
MARISHA: What?

01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:07.245
TALIESIN: Nothing, nothing, you're fine.

01:30:07.245 --> 01:30:11.992
ASHLEY: It's going to be great, but before you go
in, I do have to give you guys a pat-down, 'cause

01:30:11.992 --> 01:30:13.651
you can't go in with any weapons.

01:30:13.651 --> 01:30:20.013
MATT: At this point, a voice rings out behind you,
you see as the carnival master Gustav glances over

01:30:20.013 --> 01:30:24.141
your shoulder and goes, "You two, skip ahead,
quick. We need to go ahead and set up. Looks like

01:30:24.141 --> 01:30:28.753
"we're already having quite a few people excited to
come here, so at the door, interior to set up.

01:30:28.753 --> 01:30:32.312
"Meet us at the front. Actually, you know what?
You'll be on card duty. We need a little extra

01:30:32.312 --> 01:30:33.687
"change on the side."

01:30:33.687 --> 01:30:35.084
TALIESIN: Card duty it is.

01:30:35.084 --> 01:30:39.447
MATT: "All right. Folks, excited for your
patronage." As he spins around and addresses the

01:30:39.447 --> 01:30:44.833
whole crowd now and says, "Enjoy the night air.
Walk slowly. We need just a moment to set up." And

01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:49.606
the half-elf man bows and tips his large-- it
looks almost like a top hat that gets floppy

01:30:49.606 --> 01:30:54.141
towards the top and flops forward, and he puts it
back on top and begins sauntering, continuing the

01:30:54.141 --> 01:30:58.316
music, but picking up their pace to get ahead of
the crowd as they draw you all slowly towards the

01:30:58.316 --> 01:31:02.532
exterior tent. And that's where we're going to go
ahead and take our break.

01:31:02.532 --> 01:31:04.635
(yelling)

01:31:04.635 --> 01:31:06.904
TRAVIS: Face is on fire.

01:31:06.904 --> 01:31:10.886
LAURA: Am I the only one going, do we really have
to give up our weapons? I don't feel okay with this.

01:31:10.886 --> 01:31:15.869
SAM: Ashley, I'll do whatever you want, but if you
take my weapons I might kill you.

01:31:15.869 --> 01:31:18.102
ASHLEY: I'd like to see you try.

01:31:18.102 --> 01:31:20.549
(yelling)

01:31:20.549 --> 01:31:24.944
MATT: All right, so. We'll be back here in a few
minutes. We're going to take a quick break. We

01:31:24.944 --> 01:31:30.184
have our weekly giveaway from our friends at
Wyrmwood. We have a white oak complete dice tower

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:35.846
system that's a three-piece set. That's going to
be given away to one of you there in the chat. The

01:31:35.846 --> 01:31:48.075
password, if I recall, is 'beginnings'. Yeah. This
one. If you're in the Twitch chat, if you want to

01:31:48.075 --> 01:31:51.563
be part of this, when you're prompted there, go
ahead and enter the word 'beginnings' once. If you

01:31:51.563 --> 01:31:56.940
enter it more than once, you'll get disqualified,
so be careful with that. Otherwise, it gets this

01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:01.705
spamming spree of chaos. So the word is
'beginnings'. When prompted, go ahead and enter

01:32:01.705 --> 01:32:04.865
that, and we'll come back from the break with the
winner of that. Regardless, guys, welcome to the

01:32:04.865 --> 01:32:06.603
beginning of the new campaign.

01:32:06.603 --> 01:32:08.081
(yelling)

01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:09.582
MATT: We'll see you here in a few minutes.

01:32:09.582 --> 01:32:10.442
LIAM: Magic!

01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:11.302
LAURA: Magic!

01:32:11.302 --> 01:49:06.701
[break]

01:49:06.701 --> 01:49:10.388
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Guys!
Wow!

01:49:10.388 --> 01:49:13.570
LIAM: Grenade lobbed in by Foster at the last
second.

01:49:13.570 --> 01:49:18.793
MATT: I know. Welcome back. So, first and
foremost, we have our winner of the white oak

01:49:18.793 --> 01:49:27.433
complete dice tower from our friends at Wyrmwood.
The winner is GTDevoto. Congratulations. Denova

01:49:27.433 --> 01:49:29.801
will reach out to you and get your contact
information. Everyone else, thank you for

01:49:29.801 --> 01:49:33.298
entering. We'll have more with each future episode
of Critical Role, thanks to our friends at

01:49:33.298 --> 01:49:37.059
Wyrmwood Gaming. Also, as a heads-up for those who
aren't familiar and for those who may be, we have

01:49:37.059 --> 01:49:45.555
a Tuesday aftershow of this called Talks Machina
where our friend W. Brian Foster Esq., just mixing

01:49:45.555 --> 01:49:51.438
up all of his names-- you guys know him, Brian W.
Foster, friend of the show, is the host of the

01:49:51.438 --> 01:49:56.699
show, and he'll be there Tuesday talking about
this episode tonight with some of the cast. 7PM

01:49:56.699 --> 01:50:00.476
Pacific time on Tuesday. So. Anyway.

01:50:00.476 --> 01:50:07.175
(laughter)

01:50:07.175 --> 01:50:08.658
MATT: Bringing us back.

01:50:08.658 --> 01:50:10.238
TRAVIS: Bring that ass back.

01:50:10.238 --> 01:50:14.875
SAM: Five dragons swoop down.

01:50:14.875 --> 01:50:16.842
(laughter)

01:50:16.842 --> 01:50:25.575
MATT: It's so hackneyed. As you guys begin to
approach the outside of this large, dark navy

01:50:25.575 --> 01:50:31.435
tent, people are being inspected and ushered
through by the well-groomed half-orc on one side,

01:50:31.435 --> 01:50:37.624
and the pale woman, Yasha, you met for a second
time approaching the outskirts of this carnival,

01:50:37.624 --> 01:50:43.844
with entry fees being collected by both as people
begin to pass into this large structure. A few

01:50:43.844 --> 01:50:49.642
feet off to the side, you see a small crowd
gathered around Mollymauk, who is sitting atop a

01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:55.109
small blanket and has cards splayed before him, a
similar set that you saw Jester toying with

01:50:55.109 --> 01:51:02.634
earlier, and a farmer sits across from him,
listening intently. "All right, so what can you

01:51:02.634 --> 01:51:04.734
"tell me about this here cough?"

01:51:04.734 --> 01:51:10.082
TALIESIN: How long have you had it?

01:51:10.082 --> 01:51:14.584
MATT: "Oh, going on like three, four months."
(coughs)

01:51:14.584 --> 01:51:21.187
TALIESIN: It looks like it's getting better. Oh
yes. Does it feel like it's getting better?

01:51:21.187 --> 01:51:24.112
MATT: "Oh, right now? Yeah."

01:51:24.112 --> 01:51:33.564
TALIESIN: Yeah, look at that. I would maybe
breathe a tincture or something. Let's-- yeah,

01:51:33.564 --> 01:51:35.506
maybe you should get that looked at.

01:51:35.506 --> 01:51:38.991
MATT: "From who? What do the cards tell me?"

01:51:38.991 --> 01:51:44.465
TALIESIN: Some sort of physician, perhaps.

01:51:44.465 --> 01:51:52.051
MATT: "Right! Of course! Oh, thank you so much."
And he places a--

01:51:52.051 --> 01:51:54.441
TALIESIN: Platinum Dragon be with you. Thank you.

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:58.125
MATT: Stands up. "Dear, a physician!" And he walks
off.

01:51:58.125 --> 01:52:01.174
(laughter)

01:52:01.174 --> 01:52:04.532
MARISHA: What happened to 'no sick people'?

01:52:04.532 --> 01:52:07.021
TALIESIN: This is outside the tent.

01:52:07.021 --> 01:52:10.864
MATT: Yeah, he doesn't enter the tent. He goes off
to the side.

01:52:10.864 --> 01:52:12.945
MARISHA: Fair.

01:52:12.945 --> 01:52:16.600
TALIESIN: It's good to see you all here, though.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:25.504
LAURA: Here's the thing. Some of us have weapons
that we don't want to pass away to other people,

01:52:25.504 --> 01:52:31.389
so how much of a chance is it that we could get
through without having to do that, you know?

01:52:31.389 --> 01:52:36.491
ASHLEY: Well, you can't see the show if you have a
weapon on you.

01:52:36.491 --> 01:52:44.313
LAURA: Right. And we really want to see the show.
But, you know, we are really good at security,

01:52:44.313 --> 01:52:51.242
like all of us are really strong, and we could
fight things that came up, too, so maybe it would

01:52:51.242 --> 01:52:53.740
be best if you don't take our weapons, and then we
could help.

01:52:53.740 --> 01:53:02.040
MARISHA: Actually, here's a deal. We'll make you a
good deal. You waive our entry fee and if anyone

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:07.411
needs to be kicked out, or any security needs to
happen, we'll help you out.

01:53:07.411 --> 01:53:09.527
SAM: Like deputy bouncers?

01:53:09.527 --> 01:53:11.415
MARISHA: Like deputy bouncers.

01:53:11.415 --> 01:53:15.378
ASHLEY: Well, see, funny thing about that, though,
is that's my job. So.

01:53:15.378 --> 01:53:17.206
LAURA: So do you want to hire us?

01:53:17.206 --> 01:53:18.385
ASHLEY: No.

01:53:18.385 --> 01:53:23.666
MARISHA: You would be like our boss. Have you ever
wanted to be a boss? Like, in charge?

01:53:23.666 --> 01:53:25.350
ASHLEY: Well, I am.

01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:27.829
LAURA: We could ask you for days off sometimes.

01:53:27.829 --> 01:53:34.814
MATT: A heavy greenish-grey-skinned mitt slaps
onto Beau's shoulder, as you glance over to see

01:53:34.814 --> 01:53:43.952
the large, well-groomed half-orc man standing
there. "I'm terribly sorry, but we've got it taken

01:53:43.952 --> 01:53:48.739
"care of. If you wish to pay entry, you can, but
the rules are the rules. So sorry."

01:53:48.739 --> 01:53:52.433
LIAM: Do they get stored in some sort of locker or
something?

01:53:52.433 --> 01:53:57.190
ASHLEY: I hold them. And if you want, I can stand
right next to you guys. You can keep your eye on

01:53:57.190 --> 01:53:58.958
me the whole time.

01:53:58.958 --> 01:54:00.494
TALIESIN: She's very trustworthy.

01:54:00.494 --> 01:54:02.422
LIAM: That seems fair-ish to me.

01:54:02.422 --> 01:54:05.462
MATT: "Yasha, does that seem-- all right."

01:54:05.462 --> 01:54:12.770
MARISHA: I look at him as I take his hand off.
What's your name, by the by?

01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:14.590
MATT: "Bo."

01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:18.181
MARISHA: Good name.

01:54:18.181 --> 01:54:20.528
MATT: "Thank you."

01:54:20.528 --> 01:54:22.868
LIAM: Well, that's funny, because your name is
also Beau.

01:54:22.868 --> 01:54:25.027
MATT: "Really?"

01:54:25.027 --> 01:54:31.237
MARISHA: You didn't have to-- maybe let me choose
when to tell people--

01:54:31.237 --> 01:54:33.624
MATT: "No, no, I'm curious about this. How do you
spell your name?"

01:54:33.624 --> 01:54:38.321
MARISHA: Well, it's short for Beauregard.

01:54:38.321 --> 01:54:40.097
MATT: "Oh, mine's just B-O."

01:54:40.097 --> 01:54:46.357
MARISHA: That's unfortunate. I mean, it's great.
Did kids make fun-- never mind.

01:54:46.357 --> 01:54:50.317
MATT: "It's not inaccurate." And he flicks the
side of his mustache.

01:54:50.317 --> 01:54:53.381
(laughter)

01:54:53.381 --> 01:54:58.804
LAURA: Like, is his mustache especially B.O.-y?
Like, what? That's really gross.

01:54:58.804 --> 01:55:00.180
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:05.879
LAURA: Ew. I don't want to perceive this. I'm glad
I didn't roll very well.

01:55:05.879 --> 01:55:08.639
MARISHA: Can I make an insight check? Is he a
creep or is he just--

01:55:08.639 --> 01:55:13.559
MATT: Make an insight check. Eight? Thankfully,
you're not in proximity enough to catch a whiff of

01:55:13.559 --> 01:55:14.901
his mustache.

01:55:14.901 --> 01:55:17.305
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:55:17.305 --> 01:55:25.212
MATT: Okay. Interestingly enough, he seems very
well put-together. And he seems like he's just

01:55:25.212 --> 01:55:30.717
fucking with you. He's having fun, and he's
messing with you, and he's just casual and

01:55:30.717 --> 01:55:37.841
competent and actually pretty well-groomed. He
doesn't smell. And he seems more just enjoying the

01:55:37.841 --> 01:55:39.360
discourse.

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:45.601
MARISHA: It's funny, see, my name's Beau because
my parents wanted a son.

01:55:45.601 --> 01:55:56.111
MATT: "Well. If it helps with any other confusion,
call me the Breaker. Well, if you see the rest of

01:55:56.111 --> 01:55:58.304
"the show, perhaps you'll see why I got my name."

01:55:58.304 --> 01:55:59.892
LAURA: Are you in the show, too?

01:55:59.892 --> 01:56:02.071
MATT: And he cracks his arms. "I am. Towards the
end."

01:56:02.071 --> 01:56:04.490
TRAVIS: Now I want to see the show.

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:09.933
MATT: "Well then. May I?" You can see now the
crowd's starting to queue up behind you pretty

01:56:09.933 --> 01:56:14.796
heavily. "Besides, if you're going to enter, we've
got to get through the rest of this riff-raff. Do

01:56:14.796 --> 01:56:16.742
"you wish to join in?"

01:56:16.742 --> 01:56:21.876
LIAM: I pull-- all I have is a dagger, but I just
hand it to Yasha.

01:56:21.876 --> 01:56:23.347
LAURA: Just one dagger?

01:56:23.347 --> 01:56:25.735
ASHLEY: I promise you I will give it back.

01:56:25.735 --> 01:56:27.523
LIAM: Yes, here you go.

01:56:27.523 --> 01:56:29.690
ASHLEY: I promise you I will give you all of your
weapons back.

01:56:29.690 --> 01:56:32.138
LAURA: Pinky-swear me, Yasha.

01:56:32.138 --> 01:56:34.393
ASHLEY: Ugh. I don't like--

01:56:34.393 --> 01:56:38.249
LAURA: Yeah! Now we're best friends. Here's my
sickle.

01:56:38.249 --> 01:56:46.741
MARISHA: I have a staff, but I also use it as a
walking stick, so I like to keep it on me.

01:56:46.741 --> 01:56:49.359
TALIESIN: Can you not walk around without it or
something?

01:56:49.359 --> 01:56:50.714
LAURA: She has a really bad limp.

01:56:50.714 --> 01:56:55.057
MARISHA: Sometimes I get a little twinge, a little
disc issue.

01:56:55.057 --> 01:56:58.609
TALIESIN: Can you hand me your staff so I can
watch this? I want to see this limp of yours.

01:56:58.609 --> 01:57:00.773
Purely for my own entertainment.

01:57:00.773 --> 01:57:04.347
MARISHA: Are you patronizing me, Mollymauk?

01:57:04.347 --> 01:57:06.762
TALIESIN: No, I'm hoping that you're going to
patronize us.

01:57:06.762 --> 01:57:09.290
(laughter)

01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:12.596
MARISHA: Can I keep my stick?

01:57:12.596 --> 01:57:15.443
(laughter)

01:57:15.443 --> 01:57:20.007
ASHLEY: How about this? I'll take it, and I can
just carry you to your seat.

01:57:20.007 --> 01:57:22.271
MARISHA: Deal.

01:57:22.271 --> 01:57:26.251
LAURA: How are you carrying all of these weapons?

01:57:26.251 --> 01:57:28.764
ASHLEY: Because I'm really fucking strong.

01:57:28.764 --> 01:57:31.775
(laughter)

01:57:31.775 --> 01:57:37.057
ASHLEY: You. Can I give him a pat-down, because
you're--

01:57:37.057 --> 01:57:43.282
MATT: Sure, roll an investigation check. I'll give
you advantage because you're really good at this.

01:57:43.282 --> 01:57:45.692
LIAM: I open up the coat just so she can see the
books.

01:57:45.692 --> 01:57:57.277
ASHLEY: I don't think I find anything. 12.

01:57:57.277 --> 01:58:02.654
MATT: You find two books and a modicum of change
and nothing else on him. He's actually pretty

01:58:02.654 --> 01:58:07.147
sparse as far as collectibles and keepsakes.

01:58:07.147 --> 01:58:12.124
ASHLEY: I just thought your chest looked rather
square, so I wanted to see what was happening.

01:58:12.124 --> 01:58:16.368
LIAM: I'm practically concave. Is it concave or
convex, I forget?

01:58:16.368 --> 01:58:17.752
ALL: Concave.

01:58:17.752 --> 01:58:19.120
MARISHA: Convex would be funny.

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:25.886
(laughter)

01:58:25.886 --> 01:58:30.715
SAM: I'll hand her my shortsword, but not my
little crossbow.

01:58:30.715 --> 01:58:33.619
MATT: Okay, make a sleight-of-hand check to try
and hide that.

01:58:33.619 --> 01:58:39.603
SAM: Four. Oh, wait. 12.

01:58:39.603 --> 01:58:42.871
MATT: You have advantage on that, technically,
right? Dexterity checks?

01:58:42.871 --> 01:58:45.399
SAM: Well, did you give me dexterity or just
stealth? How does that work?

01:58:45.399 --> 01:58:48.062
LAURA: I think it's just stealth checks with the
blessing.

01:58:48.062 --> 01:58:50.005
MATT: Let me double-check that real fast.

01:58:50.005 --> 01:58:53.139
ALL: Going to the book.

01:58:53.139 --> 01:58:54.887
MATT: What the heck!

01:58:54.887 --> 01:58:58.265
SAM: We're playing First Edition, right?

01:58:58.265 --> 01:59:00.521
MATT: No, it is stealth. You're correct. Yeah.

01:59:00.521 --> 01:59:04.523
LAURA: Sorry, I wish I wouldn't have said it and
then you could have had advantage just then, but

01:59:04.523 --> 01:59:06.198
I'm not a cheater.

01:59:06.198 --> 01:59:07.531
SAM: No, you're not.

01:59:07.531 --> 01:59:09.143
LIAM: Out of game.

01:59:09.143 --> 01:59:11.675
MATT: You see him slowly pocketing this crossbow.

01:59:11.675 --> 01:59:16.376
ASHLEY: No, no, no. Little girl.

01:59:16.376 --> 01:59:17.791
SAM: I'm just a little girl.

01:59:17.791 --> 01:59:18.987
ASHLEY: Give me your other weapon.

01:59:18.987 --> 01:59:25.698
SAM: This is a toy for little children. All right,
here. I'm sorry.

01:59:25.698 --> 01:59:29.675
LAURA: Are you keeping track of what goes with
what person? Because it's a lot.

01:59:29.675 --> 01:59:30.907
TALIESIN: She's very good at this.

01:59:30.907 --> 01:59:32.107
ASHLEY: I'm very good.

01:59:32.107 --> 01:59:37.886
LIAM: I just drag Nott five feet over. That is two
strikes against you. I think we should really just

01:59:37.886 --> 01:59:40.138
sort of enjoy the show tonight.

01:59:40.138 --> 01:59:42.356
SAM: All right. But what if someone attacks us?

01:59:42.356 --> 01:59:45.526
LIAM: Well, I'll handle that for you, okay?

01:59:45.526 --> 01:59:46.768
SAM: All right.

01:59:46.768 --> 01:59:49.076
MARISHA: Also, little girls don't tend to tell
people they're little girls.

01:59:49.076 --> 01:59:50.827
SAM: This is my first time.

01:59:50.827 --> 01:59:52.983
(laughter)

01:59:52.983 --> 02:00:00.472
LIAM: When someone is a goblin in the middle of a
town where people hate goblins--

02:00:00.472 --> 02:00:03.839
LAURA: Stop saying the word 'goblin'. People are
going to hear you.

02:00:03.839 --> 02:00:07.005
SAM: I mean, she's kind of right.

02:00:07.059 --> 02:00:08.819
(laughter)

02:00:08.819 --> 02:00:13.206
LIAM: Technically, I dragged her away, but you
know, D&amp;D is funny with what is known and not.

02:00:13.206 --> 02:00:14.923
TALIESIN: I heard you over the earring.

02:00:14.923 --> 02:00:16.416
ALL: Aww.

02:00:16.416 --> 02:00:18.056
LIAM: RIP.

02:00:18.056 --> 02:00:20.200
ASHLEY: Wait, I didn't get your weapon.

02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:21.938
TRAVIS: Hah.

02:00:21.938 --> 02:00:30.206
ASHLEY: Do you want to stare at me all day, or do
you want to give me the weapon so you can go watch

02:00:30.206 --> 02:00:31.582
the show?

02:00:31.582 --> 02:00:33.161
TRAVIS: That's an interesting choice.

02:00:33.161 --> 02:00:34.918
ASHLEY: It's not really a choice.

02:00:34.918 --> 02:00:37.906
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:00:37.906 --> 02:00:40.621
MATT: What do you pull out?

02:00:40.621 --> 02:00:41.950
TRAVIS: My falchion.

02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:42.928
SAM: Your what?

02:00:42.928 --> 02:00:48.510
MATT: A falchion, a large, curved sword, emerges
from a sheath on his back.

02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:49.772
SAM: What is that?

02:00:49.772 --> 02:00:51.484
ALL: It's a large, curved sword.

02:00:51.484 --> 02:00:54.040
(laughter)

02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:57.824
ASHLEY: I twist it around a little. Play with it.
This is nice.

02:00:57.824 --> 02:01:00.151
TALIESIN: Very nice.

02:01:00.151 --> 02:01:01.625
ASHLEY: I like it.

02:01:01.625 --> 02:01:04.673
SAM: It's a falchion!

02:01:04.673 --> 02:01:07.512
LAURA: You're going to hang out with us the whole
night?

02:01:07.512 --> 02:01:09.307
ASHLEY: I'll hang out beside you so you can
watch.

02:01:09.307 --> 02:01:12.497
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:01:12.497 --> 02:01:15.983
TRAVIS: 11.

02:01:15.983 --> 02:01:21.319
MATT: 11, that's enough. As she spins the falchion
around, you notice that, affixed to her back, in

02:01:21.319 --> 02:01:28.954
uncharacteristically clean leather towards the
rest of her outfit, what appears to be a

02:01:28.954 --> 02:01:36.464
slung-over sheath and a very large bladed weapon,
larger than your falchion, affixed to her back.

02:01:36.464 --> 02:01:39.489
MARISHA: I just like how everyone says
'falchion'.

02:01:39.489 --> 02:01:42.947
LIAM: It's pronounced 'felching'.

02:01:42.947 --> 02:01:44.996
(laughter)

02:01:44.996 --> 02:01:49.388
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up my cards in a very
specific order very quickly and start stacking the deck.

02:01:49.388 --> 02:01:56.079
ASHLEY: All right, well. If you want to follow me,
I'll take you to your seats and I'll stand beside

02:01:56.079 --> 02:01:57.374
you the whole time.

02:01:57.374 --> 02:01:59.199
TRAVIS: Fucking lead the way.

02:01:59.199 --> 02:02:05.504
TALIESIN: Hey, Jester. Before you go. Tiefling to
tiefling, and thank you for keeping this rabble in check.

02:02:05.504 --> 02:02:07.625
LAURA: Of course, you know, they're a lot to
handle.

02:02:07.625 --> 02:02:11.713
TALIESIN: One on the house. And I pull two cards.

02:02:11.713 --> 02:02:14.868
LAURA: Yes? What are you telling me?

02:02:14.868 --> 02:02:23.191
TALIESIN: I pull the Moon and I pull the Shadow.
Does this mean anything to you?

02:02:23.191 --> 02:02:25.910
LAURA: Oh, yes.

02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:28.120
TALIESIN: Well, think about it. Put it away.

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:32.911
ASHLEY: Beau.

02:02:32.911 --> 02:02:35.653
MATT: Both her and the half-orc turn to you.

02:02:35.653 --> 02:02:45.547
ASHLEY: Little one. I just go over and I
fireman-style over my shoulder. Since you can't walk.

02:02:45.547 --> 02:02:47.818
MARISHA: Oh.

02:02:47.818 --> 02:02:50.223
(laughter)

02:02:50.223 --> 02:02:51.882
MATT: Just carries her right in. Perfect.

02:02:51.882 --> 02:02:55.653
MARISHA: I turn back to the rest of them.

02:02:55.653 --> 02:02:58.907
TALIESIN: Such grace! Such form! Such dignity!

02:02:58.907 --> 02:03:01.500
TRAVIS: The birds are out already.

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:07.573
MATT: At which point, the other Bo, Bo the
Breaker, goes ahead and collects five copper from

02:03:07.573 --> 02:03:12.416
each of you as you pass through, so mark off five
copper, except for the two of you, you guys are

02:03:12.416 --> 02:03:13.965
part of it.

02:03:13.965 --> 02:03:19.500
LAURA: If I skip around, will I be part of the
show and then I don't have to pay?

02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:25.103
TALIESIN: Weirdly, being part of the show means
you strangely pay more. I'm not entirely sure how

02:03:25.103 --> 02:03:26.655
that works.

02:03:26.655 --> 02:03:28.333
LIAM: Nott, do you have five copper?

02:03:28.333 --> 02:03:30.728
SAM: For you, Caleb, I do.

02:03:30.728 --> 02:03:33.525
LIAM: No, I'm not asking. I was going to help you,
but if you have it, you're good.

02:03:33.525 --> 02:03:36.352
SAM: No, you've been spotting me all day, I'll
take care of both of us.

02:03:36.352 --> 02:03:41.074
ASHLEY: Mollymauk. That Jester's adorable.

02:03:41.074 --> 02:03:43.190
TALIESIN: I know. Highly entertained.

02:03:43.190 --> 02:03:44.614
ASHLEY: I like her.

02:03:44.614 --> 02:03:46.122
TALIESIN: I do too.

02:03:46.122 --> 02:03:55.309
MATT: So, stepping into the interior of the tent,
the rocky floor filled with grass and dirt and

02:03:55.309 --> 02:04:02.584
various flattened groundscape on the outskirts of
the Ustaloch, you can see a thick, heavy

02:04:02.584 --> 02:04:11.770
tarp-like material hitting the very edge where the
heavy dark blue cloth hangs from the sides of the

02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:17.686
tent you're within. You can see where the seating is
guided across the floor, and there, already in a

02:04:17.686 --> 02:04:23.342
very packed room, you see a few dozen townsfolk
that have begun to gather in a semicircle. There

02:04:23.342 --> 02:04:27.248
is the entrance flap of the tent where you guys
are walking in. As soon as you walk in, you can

02:04:27.248 --> 02:04:34.678
see a central pillar, a heavy column of wood, a
tree that has been completely rounded off on all

02:04:34.678 --> 02:04:40.999
sides, held aloft to carry the top of the canopy
of the tent itself. And across the way, you can

02:04:40.999 --> 02:04:44.481
see a larger flap tent that is currently closed
that appears to be probably the performers'

02:04:44.481 --> 02:04:51.764
entrance. You can see above you four hanging
lanterns that glow with what seems like a flicker

02:04:51.764 --> 02:04:59.384
of light, but the pattern to them is consistent,
meaning it's not probably natural flame. Children

02:04:59.384 --> 02:05:05.187
and people are beginning to mash around the sides,
and the space along the edges of the interior of

02:05:05.187 --> 02:05:08.558
this tent is starting to get a little cramped.
Where do you guide them, Yasha?

02:05:08.558 --> 02:05:11.148
ASHLEY: Did you guys want to sit in the front
row?

02:05:11.148 --> 02:05:14.266
SAM: That's what we were told is the best seat in
the house.

02:05:14.266 --> 02:05:16.048
ASHLEY: We want to sit in the front row.

02:05:16.048 --> 02:05:22.094
MATT: So there's-- if you consider a semicircle
pattern here, there's-- if you're entering, you

02:05:22.094 --> 02:05:26.319
can go front to the right, front to the left,
front to the center, anywhere in between. Where

02:05:26.319 --> 02:05:28.407
would you like to be currently sitting?

02:05:28.407 --> 02:05:30.653
ASHLEY: Front and center? Or do you want to be on
the sides?

02:05:30.653 --> 02:05:31.916
LAURA: Front and center!

02:05:31.916 --> 02:05:33.657
ASHLEY: I take them to the front and center.

02:05:33.657 --> 02:05:35.398
MATT: Front and center, okay.

02:05:35.398 --> 02:05:38.825
LIAM: I'm going to keep my hand on my meager purse
for the evening.

02:05:38.825 --> 02:05:40.133
MATT: Okay.

02:05:40.133 --> 02:05:44.868
LAURA: As soon as I sit down, I'm going to pull
out my sketchbook and draw the moon and the shadow

02:05:44.868 --> 02:05:47.406
card that Molly showed me.

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:58.507
MARISHA: As we're walking over, I say, hey, Yasha,
'cause I was totally on your shoulder, heard you

02:05:58.507 --> 02:06:01.347
talking about my friend, Jester.

02:06:01.347 --> 02:06:02.727
ASHLEY: Ah, shit.

02:06:02.727 --> 02:06:04.069
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:07.245
ASHLEY: I didn't mean anything by it. I just--

02:06:07.245 --> 02:06:12.452
MARISHA: No, dude. No, she's never mentioned a
significant other, so, I mean.

02:06:12.452 --> 02:06:17.693
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm not looking for anything, I
just--

02:06:17.693 --> 02:06:19.717
MARISHA: Will you hold me through the show?

02:06:19.717 --> 02:06:23.883
(laughter)

02:06:23.883 --> 02:06:29.090
MARISHA: Like, cradle me?

02:06:29.090 --> 02:06:32.138
ASHLEY: That's an extra charge. We do do that,
though.

02:06:32.138 --> 02:06:34.917
MARISHA: How much?

02:06:34.917 --> 02:06:40.648
ASHLEY: Well, it's an extra five gold pieces.

02:06:40.648 --> 02:06:43.139
MARISHA: Five gold?

02:06:43.139 --> 02:06:46.125
ASHLEY: These arms are worth a lot.

02:06:46.125 --> 02:06:50.628
TALIESIN: It's a very swaddling hug. You've never
experienced anything like it.

02:06:50.628 --> 02:06:59.040
ASHLEY: It's the best way to see the show, if
that's how you want it.

02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:09.214
MARISHA: I'll give you five silver just to have
your shrug to sit on so my butt's not on the floor.

02:07:09.214 --> 02:07:13.782
ASHLEY: I don't take off my shrug.

02:07:13.782 --> 02:07:15.995
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:22.600
ASHLEY: How about you just keep your money and
I'll put you in a chair and I'll just watch over

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:24.133
your weapons.

02:07:24.133 --> 02:07:25.446
MARISHA: Okay.

02:07:25.446 --> 02:07:30.222
MATT: So she places you on the ground, as there
are no chairs.

02:07:30.222 --> 02:07:33.710
ASHLEY: On the ground, I mean, because there's no
chairs.

02:07:33.710 --> 02:07:40.817
LAURA: Oh, there's no chairs? Aw. I was picturing
benches. That's okay.

02:07:40.817 --> 02:07:42.612
TRAVIS: There's no benches? Oh, fuck.

02:07:42.612 --> 02:07:44.783
MATT: Where are they going to transport benches
from place to place?

02:07:44.783 --> 02:07:46.225
ASHLEY: That's a good point.

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:49.841
TRAVIS: Carnival? I don't know.

02:07:49.841 --> 02:07:52.971
(laughter)

02:07:52.971 --> 02:07:55.366
MATT: Well, sorry, you have Fletching and Moondrop
to deal with.

02:07:55.366 --> 02:07:57.513
TALIESIN: Bring a cushion from home like a regular
person.

02:07:57.513 --> 02:08:02.589
MATT: So, as the music has died down and everyone
begins to crowd in and whisper to themselves,

02:08:02.589 --> 02:08:09.914
eventually it begins to quiet a bit, everyone
having their seats. The familiar sound of the

02:08:09.914 --> 02:08:18.700
fiddle begins to play, and everyone quickly gets
quiet, down to a hush. The music seems sourceless

02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:26.102
in the interior of the tent. Everyone begins to
look around to see where it may come from. You

02:08:26.102 --> 02:08:30.692
hear points of hushed "look"s, pointing off in
different areas, and at the top of the tent, you

02:08:30.692 --> 02:08:39.033
see, seeming to stretch and fall, like a slow drop
of water, the man in red you saw earlier descends

02:08:39.033 --> 02:08:44.939
from the top of the tent, but now dressed
head-to-toe in a matching deep blue outfit and

02:08:44.939 --> 02:08:55.818
full makeup, to where he appears out of the canopy
of the tent. He hangs from a rope by one foot,

02:08:55.818 --> 02:09:03.069
it's wrapped around and clutched as his foot
catches the edge. Playing his violin

02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:10.601
ever-so-slowly as he carefully descends, and then
at the last moment releases the rope and lands on

02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:19.721
his feet, continuing the music he's playing. He
slowly spins as the longer-haired elf leader of

02:09:19.721 --> 02:09:24.690
the earlier parade that you saw, the one that had
marked back briefly to your two new friends over

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:29.719
here, enters the tent from the distant flaps, the
performers' entrance, his head now sporting that

02:09:29.719 --> 02:09:35.963
same tall hat, flopping backwards at the apex. He
extends his arms, removing the hat, and takes a

02:09:35.963 --> 02:09:38.346
deep bow as the crowd begins to clap.

02:09:38.346 --> 02:09:42.905
(applause)

02:09:42.905 --> 02:09:52.199
MATT: "Ladies and gentlemen of Trostenwald, I am
Carnival Master Gustav Fletching, and allow me to

02:09:52.199 --> 02:09:59.005
"welcome you to the Fletching and Moondrop's
Traveling Carnival of Curiosities."

02:09:59.005 --> 02:10:01.757
(applause)

02:10:01.757 --> 02:10:08.061
MATT: "I ask you, each and every one of you--" You
hear some children giggle as he makes eye contact.

02:10:08.061 --> 02:10:17.591
"--grant us your imaginations this eve but a
trifle bit of time, and allow us to reveal a realm

02:10:17.591 --> 02:10:28.993
"of laughter, mystery, danger, and beauty. I see
you've already met Desmond." And he gestures

02:10:28.993 --> 02:10:35.716
towards the man in all blue who's playing the
fiddle. "He'll be part of our story tonight, so

02:10:35.716 --> 02:10:46.827
"keep a wily eye for the shifting fool. But first,
I tell you a tale of two sisters of the Fey." And

02:10:46.827 --> 02:10:53.983
as Desmond slowly leaves the tent, you see two
armored guards by where he is now have entered,

02:10:53.983 --> 02:11:01.111
two of the Crown's Guard are stepping by the
entrance where he walked in, watch him pass. "Lost

02:11:01.111 --> 02:11:10.620
"without form into the mazes of the underworld.
There, where the body would break, they found a

02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:22.449
"teacher in a mystical serpent, and the gift they
received was the ability to bend with this maze

02:11:22.449 --> 02:11:31.321
"that captured them and slither their way back to
the surface to reclaim their place in the world.

02:11:31.321 --> 02:11:42.175
"May I present to you Mona and Yuli, the Knot
Sisters." As he slowly backs through the

02:11:42.175 --> 02:11:49.178
performers' entrance, the two halfling dancers you
saw earlier, in the full bodysuits, emerge from

02:11:49.178 --> 02:11:57.244
behind the Carnival Master as he discreetly exits.
They sport serpentine makeup, scales affixed to

02:11:57.244 --> 02:12:06.025
the sides of their face and arms. Approaching the
central spire, the pole that holds the tent up,

02:12:06.025 --> 02:12:12.218
one immediately leaps onto the shoulders of the
other, bending her back a near-impossible amount,

02:12:12.218 --> 02:12:19.096
creating this humanoid sculpture that you see the
front row cringe at the idea of the pain that

02:12:19.096 --> 02:12:24.854
would cause an average individual. But these
halflings are very nimble and able to create

02:12:24.854 --> 02:12:32.602
almost a single form out of two bodies. Their
rigid form becomes fluid to the eye as they move

02:12:32.602 --> 02:12:37.698
and shift to the music, the violin now sourceless
once again, not seeing where this Desmond is

02:12:37.698 --> 02:12:41.795
placed, but they seem to move as it picks up
speed.

02:12:41.795 --> 02:12:43.994
LAURA: (whispers) It's like the serpent we fought,
you guys!

02:12:43.994 --> 02:12:47.291
SAM: I was expecting more Ringling Brothers,
actually.

02:12:47.291 --> 02:12:49.593
(laughter)

02:12:49.593 --> 02:12:54.279
MATT: Suddenly, the top one folds over and slams
into the ground, tumbling across the center in a

02:12:54.279 --> 02:13:00.512
wild display of physical control. The two of them
begin to tangle and wrap like two battling snakes,

02:13:00.512 --> 02:13:08.362
their bodies seemingly disconnecting from the
rigid halfling forms you had seen, and you swear,

02:13:08.362 --> 02:13:16.305
for a moment, becoming serpentine-like as they
intertwine around the base of this pole. It's

02:13:16.305 --> 02:13:20.737
beautiful and violent at the same time. It's
off-putting. And watch as they curl around the

02:13:20.737 --> 02:13:27.645
base of this pole, the lights above begin to
become a dull greenish-blue, and get darker and

02:13:27.645 --> 02:13:34.833
darker, presenting this imagery of the underworld.
One by one, they silently tell a tale of struggle,

02:13:34.833 --> 02:13:43.763
crawling across one, then the other, one at a
time, using their serpentine-like forms as an

02:13:43.763 --> 02:13:49.596
extending ladder, folding over each other as they
use every muscle in their body to cling around

02:13:49.596 --> 02:13:59.019
this pole and ladder-step up like a snake. It's a
very strange but alluring sight, and you can't

02:13:59.019 --> 02:14:04.901
help but notice that you forget that these are two
halfling girls, and you find yourself pulled into

02:14:04.901 --> 02:14:12.841
this wordless story they tell of climbing back to
their place, to the surface, towards the dark sky

02:14:12.841 --> 02:14:18.705
of lightless blue cloth. As the baubles that
contain the interior light of the tent begin to

02:14:18.705 --> 02:14:24.342
glow brighter and brighter, their climbing becomes
more fevered. The two of them, arm into arm, leg

02:14:24.342 --> 02:14:29.516
into leg, rolling up and swirling, until
eventually at the apex they grab each other's arms

02:14:29.516 --> 02:14:36.039
around the pole before spinning downward,
back-to-back, legs outward, with a rapid pace, the

02:14:36.039 --> 02:14:43.804
music coming to a full crescendo. Like a Maypole,
they both curl and twirl and then tumble to the

02:14:43.804 --> 02:14:49.272
ground before the audience with a flourish, arms
in the air, and the audience erupts in applause.

02:14:49.272 --> 02:14:52.232
(applause)

02:14:52.232 --> 02:14:58.616
MATT: As they both begin to back away, smiles on
their faces, nodding to each other, Gustav emerges

02:14:58.616 --> 02:15:05.300
once more from the performers' flap. The fool
appears at the back entrance again, taking an

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:13.773
ominous tune with his violin this time, his outfit
no longer blue but deepset black. The hanging

02:15:13.773 --> 02:15:24.204
lights darken once again as Gustav takes the
center stage. "In a flash, beyond the ash, the

02:15:24.204 --> 02:15:35.683
"gods all went and gone. The darkness came to
grasp, reclaim, and suffocate the dawn." Suddenly,

02:15:35.683 --> 02:15:43.898
out of the darkness behind him, a burst of flame
lights the room. "But from that night, a burning

02:15:43.898 --> 02:15:53.083
"light doth keep back shadows' bane. The strength
to fight will set alight the morning sun again.

02:15:53.083 --> 02:16:01.174
"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Ornna the
fire fairy." And Gustav leaves the tent once more.

02:16:01.174 --> 02:16:09.349
As you watch, a pair of metallic fans, alight with
flame, now frame the beautiful woman of short red

02:16:09.349 --> 02:16:16.639
hair you had seen before in the procession. Gustav
slinks into the darkness and vanishes as Ornna

02:16:16.639 --> 02:16:21.932
spins in hypnotic twirl, her simple dress of golds
and reds almost glowing in the firelight around

02:16:21.932 --> 02:16:26.335
her, the flickering of the flames giving her the
visage of a warrior-goddess battling the dark that

02:16:26.335 --> 02:16:31.101
surrounds. The frenzied fiddle of the fool picks
up as she twirls the fans in her grasp, her face

02:16:31.101 --> 02:16:36.258
stoic and graceful simultaneously. The hushed awe
of the audience fills the air, watching this

02:16:36.258 --> 02:16:41.045
magnificent warrior strike at the shadows, the
lights above flickering brighter with each spin

02:16:41.045 --> 02:16:46.281
and dive, banishing the shadows from the room. She
matches the pace of the music, drawing to a

02:16:46.281 --> 02:16:50.504
crescendo, and leaps, and barrel-turns and
climaxes with her striking a powerful pose as the

02:16:50.504 --> 02:16:55.662
lights rocket to a victorious luminescence. Once
again, the crowd goes crazy.

02:16:55.662 --> 02:16:58.664
(applause)

02:16:58.664 --> 02:17:01.399
LAURA: This is really different than most
carnivals that I've gone to.

02:17:01.399 --> 02:17:03.299
SAM: It's very artistic, yeah.

02:17:03.299 --> 02:17:18.431
MATT: Gustav enters as she exits with a bow, the
fans flickering out. He enters clapping at Ornna. A

02:17:18.431 --> 02:17:27.349
low drumbeat begins to beat in the distance as the
fiddle grows tense once more. "Even as the sun

02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:38.527
"would rise anew, bellowing roars will quake the
lands of Xhorhas and beyond. Terrible beasts, now

02:17:38.527 --> 02:17:51.248
"freed from their dark masters, scattered into our
world." (roars) A terrible, guttural roar shakes

02:17:51.248 --> 02:17:57.470
the room, followed by the sounds of grinding and
dragged chains. From behind the performers' flap,

02:17:57.470 --> 02:18:04.146
the half-orc, Bo, who you'd met earlier, the
Breaker, and the fool, who is now still playing

02:18:04.146 --> 02:18:10.807
the fiddle, yet the bow of it continues to go on
its own as he drags the other chain with his arm,

02:18:10.807 --> 02:18:18.597
wrapped around his forearm. The two of them pull
something through the flap. It swells, and from

02:18:18.597 --> 02:18:26.449
beneath it is revealed an enormous creature of
green scales, slimy-looking skin, and a corpulent

02:18:26.449 --> 02:18:33.891
form, large toad-like legs frame a rotund torso,
and muscular arms that are manacled and pulling

02:18:33.891 --> 02:18:39.847
him in. It fights and wrestles against the taut
chains as it's pulled further and further towards

02:18:39.847 --> 02:18:47.372
the center of the tent, but is held in place by
the two men. It roars a second time. (roars) The

02:18:47.372 --> 02:18:52.080
front row immediately pulling back and screaming.
You hear kids begin to cry. A handful of townsfolk

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:55.788
shoot to their feet, grasping the children in
fear, preparing to run.

02:18:55.788 --> 02:18:57.902
LAURA: Have we ever seen anything like this
before?

02:18:57.902 --> 02:18:59.130
MARISHA: Yeah, what's it look like?

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:02.726
LAURA: Well, he just described what it looked
like.

02:19:02.726 --> 02:19:05.126
MARISHA: By name.

02:19:05.126 --> 02:19:12.288
MATT: You have not seen this creature. Gustav
continues, seemingly unflinched by its approach.

02:19:12.288 --> 02:19:20.684
"The devil-toad crawls hungrily--"

02:19:20.684 --> 02:19:23.297
SAM: But what does it look like?

02:19:23.297 --> 02:19:25.089
(laughter)

02:19:25.089 --> 02:19:33.221
MATT: "--into the land of the free folk, lording
over nightmares as they say, and what truth lies

02:19:33.221 --> 02:19:39.730
"behind the eyes of this beast? What would be
learned when the guiding heart of innocence

02:19:39.730 --> 02:19:48.364
"pierces the hateful soul and brings it to see
beauty for the first time? I present to you the

02:19:48.364 --> 02:19:57.317
"vivid voice of Toya." And as Gustav backs away,
the devil-toad struggling against the chains, a

02:19:57.317 --> 02:20:03.317
soft, faint voice begins to slowly emanate from
the air--

02:20:03.317 --> 02:20:05.445
(a voice appears in the background music)

02:20:05.445 --> 02:20:09.675
(exclamations)

02:20:09.675 --> 02:20:17.554
MATT: Eyes previously locked on the frightening
creature now seek a source and find, atop a

02:20:17.554 --> 02:20:27.888
platform within the chamber, high up on a small
platform set against the apex of the pole, a young

02:20:27.888 --> 02:20:37.193
dwarven girl, maybe 12 years of age, her braided
golden hair clasped and her hands at her side, a

02:20:37.193 --> 02:20:46.574
white dress obscuring her feet. She sings with a
mystifying, mature voice that pierces your hearts

02:20:46.574 --> 02:20:56.877
with joy, unexpectedly and uncontrollably. The
crowd audibly gasps as one, the entrancing song of

02:20:56.877 --> 02:21:04.378
this girl bringing every person into this music.
The devil-toad stops struggling against the

02:21:04.378 --> 02:21:11.533
chains, seemingly caught by the sound of her
voice. Its face drops into a soft smile as it

02:21:11.533 --> 02:21:20.571
slowly walks towards the base of the pole and
sits. The half-orc and the fool drop the chains and

02:21:20.571 --> 02:21:28.121
back away, leaving the beast free in its rapture.
Her voice almost begins to summon a chorus from

02:21:28.121 --> 02:21:40.069
the ether, magical in nature, as there are no
others but her joining into this piece. Her smile

02:21:40.069 --> 02:21:46.889
is infectious, and you can't tear your eyes away.
You only now realize the tears down your cheeks,

02:21:46.889 --> 02:21:56.296
but you cannot break your gaze. From the front row
of the audience, on the left, a man stands up, his

02:21:56.296 --> 02:22:03.872
arms outstretched towards her. His dirtied cloak
falls away, his face and skin wracked with age.

02:22:03.872 --> 02:22:14.612
You see his legs shaking as he stands, his cheeks
wet with tears. He shouts (exclaims). His arms

02:22:14.612 --> 02:22:23.457
drop and clutch his chest. Gurgles a burst of vocal pain
once more, and folks nearest to him begin to lean

02:22:23.457 --> 02:22:37.259
away as he begins to shake. You glance over as the
old man yells out once more, as the skin on his

02:22:37.259 --> 02:22:45.940
arms suddenly begins to tear, the bones splitting
from the flesh, writhing, cracking. Dust and blood

02:22:45.940 --> 02:22:50.802
shake from his wounds as his form swells. Screams
begin to ring out from the audience around him,

02:22:50.802 --> 02:22:55.836
people rising up and running for the exit. Chaos
breaks into the room around you. Toya's song

02:22:55.836 --> 02:22:59.991
abruptly ends, the little girl looking down with
fright in her eyes, the devil-toad glancing about

02:22:59.991 --> 02:23:05.175
worriedly, the half-orc and the fool rushing up
beside him to look at the transforming man. The

02:23:05.175 --> 02:23:11.431
half-orc yells, escorting patrons to the exit,
"Everyone! Leave the tent now! Kylre--" As he

02:23:11.431 --> 02:23:16.327
points to the devil-toad. "--get her to safety."
The devil-toad glances up and leaps with a sudden

02:23:16.327 --> 02:23:22.299
gust of strength to the top and grabs the center
pole of the room as it begins to almost quiver to

02:23:22.299 --> 02:23:27.653
his weight. He grabs the little girl safely under
his arm and leaps back down. What are you all doing?

02:23:27.653 --> 02:23:29.248
LAURA: I invoke Duplicity.

02:23:29.248 --> 02:23:36.082
MATT: You watch as her form suddenly dissipates
into multiple seemingly copies of her form as

02:23:36.082 --> 02:23:36.969
Jester.

02:23:36.969 --> 02:23:38.948
TRAVIS: Yasha? We're going to need those weapons
back.

02:23:38.948 --> 02:23:46.169
MARISHA: I turn to Mollymauk and go, man, I
thought it was kind of lame at first, but this is

02:23:46.169 --> 02:23:47.427
awesome!

02:23:47.427 --> 02:23:48.867
TALIESIN: Everyone get out right now.

02:23:48.867 --> 02:23:50.225
MARISHA: This isn't part of the show?

02:23:50.225 --> 02:23:51.407
TRAVIS: Not part of the show.

02:23:51.407 --> 02:23:53.532
SAM: It's too artsy.

02:23:53.532 --> 02:24:02.742
MATT: The old man's body stops quaking, his flesh
now grey and mangled like an ancient tree trunk.

02:24:02.742 --> 02:24:10.081
He turns, his eyes blood-red and bulging, his lips
curled into a horrifying grimace. The two Crown's

02:24:10.081 --> 02:24:13.272
Guard begin to try and make their way through the
panicked crowd, but the people, like a wave of

02:24:13.272 --> 02:24:16.787
chaos, are keeping them at bay. I need everyone to
roll initiative.

02:24:16.787 --> 02:24:19.321
(yelling)

02:24:19.321 --> 02:24:23.861
LIAM: The miniatures come out, guys!

02:24:23.861 --> 02:24:25.904
TRAVIS: First map!

02:24:25.904 --> 02:24:28.715
(yelling)

02:24:28.715 --> 02:24:31.204
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.

02:24:31.204 --> 02:24:34.124
SAM: That bodes well.

02:24:34.124 --> 02:24:38.288
MATT: So you guys, this guy is actually over here.
You guys are all up here in the front.

02:24:38.288 --> 02:24:46.016
LAURA: Oh yeah, we were right in the fucking front
row. Look at us! We're so cute!

02:24:46.016 --> 02:24:50.506
TALIESIN: Oh my god, it's so pretty.

02:24:50.506 --> 02:24:52.882
SAM: We're all going to die.

02:24:52.882 --> 02:24:56.044
LIAM: Probably. But then the third campaign
begins.

02:24:56.044 --> 02:24:57.908
LAURA: Yay.

02:24:57.908 --> 02:25:03.099
SAM: I like the tents and donkeys outside.
Amazing.

02:25:03.099 --> 02:25:08.368
MARISHA: Look, Taliesin, it's a bardo. Oh my god!

02:25:08.368 --> 02:25:15.997
TALIESIN: No, go for it. Oh boy.

02:25:15.997 --> 02:25:19.917
MATT: All right, so. 20 to 15?

02:25:19.917 --> 02:25:21.514
LAURA: 21.

02:25:21.514 --> 02:25:26.289
MATT: All right.

02:25:26.289 --> 02:25:28.143
LAURA: Oh, wait, 22.

02:25:28.143 --> 02:25:31.523
MATT: Nice. 15 to ten?

02:25:31.523 --> 02:25:33.846
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:25:33.846 --> 02:25:34.518
SAM: Ten.

02:25:34.518 --> 02:25:35.381
TRAVIS: 12.

02:25:35.381 --> 02:25:36.047
ASHLEY: 13.

02:25:36.047 --> 02:25:36.998
LIAM: 11.

02:25:36.998 --> 02:25:51.127
MATT: So 13 and then ten and ten? Sorry, 12. So
Yasha got 13, then we have Fjord. And then 11. And

02:25:51.127 --> 02:25:59.731
then we have Nott at ten. And what'd you get?

02:25:59.731 --> 02:26:03.296
MARISHA: Five. Rolled terribly.

02:26:03.296 --> 02:26:13.685
MATT: There we go. Okay, so. Top of the round, as
this creature turns and glares about in the area,

02:26:13.685 --> 02:26:21.035
this swollen form over here to the side, that's
what remains of the old man who had stood up in

02:26:21.035 --> 02:26:23.899
the center of the chamber. Jester, you're up
first.

02:26:23.899 --> 02:26:30.641
LAURA: Okay. Well, I'm just going to go for it,
all right? I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on the

02:26:30.641 --> 02:26:33.648
monster that just appeared.

02:26:33.648 --> 02:26:36.944
MATT: Okay, as it turns towards you. It's a saving
throw, correct?

02:26:36.944 --> 02:26:42.162
LAURA: Let's find out. You make a ranged spell
attack.

02:26:42.162 --> 02:26:44.043
MATT: Go ahead and roll on that.

02:26:44.043 --> 02:26:45.278
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:26:45.278 --> 02:26:47.055
SAM: Magic, you're using magic.

02:26:47.055 --> 02:26:51.061
LAURA: Well, it's cocked. It was 20 and then it
rolled.

02:26:51.061 --> 02:26:53.489
SAM: You said cocked.

02:26:53.489 --> 02:26:54.967
LIAM: You're a cock.

02:26:54.967 --> 02:27:01.317
LAURA: That's 11 plus-- what do I add to my--
Guiding Bolt, plus five. So 16.

02:27:01.317 --> 02:27:02.877
MATT: 16 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:27:02.877 --> 02:27:04.629
LAURA: Yay. 4d6.

02:27:04.629 --> 02:27:06.681
MATT: Yasha, you're almost on deck.

02:27:06.681 --> 02:27:19.539
LAURA: Ten, 16, 18, and then any attacks in the
future-- the next attack has advantage.

02:27:19.539 --> 02:27:21.373
MATT: How much damage was that? 2d6, 18?

02:27:21.373 --> 02:27:23.334
SAM: 4d6, you said.

02:27:23.334 --> 02:27:38.826
LAURA: Yeah, it was 4d6 radiant damage. So yeah,
it was 18. And then I'm going to run the opposite

02:27:38.826 --> 02:27:42.894
direction away from him, but I'm going to keep my
duplicate up there.

02:27:42.894 --> 02:27:46.151
MATT: Okay, which, for your duplicate, I should
go ahead and grab something.

02:27:46.151 --> 02:27:52.046
TALIESIN: Oh, you've got toys.

02:27:52.046 --> 02:27:54.273
LAURA: That backpack's almost as big as my dice
bag.

02:27:54.273 --> 02:27:57.075
MATT: Almost. I was like, that's right, you can do
this, so I need to pull out-- we'll say for the

02:27:57.075 --> 02:28:07.862
purposes of this, you're-- we'll put you-- this
will be your duplicate, wherever you want to move

02:28:07.862 --> 02:28:10.530
it from where you are, so she moves there.

02:28:10.530 --> 02:28:18.878
LAURA: So she's going to stay here. I can't reach
that far, but. Oh, shit, sorry.

02:28:18.878 --> 02:28:20.871
MATT: Just let me know where. There?

02:28:20.871 --> 02:28:24.452
LAURA: Sorry, I didn't realize it was--

02:28:24.452 --> 02:28:25.913
MATT: You can get there.

02:28:25.913 --> 02:28:27.141
LAURA: Okay, sounds good.

02:28:27.141 --> 02:28:32.570
MATT: Okay, so that ends your turn. At the top of
your turn, this creature closest to one of the

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:39.554
people nearby screaming, this young woman who's
trying to back away, it just turns toward her and

02:28:39.554 --> 02:28:48.104
grabs and tries to tear into her with two strikes.
The first one, that is actually going to miss. She

02:28:48.104 --> 02:28:53.653
ducks out of the way and begins crawling across
the ground as it goes for a second attack. That,

02:28:53.653 --> 02:29:01.863
however, does hit, it's a 16. That'll do it. So
with eight points of bludgeoning damage, it

02:29:01.863 --> 02:29:07.177
reaches down and slams its fist into her chest,
and as it does, she gives out this horrible yelp

02:29:07.177 --> 02:29:12.707
as it rips into her and begins gnawing into her
flesh and pulls away with a mouthful of it and

02:29:12.707 --> 02:29:19.634
stands up, its eyes scanning the room for the next
possible victim. It's going to begin to stalk

02:29:19.634 --> 02:29:26.126
forward, coming up to that guy. All right, Yasha,
your turn.

02:29:26.126 --> 02:29:31.790
ASHLEY: Okay. How close am I to them-- I want to
give them their weapons.

02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:35.034
MATT: You're right there. You'd have to-- You're
pretty close to everybody. You could distribute--

02:29:35.034 --> 02:29:39.519
you could use your action to toss the weapons out
to everybody this turn, I'll say.

02:29:39.519 --> 02:29:42.506
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll pass my weapons out this turn.

02:29:42.506 --> 02:29:48.872
MATT: Okay, so you'll spend your action throwing
them out to the individuals. So your shortsword

02:29:48.872 --> 02:29:52.648
and crossbow clatter to the ground, and you
quickly scramble to grab them. Caleb's dagger

02:29:52.648 --> 02:29:58.282
falls at his foot. Your staff gets tossed quickly
from behind you. Your falchion meets your arm.

02:29:58.282 --> 02:30:00.304
SAM and MARISHA: Falchion.

02:30:00.304 --> 02:30:03.642
MATT: All right. That ends Yasha's turn. Fjord,
you're up.

02:30:03.642 --> 02:30:09.482
TRAVIS: Can I run up with the falchion within
melee?

02:30:09.482 --> 02:30:19.640
MATT: You actually rush through Jester's form. You
watch the image dissipate as you charge through it

02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:27.119
and meet up, face-to-face, with this large,
gnarled, horrible-looking creature. What are you doing?

02:30:27.119 --> 02:30:29.597
TRAVIS: Ripping the falchion, can I swing it into
the creature?

02:30:29.597 --> 02:30:31.132
MATT: You may.

02:30:31.132 --> 02:30:33.781
LAURA: And you get advantage.

02:30:33.781 --> 02:30:40.428
TRAVIS: I do? Thank god, because that was a one.
18.

02:30:40.428 --> 02:30:42.164
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:30:42.164 --> 02:30:43.364
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:30:43.364 --> 02:30:46.017
SAM: It's a real fight!

02:30:46.017 --> 02:30:47.167
MATT: Yeah.

02:30:47.167 --> 02:30:48.603
TRAVIS: 11.

02:30:48.603 --> 02:30:52.076
SAM: We've got like a dozen hit points, we'll be
okay.

02:30:52.076 --> 02:31:00.342
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn? All right,
you're done. That brings us to Caleb.

02:31:00.342 --> 02:31:05.151
LIAM: I would like to use my movement to push as
far into the crowd as I can.

02:31:05.151 --> 02:31:06.910
MATT: Okay, going through the crowd is--

02:31:06.910 --> 02:31:11.239
LIAM: Half-movement? That's fine, sure. I just
want people in front of me.

02:31:11.239 --> 02:31:13.871
MATT: Push through to about there. You end up
pushing a kid out of the way.

02:31:13.871 --> 02:31:19.390
LIAM: That's great. That's exactly fine with me
and I will pull out the diamond and cast Chromatic

02:31:19.390 --> 02:31:29.090
Orb, and I will send a ball of cold at the
creature that Fee-ord-- Fjord--

02:31:29.090 --> 02:31:32.396
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a spell
attack.

02:31:32.396 --> 02:31:33.852
LIAM: Yes, here it comes.

02:31:33.852 --> 02:31:35.973
SAM: Watch out for Fee-ord.

02:31:35.973 --> 02:31:40.504
(laughter)

02:31:40.504 --> 02:31:43.163
LIAM: My goodness. That is a 17.

02:31:43.163 --> 02:31:44.916
MATT: 17 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:31:44.916 --> 02:31:47.715
LAURA: Isn't Chromatic Orb like a really strong
spell?

02:31:47.715 --> 02:31:48.793
LIAM: No.

02:31:48.793 --> 02:31:54.377
MATT: There's Prismatic Spray. Chromatic is the
starter version.

02:31:54.377 --> 02:31:55.747
LIAM: That is nine.

02:31:55.747 --> 02:32:00.350
ALL: Nein!

02:32:00.350 --> 02:32:02.135
MATT: (German accent) All right, very well done,
Caleb.

02:32:02.135 --> 02:32:04.661
LIAM: (thicker German accent) Now is the part
where we dance.

02:32:04.661 --> 02:32:09.696
MATT: So as you push the child out of the way,
turn, putting your pocketed diamond out in front

02:32:09.696 --> 02:32:14.746
of you, you focus and you watch as this beam of
light blue energy streaks past, just barely

02:32:14.746 --> 02:32:19.518
coasting between a few heads. It slams into this
creature, as crystals form where the

02:32:19.518 --> 02:32:26.592
wound and impact was. It cracks back into place
where it was. End of your turn? All right. Nott,

02:32:26.592 --> 02:32:27.755
you're up.

02:32:27.755 --> 02:32:36.173
SAM: Okay. Having seen the beautiful dwarven--
girl, was it? Who sang and soothed a monster

02:32:36.173 --> 02:32:44.760
earlier in the show, I'm going to attempt to sing
and soothe this monster. So I step forward and I

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:56.083
open my mouth, and I sing, (singing badly) And I
will always soothe you!

02:32:56.083 --> 02:33:00.673
LAURA: Can I shoot an arrow at Nott?

02:33:00.673 --> 02:33:03.406
LIAM: He's killing the memory of Scanlan.

02:33:03.406 --> 02:33:06.375
MARISHA: I know, can't let that go.

02:33:06.375 --> 02:33:07.983
MATT: Make a performance check.

02:33:07.983 --> 02:33:14.760
SAM: Performance check. Ooh, it's really good. 18,
minus three, so that's 15.

02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:19.634
MATT: Okay. As you're singing out this discordant
sound, folks nearby are covering their ears and

02:33:19.634 --> 02:33:24.830
glancing back and looking in surprise at this
strange creature giving off this--

02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:26.130
SAM: Does it die?

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:31.739
MATT: No. However, it now, after taking a few hits
nearby, its red eyes-- or at least one red eye

02:33:31.739 --> 02:33:36.097
slips over to look in your direction. That's as
much of an effect.

02:33:36.097 --> 02:33:37.275
SAM: Fuck!

02:33:37.275 --> 02:33:39.044
(laughter)

02:33:39.044 --> 02:33:40.363
MATT: Do you want to move, or are you going to
stay there?

02:33:40.363 --> 02:33:46.017
SAM: Yes, I'm going to move, and I'm going to dash
behind somebody in the crowd, some weak-looking

02:33:46.017 --> 02:33:47.437
individual.

02:33:47.437 --> 02:33:52.655
MATT: Okay. You can get behind there. Okay. All
right, that ends your turn?

02:33:52.655 --> 02:33:54.573
LIAM: That's our M.O., baby!

02:33:54.573 --> 02:33:55.813
MATT: Beau, you're up.

02:33:55.813 --> 02:34:05.177
MARISHA: Oh shit, okay. To RP my tragic one on the
first fucking battle a little bit, I'll turn to

02:34:05.177 --> 02:34:13.953
everybody and go, guys, no, it's part of the show.
Molly said that people die. She was just a claque.

02:34:13.953 --> 02:34:26.023
Okay. And then I run and I'm going to tackle the
zombie guy. Can I see if I can grapple him?

02:34:26.023 --> 02:34:30.580
MATT: You can certainly, on the first attack. Go
for it. Make an athletics check.

02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:37.171
MARISHA: Just straight athletics. Oh god. Do I
keep that? It's not good.

02:34:37.171 --> 02:34:39.585
(laughter)

02:34:39.585 --> 02:34:40.898
MARISHA: Seven.

02:34:40.898 --> 02:34:45.754
MATT: 17. You attempt with your first strike, and
the creature just breaks away. Its strength is far

02:34:45.754 --> 02:34:49.564
more than you imagined it would be from what was
originally an elderly-looking frame.

02:34:49.564 --> 02:34:56.765
MARISHA: I go, oh, fuck that. I don't know if
that's true, and I'm going to do a flurry of blows

02:34:56.765 --> 02:35:03.318
and do two, pop-pop. That's unarmed, right?
Pop-pop.

02:35:03.318 --> 02:35:06.360
MATT: That is correct.

02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:09.522
MARISHA: I do two, right?

02:35:09.522 --> 02:35:11.207
MATT: Yes, if you're using your ki point to do
that, yes.

02:35:11.207 --> 02:35:18.152
MARISHA: Yes, I am. So first one, it's plus six?
Okay. First one is 19. No, 20. First one is 20

02:35:18.152 --> 02:35:20.974
total, and then the second one is 15 total.

02:35:20.974 --> 02:35:22.764
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage for each.

02:35:22.764 --> 02:35:28.115
MARISHA: Okay. Not great.

02:35:28.115 --> 02:35:29.612
SAM: What are those dice?

02:35:29.612 --> 02:35:39.573
MARISHA: They're d4s, they're just fancy d4s.
Yeah. That is four, eight, 11 points of damage.

02:35:39.573 --> 02:35:45.873
MATT: Between both? Great. So after the grapple
fails and it pushes you away, you go ahead and

02:35:45.873 --> 02:35:49.859
pull back and then leap, kick it in the chest and
then uppercut it in the chin.

02:35:49.859 --> 02:35:51.239
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool.

02:35:51.239 --> 02:35:58.598
MATT: Looks back towards you. So that would be
putting you up base-to-base with it there. All

02:35:58.598 --> 02:36:02.833
righty. Ending your turn? Okay, at that point, the
crowd is now screaming and begins to swell and

02:36:02.833 --> 02:36:09.136
push in this direction. These folks all begin to
run back and around this way. This crowd begins to

02:36:09.136 --> 02:36:15.227
push, the guards are trying to push forward, and they
can only get a little ways forward to there and

02:36:15.227 --> 02:36:19.057
there. Everyone just shifts out this direction.

02:36:19.057 --> 02:36:21.593
LAURA: God, somebody's going to get trampled.

02:36:21.593 --> 02:36:24.362
SAM: It's really a hazard. They should have had
more exits.

02:36:24.362 --> 02:36:26.234
LAURA: I mean, it's a fire hazard, for sure.

02:36:26.234 --> 02:36:30.749
MATT: Caleb and Nott, I need you both to make
dexterity saving throws.

02:36:30.749 --> 02:36:35.788
SAM: 15.

02:36:35.788 --> 02:36:41.988
LIAM: Oh, pretty good. That is 17 for me.

02:36:42.044 --> 02:36:46.675
MATT: All right. You both manage to just bob and
weave through the crowd to prevent being trampled

02:36:46.675 --> 02:36:50.811
and backing away from the chaos as people are
pushing through. The entrance is too small for

02:36:50.811 --> 02:36:53.823
everyone to leave, and there's now a giant
bottleneck that's beginning to push up as people

02:36:53.823 --> 02:36:58.403
are now screaming and trying to get out. They're
crying, and the chaos is just swelling into this

02:36:58.403 --> 02:37:06.402
absolute cacophony. As soon as that finishes, the
devil-toad carrying the dwarven girl, who was

02:37:06.402 --> 02:37:13.436
given a decree, exits out back with her to get her
to safety. These two begin to slowly back away,

02:37:13.436 --> 02:37:18.176
seeing that things seem to be handled? And the
guards making their way in are looking scared at

02:37:18.176 --> 02:37:23.522
each other, not really knowing what to make of the
current chaos. At that point, you watch as the

02:37:23.522 --> 02:37:27.059
woman whose chest was torn into by this creature
suddenly--

02:37:27.059 --> 02:37:30.049
(groaning)

02:37:30.049 --> 02:37:31.911
MATT: --snaps up into place.

02:37:31.911 --> 02:37:37.476
LAURA: Oh, shit. Okay, we have to keep them from
being dead.

02:37:37.476 --> 02:37:40.462
MATT: Top of the round. Jester, you're up.

02:37:40.462 --> 02:37:42.056
LAURA: Oh, god.

02:37:42.056 --> 02:37:45.661
MATT: What was your initiative again?

02:37:45.661 --> 02:37:46.976
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:37:46.976 --> 02:37:52.350
MATT: Ten, oh, shit. That's right, you're with
Nott, that's what happened. So Molly, you go ahead

02:37:52.350 --> 02:37:54.519
and go for your turn as well. My apologies.

02:37:54.519 --> 02:38:01.949
TALIESIN: I'm going to yell to the back, open the
tent wide! And I'm going to pull-- how far away am I?

02:38:01.949 --> 02:38:05.487
MATT: You're right there. You're in the middle of
the crowd as it's swarming around you and Yasha.

02:38:05.487 --> 02:38:15.947
TALIESIN: (sighs) I'm going to run around and see
if I can flank that creature, if I can move

02:38:15.947 --> 02:38:18.359
towards flanking that creature with the other
two.

02:38:18.359 --> 02:38:22.073
MATT: You can't really flank it, but you can get
next to it.

02:38:22.073 --> 02:38:24.323
TALIESIN: All right. Can I get close enough to
take a shot?

02:38:24.323 --> 02:38:25.415
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:38:25.415 --> 02:38:27.059
TRAVIS: Take a shot?

02:38:27.059 --> 02:38:28.669
SAM: You have guns?

02:38:28.669 --> 02:38:30.206
TALIESIN: Well, old habit.

02:38:30.206 --> 02:38:34.681
(laughter)

02:38:34.681 --> 02:38:39.144
TALIESIN: As a bonus, I'm flipping it out, and I'm
going to activate the first sword.

02:38:39.144 --> 02:38:44.211
MATT: Okay, so you watch as Molly pulls the
scimitar out, and as he unsheathes it, draws it

02:38:44.211 --> 02:38:48.436
across the side of his exposed chest, causing a
little bit of blood to spill out, and as it does,

02:38:48.436 --> 02:38:53.973
he pulls the blade out, and you watch as the edge,
suddenly, ice crystals begin to build on the outside

02:38:53.973 --> 02:38:55.212
of the blade.

02:38:55.212 --> 02:38:58.417
TALIESIN: And I'm taking a shot at the creature.

02:38:58.417 --> 02:38:59.682
SAM: Taking a shot?

02:38:59.682 --> 02:39:01.023
TALIESIN: Taking a slice.

02:39:01.023 --> 02:39:02.283
LAURA: Taking a stab.

02:39:02.283 --> 02:39:04.906
SAM: But with bullets.

02:39:04.906 --> 02:39:09.681
TALIESIN: That's 21 to hit.

02:39:09.681 --> 02:39:11.065
MATT: That hits.

02:39:11.065 --> 02:39:18.879
TALIESIN: That's not bad. That's eight points of
damage and one point of ice damage.

02:39:18.879 --> 02:39:20.847
MATT: Okay, so nine points of damage on the first
strike.

02:39:20.847 --> 02:39:23.063
TALIESIN: No, that was my bonus.

02:39:23.063 --> 02:39:26.517
MATT: That was your bonus, that's all you've got.
Okay. So one strike, you cut across, and you watch

02:39:26.517 --> 02:39:31.982
as you cut this wide wound open, exposing the
fleshy organs' interior, but they're frozen where

02:39:31.982 --> 02:39:35.485
the wound cut through, and it's still holding it
together. It's looking like it's starting to hurt

02:39:35.485 --> 02:39:38.029
a bit and fall apart slightly.

02:39:38.029 --> 02:39:40.280
SAM: This is the bigger monster?

02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:41.696
MARISHA: So it's the one I'm fighting?

02:39:41.696 --> 02:39:46.507
MATT: Yes. So that ends your turn, Molly? Brings
us to the top. So Jester, sorry, back to you.

02:39:46.507 --> 02:39:55.567
LAURA: Oh, now I'm worried. I'm worried about
the undead. I don't know. Well, I don't think I

02:39:55.567 --> 02:40:03.018
would know this, so it's okay. I'm going to say to
the air and say, dude, are you here, because this

02:40:03.018 --> 02:40:12.690
is like the coolest shit we've ever seen! And then I'm
going to cast Toll the Dead on the first zombie

02:40:12.690 --> 02:40:16.917
creature guy. And there's a bell that tolls.

02:40:16.917 --> 02:40:21.224
MATT: Toll the Dead.

02:40:21.224 --> 02:40:24.854
MARISHA: Oh, that's fucking rad, dude.

02:40:24.854 --> 02:40:30.617
LAURA: He has to make a wisdom saving throw or
take 1d12 necrotic damage.

02:40:30.617 --> 02:40:35.228
MATT: Natural one. Go ahead and roll a d12.

02:40:35.228 --> 02:40:38.667
LAURA: Oh, three. That's lame.

02:40:38.667 --> 02:40:48.276
MATT: Three points of necrotic damage. So as this
deep temple bell rings out in the air above, you

02:40:48.276 --> 02:40:52.047
watch as this creature who has turned and is
beginning to just whale upon the surrounding

02:40:52.047 --> 02:40:58.850
allies that are curling at its sides, it seems to
retract from the sound and cover its ears briefly

02:40:58.850 --> 02:41:01.014
before angrily lashing out.

02:41:01.014 --> 02:41:06.960
LAURA: And I made that sound like it was coming
from my duplicate, and my duplicate's going to run

02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:11.528
back a little bit and stand next to the pole.
Yeah.

02:41:11.528 --> 02:41:23.984
MATT: Cool. Is that your turn? All right. The
standing creature that's now been sliced,

02:41:23.984 --> 02:41:30.267
bludgeoned, and wounded by all three of you, is
going to go ahead and make two strikes at-- roll

02:41:30.267 --> 02:41:37.112
randomly to see who it goes for. That's going to
be at Beauregard. It swings at you twice, both

02:41:37.112 --> 02:41:44.823
with its giant massive clawed fists, just striking
out towards you. First one is 17 to hit?

02:41:44.823 --> 02:41:46.648
MARISHA: My armor class is 17.

02:41:46.648 --> 02:41:53.653
MATT: Nine points of bludgeoning damage as the
first one just slams you in the chest. You feel

02:41:53.653 --> 02:41:58.322
the wind knocked out of you for a brief second.
The second swing's going to come at you. That's

02:41:58.322 --> 02:41:59.832
going to be a 20 to hit.

02:41:59.832 --> 02:42:03.156
MARISHA: Yup, yup, that hits.

02:42:03.156 --> 02:42:05.405
TRAVIS: This thing's swinging hard. Holy shit.

02:42:05.405 --> 02:42:07.873
MATT: And that's going to be six points of
bludgeoning damage to you.

02:42:07.873 --> 02:42:11.067
LIAM: What are you at, girl?

02:42:11.067 --> 02:42:15.015
MARISHA: Don't worry about it. I'm bad.

02:42:15.015 --> 02:42:19.786
MATT: It slams into you once with the fist, and
the other one grabs into your stomach, abdomen

02:42:19.786 --> 02:42:25.509
region, and the claws dig in, and its jaw unhinges
and drops like a snake's.

02:42:25.509 --> 02:42:33.009
MARISHA: I turn to Fjord and I go, I'm not a
claque, this show's bullshit.

02:42:33.009 --> 02:42:40.504
MATT: The other one is going to rush over towards
you, Mollymauk, as you're the closest one to it,

02:42:40.504 --> 02:42:43.666
and is going to take one swing at you.

02:42:43.666 --> 02:42:48.059
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I'm going to use Blood
Maladict.

02:42:48.059 --> 02:42:54.876
MATT: Okay, so you're using a reaction? You don't
have to roll anything for it. He just has

02:42:54.876 --> 02:42:55.991
disadvantage on the strike.

02:42:55.991 --> 02:42:57.463
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right, because I'm not
doubling it up.

02:42:57.463 --> 02:43:03.585
MATT: That'll do it. He rolled a 16 and then a
four. So as it swings towards you, you watch as

02:43:03.585 --> 02:43:09.804
suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second
creature go black, and it goes way too wide and

02:43:09.804 --> 02:43:17.457
misses you. You easily duck out of the way of its
first strike. As it runs past, towards you this

02:43:17.457 --> 02:43:21.786
way, you get an attack of opportunity as it leaves
your attack range to attempt to swing around Molly

02:43:21.786 --> 02:43:23.673
for a second strike. Go for it.

02:43:23.673 --> 02:43:24.953
TRAVIS: That is 16.

02:43:24.953 --> 02:43:26.633
MATT: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll damage.

02:43:26.633 --> 02:43:31.089
TRAVIS: Nice. That is 12 points of damage.

02:43:31.089 --> 02:43:37.859
MATT: With this brief opening as it rushes past
Mollymauk, after its eyes go black, you watch as

02:43:37.859 --> 02:43:44.833
it stumbles, its vision ruined. With that moment,
you swing out with your-- falchion, thank you.

02:43:44.833 --> 02:43:50.135
Yeah, it's falchion, that's right-- and strike
across the back of its shoulder. You see what once

02:43:50.135 --> 02:43:58.190
was this beautiful young woman is now this
swollen, horrible undead form lumbering past, and

02:43:58.190 --> 02:44:01.990
you cut a heavy chunk of meat off of its shoulder.
It curves around and makes a second strike at you,

02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:09.757
Mollymauk. This one without advantage. That's a
natural 19. Yeah, that's a 24 to hit. All right.

02:44:09.757 --> 02:44:14.663
You take eight points of bludgeoning damage, as
the first one, you manage to move out of the way,

02:44:14.663 --> 02:44:18.846
and as you spin your scimitar around, you glance
over just in time to have it clock you right

02:44:18.846 --> 02:44:25.649
across the jaw. Your vision blurs and doubles for
a second. That's going to end their turn. Yasha,

02:44:25.649 --> 02:44:26.766
you're up.

02:44:26.766 --> 02:44:27.903
SAM: All right, Yasha!

02:44:27.903 --> 02:44:41.973
ASHLEY: Can I get to the big beast? Beast number
one? Okay, so this is the first time I've done

02:44:41.973 --> 02:44:48.613
this, so hopefully I won't do this wrong. 
I would like to rage.

02:44:48.613 --> 02:44:52.248
(cheering)

02:44:52.248 --> 02:44:56.971
ASHLEY: I'm going to workshop it, I'll make
something later. For now, it's a placeholder.

02:44:56.971 --> 02:45:01.523
Okay, I would like to rage, and reckless attack?

02:45:01.523 --> 02:45:03.996
MATT: Yeah, you can reckless attack any of your
attacks.

02:45:03.996 --> 02:45:07.047
SAM: Is that something you can do right away? That
sounds like a later thing.

02:45:07.047 --> 02:45:13.362
ASHLEY: Is that something you do later? Okay. I
didn't get a practice shot at this. Okay. So I

02:45:13.362 --> 02:45:16.888
just roll.

02:45:16.888 --> 02:45:18.486
MATT: You roll at advantage.

02:45:18.486 --> 02:45:21.167
ASHLEY: I don't know how to play D&amp;D anymore! I
just forgot how to do it.

02:45:21.167 --> 02:45:23.806
LAURA: Okay, but roll again, you have advantage.

02:45:23.806 --> 02:45:30.203
ASHLEY: Oh, reckless. Okay. 17?

02:45:30.203 --> 02:45:31.651
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:45:31.651 --> 02:45:35.222
ASHLEY: I take out my beautiful greatsword.

02:45:35.222 --> 02:45:39.268
MATT: Freshly purchased. In fact, this is the
first time it's seen battle.

02:45:39.268 --> 02:45:41.492
ASHLEY: It is the first time it's seen battle.

02:45:41.492 --> 02:45:46.360
SAM: Google reported a weird influx of 'falchion'
searches.

02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:49.002
(laughter)

02:45:49.002 --> 02:45:50.897
ASHLEY: 13.

02:45:50.897 --> 02:45:53.396
MATT: On the one that's already been damaged?

02:45:53.396 --> 02:45:56.800
ASHLEY: Yeah. The first guy.

02:45:56.800 --> 02:45:58.200
MATT: Yeah, all right.

02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:00.608
ASHLEY: Get the fuck out of my tent!

02:46:00.608 --> 02:46:03.794
(laughter)

02:46:03.794 --> 02:46:14.733
MATT: Yeah, no, it does not make the save-- it
rolled-- yeah. So as you come down with your blade

02:46:14.733 --> 02:46:20.737
and carve through its body, you watch as it curls
back, trying to reform and hold itself, but your

02:46:20.737 --> 02:46:27.778
blow was too strong, and its zombie-ish form
cannot maintain a cohesive hold on its form, and

02:46:27.778 --> 02:46:30.294
you watch as it just crumbles to the ground, no
longer moving.

02:46:30.294 --> 02:46:32.761
(cheering)

02:46:32.761 --> 02:46:34.028
SAM: Yasha!

02:46:34.028 --> 02:46:37.390
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

02:46:37.390 --> 02:46:44.348
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. As you're there,
growling animalistically towards the creature.

02:46:44.348 --> 02:46:46.875
ASHLEY: Ooh, that feels fun.

02:46:46.875 --> 02:46:50.255
MATT: You have about five more feet of movement,
if you wanted to move.

02:46:50.255 --> 02:46:55.975
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit
closer to-- wait, how many more are left? Just

02:46:55.975 --> 02:47:00.912
the other one? Yeah, so I'll get ready for the
other one. So a little bit closer to it.

02:47:00.912 --> 02:47:07.440
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Yasha.
Fjord, you're up.

02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:16.518
TRAVIS: Shit. I'll turn and head towards
other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my

02:47:16.518 --> 02:47:20.321
bonus action to cast Hex on it.

02:47:20.321 --> 02:47:27.870
MATT: Okay. So you watch as Fjord lumbers towards
it, his large, armored half-orc form holding the

02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:34.707
blade in his hand. Puts his hand out, and the
shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this

02:47:34.707 --> 02:47:41.852
zombified woman's form and cling to it, like it's
holding it in place. So with it now hexed, what

02:47:41.852 --> 02:47:43.231
would you like to do?

02:47:43.231 --> 02:47:49.456
TRAVIS: I would like to use my falchion to open it
the fuck up.

02:47:49.456 --> 02:47:51.252
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:47:51.252 --> 02:47:53.878
TRAVIS: 21.

02:47:53.878 --> 02:47:56.429
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

02:47:56.429 --> 02:48:04.778
TRAVIS: That's 12 points of damage, plus five
points of necrotic damage.

02:48:04.778 --> 02:48:06.435
MATT: 17 points of damage.

02:48:06.435 --> 02:48:08.955
LIAM: Level two, that's major.

02:48:08.955 --> 02:48:14.749
MATT: So, as you rush up, after the shadows gather
around it, it looks up to you, and it pulls back,

02:48:14.749 --> 02:48:20.690
ready to strike, and you just shake your head, and
one large swipe of your falchion carves this giant

02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:27.441
mark across its chest. Where the cloth and flesh
opens, you can see this blackened interior, where

02:48:27.441 --> 02:48:32.779
the muscles are trying to move, almost like worms,
to regather and tighen. All right, that ends your

02:48:32.779 --> 02:48:35.284
turn. That brings us to Caleb.

02:48:35.284 --> 02:48:39.055
LIAM: All right, I know that it's restricted
movement, but I will push this way through the

02:48:39.055 --> 02:48:44.217
crowd so that I have a clearer shot, as far as I
can, and then I will re-up with Chromatic Orb.

02:48:44.217 --> 02:48:48.237
MATT: You can push right about there. You just
barely pull through the crowd to the front to get

02:48:48.237 --> 02:48:49.208
a clear--

02:48:49.208 --> 02:48:50.144
LAURA: Hi, Caleb.

02:48:50.144 --> 02:48:54.424
LIAM: I certainly don't want to do that. I want to
stay in the crowd, behind people, and I will do

02:48:54.424 --> 02:49:03.104
Chromatic Orb again, but this time, I'm going to set it
to acid, so see if it hit. Oh, that's not good,

02:49:03.104 --> 02:49:04.089
it's 11.

02:49:04.089 --> 02:49:10.857
MATT: 11 unfortunately does not hit. So as you
pull it out a second time, you're pushing through

02:49:10.857 --> 02:49:13.967
the crowd and you pull up your diamond, and right
as you're about to release the spell, one of the

02:49:13.967 --> 02:49:18.368
people in the crowd slams into you with her
shoulder and you get jarred off to the side. The

02:49:18.368 --> 02:49:22.922
acid bolt of the Chromatic Orb flies off and
actually burns a hole through the distant tent and

02:49:22.922 --> 02:49:25.438
then vanishes into the night sky.

02:49:25.438 --> 02:49:27.764
LIAM: Hope that didn't hit anyone.

02:49:27.764 --> 02:49:29.762
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Caleb. Nott,
you're up.

02:49:29.762 --> 02:49:35.454
SAM: Do I have eyes on the biggie? Is Fjord right
next to her?

02:49:35.454 --> 02:49:38.665
MATT: Fjord and Mollymauk are both next to it,
yes.

02:49:38.665 --> 02:49:45.019
SAM: All right. I'm going to peek out behind
whatever patron I'm next to, take out my little

02:49:45.019 --> 02:49:48.126
crossbow and just shoot a little shot.

02:49:48.126 --> 02:49:49.471
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:49:49.471 --> 02:49:50.720
TRAVIS: Is it made of piano wire?

02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:53.351
(laughter)

02:49:53.351 --> 02:49:55.445
SAM: 16.

02:49:55.445 --> 02:49:56.451
MATT: 16 hits.

02:49:56.451 --> 02:49:58.174
LAURA: I like how every time you roll it comes
out.

02:49:58.174 --> 02:50:05.217
SAM: It does. This is very bouncy. Okay, so 1d6,
that's a four, plus four is eight, plus I get

02:50:05.217 --> 02:50:13.693
sneak attack damage, 'cause I'm a rogue. Another
four, so that's 12. Is the creature bigger than

02:50:13.693 --> 02:50:17.198
me? I will use Fury of the Small.

02:50:17.198 --> 02:50:19.758
(cheering)

02:50:19.758 --> 02:50:24.741
SAM: To inflict another two points of damage, so
that's 14 points of damage.

02:50:24.741 --> 02:50:32.745
MATT: Okay. As you pull around the corner and
release your one crossbow bolt, it hits the bottom

02:50:32.745 --> 02:50:38.080
of the chin and pokes out one of the eyes. The eye
goes flying off into the distance as the bolt is

02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:45.748
now jammed outside of the socket. The creature
turns, glancing your direction. It looks pretty

02:50:45.748 --> 02:50:47.712
hurt, but it's still standing.

02:50:47.712 --> 02:50:54.703
SAM: Can I use the rest of my
action-movement-whatever bonus to look at the

02:50:54.703 --> 02:51:01.536
patron I'm next to. Do they have any baubles or
jewelry on them?

02:51:01.536 --> 02:51:04.241
TRAVIS: In this moment?

02:51:04.241 --> 02:51:11.686
MATT: I'll say you can use your bonus action to
just look. There's nothing you can do this turn,

02:51:11.686 --> 02:51:14.602
but next turn, you could. So make a perception
check.

02:51:14.602 --> 02:51:17.018
SAM: Oh, it's just nine.

02:51:17.018 --> 02:51:25.435
MATT: Nine? It's hard to look. You see this what
looks to be late-30s woman dressed in some sort of

02:51:25.435 --> 02:51:31.684
general workers' clothing with a loose apron, and
she's just running and scrambling to get towards

02:51:31.684 --> 02:51:35.579
the exit. You don't see anything of worth on her,
unfortunately. Sorry. All right, Nott, that ends

02:51:35.579 --> 02:51:37.162
your turn. Molly, you're up.

02:51:37.162 --> 02:51:42.566
TALIESIN: I'm still engaged with it, right? Okay,
I'm going to take two swipes.

02:51:42.566 --> 02:51:47.034
MATT: Okay, so you spin around. You pull your
second scimitar out, as part of the strike, one of

02:51:47.034 --> 02:51:51.123
them encased in ice crystals. So the first
strike-- make sure you mark which one's which.

02:51:51.123 --> 02:51:58.599
TALIESIN: Purple's the ice. That's-- the purple is
12 to hit?

02:51:58.599 --> 02:51:59.961
MATT: 12 just barely hits.

02:51:59.961 --> 02:52:07.315
TALIESIN: Ooh. So they both hit, so that's good.
So that's going to be-- or all three, then, because

02:52:07.315 --> 02:52:09.755
the other one is 21 to hit.

02:52:09.755 --> 02:52:11.286
MATT: That hits, yeah.

02:52:11.286 --> 02:52:13.977
TALIESIN: The first one is four points of damage.

02:52:13.977 --> 02:52:15.396
MATT: Four points of damage?

02:52:15.396 --> 02:52:24.506
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, the magic one is six points
plus three ice, so nine points.

02:52:24.506 --> 02:52:26.063
MATT: Nine points of damage, all right.

02:52:26.063 --> 02:52:27.451
TALIESIN: The other one is four points of damage.

02:52:27.451 --> 02:52:36.463
MATT: Okay. So the first strike hits, and as the
scimitar carves through, the body snaps and opens,

02:52:36.463 --> 02:52:43.500
and it snaps back into place, the torso locking
back in. The second strike does how much damage?

02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:44.711
TALIESIN: Four points of damage.

02:52:44.711 --> 02:52:50.591
MATT: Yeah. The second one hits again, and you
watch as the torso spins off. It looks like only the

02:52:50.591 --> 02:52:55.620
spinal column is holding it in place, but it's
managing to maintain its structure as it (snarls).

02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:58.149
That ends your turn.

02:52:58.149 --> 02:53:00.588
TALIESIN: Someone, anyone? Yep.

02:53:00.588 --> 02:53:03.240
MATT: All right, ending Mollymauk's turn, that
brings us to Beau.

02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:05.837
LAURA: Beau, you got this.

02:53:05.837 --> 02:53:10.444
MARISHA: In response to him, I say, I thought you
said you didn't let in the sick!

02:53:10.444 --> 02:53:12.084
TALIESIN: Just kill it!

02:53:12.084 --> 02:53:16.593
MARISHA: I come up and I want to do a flying
Superman (impact).

02:53:16.593 --> 02:53:20.408
MATT: Wham! Go for it.

02:53:20.408 --> 02:53:23.692
MARISHA: First one. Okay. 16?

02:53:23.692 --> 02:53:25.253
MATT: That'll hit. Damage.

02:53:25.253 --> 02:53:30.136
MARISHA: I had my staff-- oh, I had my staff, but
I said--

02:53:30.136 --> 02:53:32.532
LIAM: You said Superman punch, man.

02:53:32.532 --> 02:53:38.630
MARISHA: It's fine, it's fine. Six damage.

02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:45.034
MATT: Six points of damage. Natural 20. You watch
as you sock it in the face and the jaw breaks and

02:53:45.034 --> 02:53:49.433
then snaps back into place. As you land, pulling
it back, you can see some of the teeth are

02:53:49.433 --> 02:53:53.317
actually stuck in your fist as you pull back,
they've broken off into your knuckles.

02:53:53.317 --> 02:53:58.002
MARISHA: I go, oh, come on. I'm going to use my
other ki point to do flurry of blows again, and

02:53:58.002 --> 02:54:07.836
I'm going to try and punch him in the bridge with
the remainder of his teeth.

02:54:07.836 --> 02:54:10.819
MATT: Her teeth, technically, this is the woman
that was killed originally.

02:54:10.819 --> 02:54:13.595
MARISHA: Oh. I'll be like, you were so pretty,
too.

02:54:13.595 --> 02:54:16.594
MATT: Go for it. Two more strikes.

02:54:16.594 --> 02:54:24.898
MARISHA: 19 and 18. Natural. And then, okay.

02:54:24.898 --> 02:54:27.044
LAURA: That's a really pretty dice.

02:54:27.044 --> 02:54:31.563
MARISHA: Eight, 12, 13 damage.

02:54:31.563 --> 02:54:39.220
MATT: Natural one, no. So the second punch, you
swing wide and hit the side of the head, and the neck

02:54:39.220 --> 02:54:45.815
snaps, and it's now stuck in a sideways position.
As it turns, the jaw, it pulls back one of its

02:54:45.815 --> 02:54:51.671
weirdly swollen clawed hands, ready to go for that
open wound in your gut, and as it does,

02:54:51.671 --> 02:54:53.923
how do you want to do this?

02:54:53.923 --> 02:54:56.349
(cheering)

02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:58.252
TRAVIS: First one!

02:54:58.252 --> 02:54:59.677
SAM: First blood.

02:54:59.677 --> 02:55:06.197
MARISHA: I'll do the uppercut with the other one,
and the one that has its teeth in it, I want to go

02:55:06.197 --> 02:55:12.057
right between the bridge of the nose and get the
teeth right in the eyes and break the nose bridge

02:55:12.057 --> 02:55:15.145
into the brain. You know that thing? Yeah.

02:55:15.145 --> 02:55:19.094
MATT: And as you do that, you slam into its face.
You watch as the skull caves in, the teeth

02:55:19.094 --> 02:55:25.507
piercing both of the red, bulging eyes. And with
this horrible sucking, sighing sound, it falls

02:55:25.507 --> 02:55:31.942
onto its back, no longer moving, the shadows
released.

02:55:31.942 --> 02:55:40.915
MARISHA: I grab my gash and fucked-up ribs and
immediately turn over me. Can I do a perception

02:55:40.915 --> 02:55:45.521
check or an insight check on any of the
ringleaders? On any of what was going on? The

02:55:45.521 --> 02:55:46.807
ringleader or the jester?

02:55:46.807 --> 02:55:53.258
MATT: That was your turn, unfortunately. That's
your turn. At this point, the current threats are

02:55:53.258 --> 02:55:59.243
down, and the crowd is screaming and rushing. The
two members of the Crown's Guard are rushed to the

02:55:59.243 --> 02:56:03.850
front, weapons ready, and they see both of these
creatures bloodied and ruined across the base of

02:56:03.850 --> 02:56:09.598
this. In the midst of the chaos, one of them
points and goes, "You, you! Stay where you are!"

02:56:09.598 --> 02:56:15.684
And you watch as the rest of the crowd slowly
pushes through, you see as Gustav

02:56:15.684 --> 02:56:21.704
manages to make his way in. "Dear god, what's
happened here?" Looks over toward Bo the Breaker,

02:56:21.704 --> 02:56:27.402
the half-orc who's now joined the rest of you.
"Sir, I don't know how he got in here." And

02:56:27.402 --> 02:56:33.494
everyone looks around back at you. Bo looks at
you, Gustav looks to you, Molly. "What happened?"

02:56:33.494 --> 02:56:35.948
TALIESIN: One of them turned. I don't know what
happened.

02:56:35.948 --> 02:56:42.636
LAURA: There was a sick guy! There was an old sick
guy and he turned into a zombie! And I run over

02:56:42.636 --> 02:56:44.956
and I cast Cure Wounds on Beau.

02:56:44.956 --> 02:56:48.505
MARISHA: Oh, thank you, man. I'm really down.

02:56:48.505 --> 02:56:56.225
LAURA: Are you sick too? Did you get hurt? Hold on
two seconds. I'm going to cure her and then I'll

02:56:56.225 --> 02:56:57.970
cure you too.

02:56:57.970 --> 02:57:00.470
TRAVIS: Yasha, have you ever seen anything like
this happen before?

02:57:00.470 --> 02:57:03.677
ASHLEY: No. Never.

02:57:03.677 --> 02:57:06.846
LAURA: Seven points, that's all I could cure.

02:57:06.846 --> 02:57:09.870
MARISHA: That's amazing. That's great.

02:57:09.870 --> 02:57:12.396
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop my sword.

02:57:12.396 --> 02:57:14.347
LAURA: Oh, that's better for you, ten for you.

02:57:14.347 --> 02:57:20.473
MATT: Okay. At this point, the two Crown's Guard
that are there are trying desperately to maintain

02:57:20.473 --> 02:57:25.453
control. You can see they're visibly shaken, and
they glance at each other like they're a little

02:57:25.453 --> 02:57:29.864
out of their depths at the moment. "Stay where you
are. Don't go anywhere."

02:57:29.864 --> 02:57:32.231
TALIESIN: Oh, wherever will I go.

02:57:32.231 --> 02:57:35.683
MATT: And he turns to the one who's in the front,
looks to the other one who just made his way

02:57:35.683 --> 02:57:44.041
through, and goes, "Sivelmen, find someone. Bring
the rest of the guard. Please!" "Right now, sir."

02:57:44.041 --> 02:57:50.216
And he pushes his way towards the back as the rest
of the crowd runs out. Now everyone in the crowd

02:57:50.216 --> 02:57:55.594
has mostly pushed out of the tent, the last few
dregs pushing through. Children crying, people of

02:57:55.594 --> 02:58:00.538
Trostenwald just exiting out the flaps as they
close, and you're all standing there, weapons in

02:58:00.538 --> 02:58:02.336
your hands, wondering what to do.

02:58:02.336 --> 02:58:04.315
TRAVIS: What are the corpses doing now that
they've fallen?

02:58:04.315 --> 02:58:07.859
MATT: They're both unmoving, ruined, torn apart.

02:58:07.859 --> 02:58:11.851
LAURA: Can I search the corpse of the woman?

02:58:11.851 --> 02:58:16.936
MATT: You can. As you go to move to it, both of
your forms merge. The Crown's Guard goes like,

02:58:16.936 --> 02:58:18.518
"Don't move."

02:58:18.518 --> 02:58:20.482
LAURA: Which one?

02:58:20.482 --> 02:58:26.364
MATT: "Both? Uh." He looks genuinely confused.

02:58:26.364 --> 02:58:31.838
LAURA: When I'm going "which one?" I make my
second form just dart forward and start searching

02:58:31.838 --> 02:58:33.232
the body.

02:58:33.232 --> 02:58:39.694
MATT: Okay. It mimics searching a body. It's not
actually you. Begins rifling imaginary things out

02:58:39.694 --> 02:58:41.005
of the pockets.

02:58:41.005 --> 02:58:43.391
LAURA: Look at all the stuff that that one's
finding over there!

02:58:43.391 --> 02:58:45.728
(laughter)

02:58:45.728 --> 02:58:48.192
LAURA: Can he turn and look and I try to search
the other guy?

02:58:48.192 --> 02:58:53.045
MATT: Make a deception check to try and deceive
him to glance over.

02:58:53.045 --> 02:58:57.931
LAURA: Not bad. 19?

02:58:57.931 --> 02:59:05.551
MATT: (laughs) He goes, "What, over there?" Looks
over as you jump over quickly and begin searching

02:59:05.551 --> 02:59:08.929
through it, and you guys watch her do this, and
there's a clear line of sight. As soon as he turns

02:59:08.929 --> 02:59:11.952
back, he's going to notice her rifling through the
other corpse.

02:59:11.952 --> 02:59:14.045
ASHLEY: Is Gustav still in here?

02:59:14.045 --> 02:59:21.219
MATT: Gustav is now walking up, and he's hands up
in the air. "I'm terribly sorry. I-- this has

02:59:21.219 --> 02:59:23.502
"never happened. I don't know what happened. What
happened?!"

02:59:23.502 --> 02:59:29.084
TALIESIN: We've never seen anything like it
before. He just-- he gripped his heart and fell

02:59:29.084 --> 02:59:30.862
over and turned into that thing.

02:59:30.862 --> 02:59:34.849
ASHLEY: It was when Toya started singing.

02:59:34.849 --> 02:59:37.687
MARISHA: Yeah, what's with the dwarven girl?
Why--

02:59:37.687 --> 02:59:39.048
TALIESIN: Nothing like this.

02:59:39.048 --> 02:59:42.459
MATT: "She's been singing with us for over two
years, now."

02:59:42.459 --> 02:59:45.206
MARISHA: How'd she come to you? She's a pretty
young girl.

02:59:45.206 --> 02:59:50.726
MATT: "She had no family and she was singing in
the street for change. There was an opportunity.

02:59:50.726 --> 02:59:53.664
"We seized it. We gave her a family she didn't
have."

02:59:53.664 --> 02:59:55.230
TRAVIS: Put your hands down.

02:59:55.230 --> 03:00:01.124
MATT: The Crown's Guard goes like (grunts). "It's
fine, just don't move."

03:00:01.124 --> 03:00:04.573
LAURA: Did I find anything?

03:00:04.573 --> 03:00:06.884
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:00:06.884 --> 03:00:10.909
SAM: She uses a different dice for everything,
Travis?

03:00:10.909 --> 03:00:11.967
LAURA: Shut up.

03:00:11.967 --> 03:00:13.433
SAM: Is that what I'm dealing with now?

03:00:13.433 --> 03:00:14.825
TRAVIS: You're not even ready.

03:00:14.825 --> 03:00:16.276
LAURA: 14?

03:00:16.276 --> 03:00:31.420
MATT: You manage to rifle through the old man's
body, through the stringy bits of gore, and you do

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:44.331
find three pieces of silver that are just coated
in blood. A few moments pass. The rest of the

03:00:44.331 --> 03:00:50.267
people are gone, and it's just this awkward quiet,
and at this point you watch as Ornna, the fire

03:00:50.267 --> 03:00:55.662
fairy who had previously performed, walks in and
is like, "I'm sorry. What has happened here?"

03:00:55.662 --> 03:01:01.472
LAURA: Your little dwarf girl was singing, and she
turns people into zombies.

03:01:01.472 --> 03:01:04.726
TALIESIN: I feel that that was entirely
coincidental. I'm really not sure that the two

03:01:04.726 --> 03:01:08.486
things were related. Something was wrong with this
man.

03:01:08.486 --> 03:01:11.835
MARISHA: See, it's interesting, because I would
say the opposite. I would say it wasn't that

03:01:11.835 --> 03:01:13.176
coincidental, because--

03:01:13.176 --> 03:01:15.218
LIAM: I would agree, it seemed to happen with
this--

03:01:15.218 --> 03:01:19.159
TALIESIN: We've seen her sing dozens, hundreds of
times. Nothing like this has ever happened. I've

03:01:19.159 --> 03:01:22.500
seen people sit in the front row hundreds of
times. Nothing like this has ever happened.

03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:24.670
LIAM: Have you had the elderly or the sick in
these tents before?

03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:30.317
MARISHA: Yeah, you also happen to be very explicit
on your page that you don't want the sick, so.

03:01:30.317 --> 03:01:31.529
TALIESIN: Gustav.

03:01:31.529 --> 03:01:37.008
MATT: At this motion, Gustav goes, "It's generally
just because we want to promote a space of

03:01:37.008 --> 03:01:44.365
"welcoming cleanliness. When we're working amongst
the outskirts of the Empire, we don't want to

03:01:44.365 --> 03:01:47.809
"bring an element that reminds you of death and--"

03:01:47.809 --> 03:01:50.779
SAM: You hate old people so much.

03:01:50.779 --> 03:01:57.389
MATT: "Well, we're in entertainment. We have to be
cautious." The single Crown's Guard guy who's

03:01:57.389 --> 03:02:00.808
sitting there with his weapon out, you can see him
shaking almost, he's never had to deal with

03:02:00.808 --> 03:02:02.571
anyting like this before.

03:02:02.571 --> 03:02:07.841
TALIESIN: Hold up. I've never seen that one
before. He looks really suspicious.

03:02:07.841 --> 03:02:09.406
MATT: Towards him?

03:02:09.406 --> 03:02:11.278
TALIESIN: No, the guy behind him.

03:02:11.278 --> 03:02:13.829
LAURA: (gasps) He does look suspicious.

03:02:13.829 --> 03:02:15.258
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:02:15.258 --> 03:02:20.068
TALIESIN: Sure. Eight.

03:02:20.068 --> 03:02:27.312
MATT: He goes, "Don't try that on me. I've been
doing this for over ten years."

03:02:27.312 --> 03:02:29.136
ASHLEY: Oh wait, look at him!

03:02:29.136 --> 03:02:32.653
LAURA: I cast Thaumaturgy and make it sound like
there's a sound coming from behind him, too.

03:02:32.653 --> 03:02:36.873
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check to see if you
can cast this spell subtly enough or not.

03:02:36.873 --> 03:02:38.933
SAM: This poor guard. Ooh!

03:02:38.933 --> 03:02:42.815
(groaning)

03:02:42.815 --> 03:02:44.297
LAURA: Natural one.

03:02:44.297 --> 03:02:48.971
MATT: As you attempt to cast this spell, a little
bit of spittle gets caught in your windpipe, and

03:02:48.971 --> 03:02:53.913
you begin to cough uncontrollably. Yeah, it just
falls away.

03:02:53.913 --> 03:02:57.221
LAURA: (coughing) There was some popcorn that I
ate earlier.

03:02:57.221 --> 03:03:01.756
TRAVIS: You should know that whatever happened to
that first man when he attacked the woman, she

03:03:01.756 --> 03:03:03.476
caught whatever he had.

03:03:03.476 --> 03:03:09.528
MATT: "And that is extremely worrying. Nobody
touch that body." And he looks back and sees you

03:03:09.528 --> 03:03:16.174
coughing over the corpse, and the guy's like,
"Don't you touch that body! Are you sick?"

03:03:16.174 --> 03:03:18.452
LAURA: (coughing) I have bloody fingers.

03:03:18.452 --> 03:03:22.320
MATT: "Someone hold her down. If she's sick and
turns into one of these, I will not--"

03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:26.044
ASHLEY: She's fine. Just calm down.

03:03:26.044 --> 03:03:27.872
TALIESIN: Well, we've already killed two of them.

03:03:27.872 --> 03:03:29.701
SAM: She's definitely sick.

03:03:29.701 --> 03:03:31.853
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:03:31.853 --> 03:03:40.347
LAURA: That was cocked, unfortunately. That was a
good one. Oh, well. 16?

03:03:40.347 --> 03:03:45.736
MATT: 16? His face goes white and he goes, "Kill
the thing!" And rushes forward, blade held above.

03:03:45.736 --> 03:03:51.586
ASHLEY: I take out my greatsword.

03:03:51.586 --> 03:03:53.999
SAM: What, you're going to kill a guard?

03:03:53.999 --> 03:03:55.940
ASHLEY: Stop, stop.

03:03:55.940 --> 03:04:01.488
MATT: He holds back. He turns to you and sees you
standing a full four inches taller than him with a

03:04:01.488 --> 03:04:06.936
much larger blade, with one hand, and he goes,
"Look, if she's going to become one of these

03:04:06.936 --> 03:04:08.648
"things, we have to stop her now."

03:04:08.648 --> 03:04:12.069
LAURA: Yasha will totally kill me. Don't worry,
you can leave.

03:04:12.069 --> 03:04:18.619
MARISHA: Jester. Jokes are great until they get
you killed, man. She's joking.

03:04:18.619 --> 03:04:21.580
LAURA: (weak laughter)

03:04:21.580 --> 03:04:26.604
SAM: Poor guard.

03:04:26.604 --> 03:04:30.236
MATT: Immediately rubs his eyes. You can see him,
now that he's closer to you, you can see he's

03:04:30.236 --> 03:04:37.257
sweating, he's scared, he's generally trying the
best he can to use whatever training he's received

03:04:37.257 --> 03:04:39.079
to deal with a scenario he was not trained for.

03:04:39.079 --> 03:04:40.563
MARISHA: This is the King's Guard guy?

03:04:40.563 --> 03:04:45.464
MATT: One of the Crown's Guard. The Crown's Guard
are all generally hired and trained militia that

03:04:45.464 --> 03:04:47.146
are sent amongst all the cities to keep the
peace.

03:04:47.146 --> 03:04:49.374
MARISHA: What's your name, man?

03:04:49.374 --> 03:04:55.259
TALIESIN: Wow, he's really shook up.

03:04:55.259 --> 03:04:56.842
SAM: Jamieson.

03:04:56.842 --> 03:05:00.016
MATT: "Flynn."

03:05:00.016 --> 03:05:04.023
MARISHA: Flynn. How long you been doing this, you
said ten years?

03:05:04.023 --> 03:05:06.953
MATT: "Ten years two months ago."

03:05:06.953 --> 03:05:16.329
MARISHA: Oh. Happy ten year-i-versary. Yeah,
congrats. Did you get a nice watch or like a

03:05:16.329 --> 03:05:17.686
commemorative tankard?

03:05:17.686 --> 03:05:18.945
TRAVIS: They don't have watches yet.

03:05:18.945 --> 03:05:21.313
MARISHA: Shit. Did you get a commemorative
tankard? Forget the watch part.

03:05:21.313 --> 03:05:24.720
MATT: "No. Don't move."

03:05:24.720 --> 03:05:34.995
MARISHA: I'm not moving, man. Hey. Hey, Flynn.
Hey, man. How about first we put the swords down,

03:05:34.995 --> 03:05:38.266
because we helped? Yeah.

03:05:38.266 --> 03:05:44.788
SAM: Are any of us high charisma? 'Cause it don't
seem like it.

03:05:44.788 --> 03:05:48.755
MATT: At this point, the flaps at the front of the
tent, the entranceway, fold in and you watch as

03:05:48.755 --> 03:05:59.099
one, two, three, four, six, ten Crown's Guard
begin filtering into the chamber. You watch as one

03:05:59.099 --> 03:06:07.765
man, the one who has his helmet off and under his
shoulder, he's maybe in his early 40s or so, short

03:06:07.765 --> 03:06:13.449
brown hair with patches of grey. Somewhat
jaundiced skin. Molly, you've encountered this man

03:06:13.449 --> 03:06:18.860
once before when you entered the city. He
approaches Gustav right now with a commanding

03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:28.132
voice. "I had a gut feeling that you were nothing
but trouble when you came into our town." Gustav

03:06:28.132 --> 03:06:34.954
turns around. "I guarantee to you, my friend, I
have no idea--" "What happened here?" The Crown's

03:06:34.954 --> 03:06:43.351
Guard who's been shaken turns around and goes,
"Sir, Flynn. There was a creature. This carnival

03:06:43.351 --> 03:06:51.167
"seemed to create some sort of terrible entity that
killed and then created a secondary beast. I

03:06:51.167 --> 03:06:57.988
"watched it with my own eyes from the back row."
And the man turns back towards Gustav and the rest

03:06:57.988 --> 03:07:01.421
of you. "And who else saw that?"

03:07:01.421 --> 03:07:02.991
TRAVIS: We did.

03:07:02.991 --> 03:07:08.433
LAURA: Well, we saw an old guy turn into a zombie.
But it's possible that he just died because he was

03:07:08.433 --> 03:07:14.600
old, and then he had the zombie curse on him and
just turned, you know? Because that happens a lot.

03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:19.414
TALIESIN: (deadpan) Gustav, it's no use, we've
been found out. Our terrible plot to make a zombie

03:07:19.414 --> 03:07:23.920
rampage through our carnival has been discovered.
Whatever will we do now that we've been discovered

03:07:23.920 --> 03:07:28.723
for our brilliant plot to make a zombie ruin our
circus. My god.

03:07:28.723 --> 03:07:31.859
MATT: Flynn turns to you and goes, "Put your
weapons down or we'll arrest you immediately!"

03:07:31.859 --> 03:07:34.076
TALIESIN: I'm literally holding nothing but my
hands.

03:07:34.076 --> 03:07:37.867
LIAM: I mean, I'm sorry, but we're basically a
group of strangers. Most of us don't know each

03:07:37.867 --> 03:07:43.533
other. We all have the same story. There was a
show, an old man became a thing, and we helped

03:07:43.533 --> 03:07:46.777
destroy it. This one destroyed it. What more do
you want from us?

03:07:46.777 --> 03:07:48.293
TALIESIN: It ruined our show.

03:07:48.293 --> 03:07:54.675
MATT: Flynn turns back and says, "Watchmaster,
what should we do?" And the man with the helmet

03:07:54.675 --> 03:07:58.536
under his arm walks forward, walks to Gustav,
gives him one look over, still a few inches

03:07:58.536 --> 03:08:06.897
shorter than him. Looks at him with a sense of
purpose and social status that has a sense of

03:08:06.897 --> 03:08:19.739
disinterest and disrespect. "You, sir, and your
orc, and your circus, are considered currently

03:08:19.739 --> 03:08:29.629
"under arrest. Who else belongs to your merry
band?" He looks about the rest and Gustav goes,

03:08:29.629 --> 03:08:43.438
"The orc." Glances back at the two of you and
goes, "The rest of them are just purveyors of our

03:08:43.438 --> 03:08:50.445
"performances. He was just joking earlier, right?"
Make a deception check.

03:08:50.445 --> 03:08:52.954
SAM: Oh boy.

03:08:52.954 --> 03:08:57.317
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:08:57.317 --> 03:09:08.006
MATT: "And you are also under arrest. The rest of
you, what are your names?"

03:09:08.006 --> 03:09:09.921
LAURA: Shirley.

03:09:09.921 --> 03:09:11.802
SAM: Temple.

03:09:11.802 --> 03:09:14.964
(muffled laughter)

03:09:14.964 --> 03:09:17.476
LIAM: Caleb Widogast.

03:09:17.476 --> 03:09:21.704
MARISHA: Beau, same as him.

03:09:21.704 --> 03:09:23.272
TRAVIS: Bo.

03:09:23.272 --> 03:09:25.562
(laughter)

03:09:25.562 --> 03:09:27.160
SAM: I am Bo!

03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:31.292
TRAVIS: You pointed at me.

03:09:31.292 --> 03:09:34.906
MARISHA: I meant the NPC Bo! But it works!

03:09:34.906 --> 03:09:46.968
ASHLEY: Here's the thing. Oh, it's Mary by the
way, but I think I know who might know what has

03:09:46.968 --> 03:09:48.719
happened here.

03:09:48.719 --> 03:09:50.012
MATT: "Do you? Tell me."

03:09:50.012 --> 03:09:53.761
ASHLEY: I'll have to go get her.

03:09:53.761 --> 03:09:57.536
MATT: "Who is this?"

03:09:57.536 --> 03:10:01.943
ASHLEY: She is the singer that made this all
happen.

03:10:01.943 --> 03:10:11.269
MATT: "Flynn, escort this woman to retrieve this
individual she speaks of." Flynn nods and walks

03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:12.926
over towards you.

03:10:12.926 --> 03:10:18.488
LAURA: She's really shy, though, and I hear she
only talks to tieflings, so you should probably send--

03:10:18.488 --> 03:10:20.196
MATT: "Stay where you are."

03:10:20.196 --> 03:10:22.560
LAURA: --my brother along, because he's really good
with that stuff.

03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:27.708
TALIESIN: Try not to stab any random people on
your way there, Flynn. You're doing good.

03:10:27.708 --> 03:10:34.423
MATT: "My men tell me that the rest of you helped
destroy these fiends. Is that correct?"

03:10:34.423 --> 03:10:36.752
ALL: Yeah.

03:10:36.752 --> 03:10:41.911
MATT: "Then on behalf of the Starosta, I
appreciate your aid. But until this investigation

03:10:41.911 --> 03:10:48.162
"is complete, you are all under investigation from
us. Where are you staying?"

03:10:48.162 --> 03:10:51.286
TRAVIS: The Nestled Nook Inn.

03:10:51.286 --> 03:10:53.863
SAM: Nested Nook.

03:10:53.863 --> 03:10:57.362
MATT: Nestled. He got it right.

03:10:57.362 --> 03:11:00.630
SAM: Oh, shit. One letter. God damn it.

03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:03.321
TRAVIS: I have an intelligence of 14. I know what
I'm doing.

03:11:03.321 --> 03:11:14.637
MATT: "Do not leave this city unless you are told
otherwise. Should you do so, I have your names,

03:11:14.637 --> 03:11:22.906
"and I can have the full might of the Cerberus
Assembly track you down. You. Flynn. Free this

03:11:22.906 --> 03:11:28.247
"girl." While you all stand in the tent, Flynn
approaches you and walks a little bit behind you,

03:11:28.247 --> 03:11:34.956
weapon drawn but at the side. Do you lead him out
of the tent? Okay. So you walk through the

03:11:34.956 --> 03:11:42.802
performer's flap, and as you walk out, you can see
backed up into the number of tents that are set

03:11:42.802 --> 03:11:49.716
up, and some of the carts, other members of the
circus are hiding, and as soon as you exit out

03:11:49.716 --> 03:11:54.063
the front and they see you before the Crown's
Guard, they all immediately scatter and vanish to

03:11:54.063 --> 03:12:01.357
the nearby shadows, out of sight. The two of you
walk out into the center, the fire crackling in a

03:12:01.357 --> 03:12:07.088
small pit off to the side. "All right, where is
this girl you speak of?"

03:12:07.088 --> 03:12:09.720
ASHLEY: She's in the back in the tents.

03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:11.811
MATT: "Show me."

03:12:11.811 --> 03:12:13.907
ASHLEY: Follow me.

03:12:13.907 --> 03:12:19.989
MATT: He follows you. Which tent do you lead him
to? Over here? Okay, there's a larger tent, as he

03:12:19.989 --> 03:12:23.685
walks by your side, there's the flap that's
slightly open.

03:12:23.685 --> 03:12:25.630
SAM: God, you could seduce him.

03:12:25.630 --> 03:12:34.952
ASHLEY: Go get her. She won't talk to me. She's
too scared of me.

03:12:34.952 --> 03:12:40.568
MATT: "All right." Gets his weapon ready and walks
into the tent.

03:12:40.568 --> 03:12:43.466
ASHLEY: I close the tent and I take off.

03:12:43.466 --> 03:12:53.846
MATT: Okay. There's a few moments before, in the
distance, you hear a voice say, "The tent is

03:12:53.846 --> 03:13:02.426
"empty. What are you talking about? Hello?
Helloooo?"

03:13:02.426 --> 03:13:04.245
(laughter)

03:13:04.245 --> 03:13:08.890
MATT: And you don't look back, and you just run
into the darkness of night, into the Marrow Fields

03:13:08.890 --> 03:13:11.731
and disappear.

03:13:11.731 --> 03:13:13.983
SAM: But that's so mysterious.

03:13:13.983 --> 03:13:21.494
LIAM: While that was happening, I'm close to the
edge of the tent, and at some point I just (snap)

03:13:21.494 --> 03:13:30.026
and summoned Frumpkin. I have a 30-feet outside
the tent, so Frumpkin's out there.

03:13:30.026 --> 03:13:37.595
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin keeps watch. The Watchmaster,
as you heard him notified earlier, turns to the

03:13:37.595 --> 03:13:46.720
rest of you. "So. The investigation will begin. If
any information comes to light that could

03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:57.381
"alleviate you of the charges brought to this
carnival, come to me and let me know. If you have

03:13:57.381 --> 03:14:05.002
"no answers before we complete this investigation,
then I believe you all will fall into the judgment."

03:14:05.002 --> 03:14:11.028
LAURA: Next time we don't help. That's what it
comes down to.

03:14:11.028 --> 03:14:15.200
MARISHA: I know, we got paid the first time we
helped, and then we got arrested the second time.

03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:16.754
I don't know what lesson to learn here.

03:14:16.754 --> 03:14:18.268
SAM: Just say okay and let's leave.

03:14:18.268 --> 03:14:19.690
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

03:14:19.690 --> 03:14:27.071
MATT: So the guards escort you out of the tent.
Molly, you're stuck behind with Gustav and Bo the

03:14:27.123 --> 03:14:34.314
Breaker, with a guard of five Crown's Guards set
to keep watch. As the rest of you are sent to the

03:14:34.314 --> 03:14:43.126
city, the Watchmaster turns once more and says,
"Remember, you flee, I'll find you."

03:14:43.126 --> 03:14:45.926
And that's where we'll end tonight's session.

03:14:45.926 --> 03:14:49.239
SAM: No way! What? No! I want to keep playing.

03:14:49.239 --> 03:14:51.771
TALIESIN: I'm so excited, this is great.

03:14:51.771 --> 03:14:53.513
LIAM: It's a good spot.

03:14:53.513 --> 03:14:56.342
ASHLEY: We did it, we did it.

03:14:56.342 --> 03:14:58.405
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

03:14:58.405 --> 03:15:00.101
LAURA: We have to get Molly out!

03:15:00.101 --> 03:15:03.142
SAM: (sighs) Everything's better with Molly.

03:15:03.142 --> 03:15:07.525
(laughter)

03:15:07.525 --> 03:15:09.574
TALIESIN: Truer words were never spoken.

03:15:09.574 --> 03:15:16.123
MATT: Well, guys, welcome to the new campaign.
Season two, I guess.

03:15:16.123 --> 03:15:17.431
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

03:15:17.431 --> 03:15:19.768
MARISHA: It feels so weird.

03:15:19.768 --> 03:15:24.353
SAM: Look at these cool Wyrmwood cases that we
have!

03:15:24.353 --> 03:15:27.046
MATT: Fucking Sam. I swear to god.

03:15:27.046 --> 03:15:31.944
MARISHA: I used 100% new dice. No repeats from
Keyleth.

03:15:31.944 --> 03:15:33.703
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally new dice.

03:15:33.703 --> 03:15:35.449
TALIESIN: I kept the Gil die.

03:15:35.449 --> 03:15:37.065
LAURA: I used some new dice.

03:15:37.065 --> 03:15:38.646
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

03:15:38.646 --> 03:15:39.936
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;Some&lt;/i&gt; new dice.

03:15:39.936 --> 03:15:42.107
MATT: I used this beautiful little--

03:15:42.107 --> 03:15:44.429
TALIESIN: Fuck you.

03:15:44.429 --> 03:15:46.620
MATT: The Snitch is mine now.

03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:48.926
LIAM: Look at all the 20s Taliesin rolled
tonight.

03:15:48.984 --> 03:15:57.226
MATT: I know. Oh man. I'm excited.

03:15:57.226 --> 03:15:59.257
SAM: Such cool characters, guys!

03:15:59.257 --> 03:16:00.956
MATT: I'm excited to see where this goes.

03:16:00.956 --> 03:16:06.593
SAM: I still don't know what half of you guys are.
What's Travis?

03:16:06.593 --> 03:16:09.528
MATT: Everyone did something that revealed them
tonight.

03:16:09.528 --> 03:16:12.464
SAM: I don't know nothing, I don't know how to
play D&amp;D.

03:16:12.464 --> 03:16:14.869
MARISHA: Should we all say in case you're Sam and
you don't know?

03:16:14.869 --> 03:16:16.313
TRAVIS: I'm a ballerina.

03:16:16.313 --> 03:16:17.814
MARISHA: He's a prima.

03:16:17.814 --> 03:16:25.678
MATT: Well, guys. Happy New Year. Welcome back,
Happy New Year to you guys. Thank you for coming

03:16:25.678 --> 03:16:30.645
along with us on this first episode of a new
journey. Thank you, Backblaze and DnD Beyond, for

03:16:30.645 --> 03:16:36.419
being awesome sponsors partnered with us going
forward. Thank you, Wyrmwood, for this amazing

03:16:36.419 --> 03:16:43.323
table. Thank you guys for coming along with us
this evening for our first dive into this new

03:16:43.323 --> 03:16:46.280
venture. Hope you enjoyed it. We did.

03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:48.283
MARISHA: Thank you to our amazing crew.

03:16:48.283 --> 03:16:53.472
SAM: Thank you, Matt Mercer, for this amazing new
campaign! Welcome to Wildemount.

03:16:53.472 --> 03:16:54.946
MATT: I'm excited.

03:16:54.946 --> 03:16:57.751
SAM: Thanks, Yev.

03:16:57.751 --> 03:17:07.588
MATT: Guys, have a wonderful evening. We'll see
you next week. See where this next stage in the

03:17:07.588 --> 03:17:10.016
story takes us. Ashley, I'm glad you could make it
for this first episode.

03:17:10.016 --> 03:17:12.330
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.

03:17:12.330 --> 03:17:18.158
MATT: Until then, have a wonderful night, sleep
well, and is it Thursday yet? Good night!

03:17:18.158 --> 03:17:20.887
(cheering)

03:17:20.887 --> 03:24:31.832

BRIAN: (singing) Where can I find a girl like
that? Oh god. Well, what do you guys think?

00:00:48.053 --> 00:01:01.365
Taliesin did a pretty great job, right? Do you
like the Crocs? Thank you. He told me a couple

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:04.588
weeks ago, he said, "What kind of look do you want
to go for?" and I said, "Do you have anything

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:14.106
"that's a good mix between Colonel Sanders and
Liberace?" I think we got there! Right before I

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:22.575
walked out, our producer Max whispered to me, he
said, "You look like a pimp from Atlantis." In all

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:29.379
seriousness, though, I told Taliesin, I said,
"Just give me the gay televangelist." Then I

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:32.038
realized that that's a little bit redundant.

00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:42.822
[laughter, cheering]

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:49.629
BRIAN: Welcome, my friends, in this room and
online, to Critical Role Live at Gen Con 2018!

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:56.909
[cheering]

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.299
BRIAN: If you're at the con this weekend, please
stop by our booth, number 2931, The Invulnerable

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.334
Vagrant. Give it up for all of our crew who did a
great job putting that together. It's so rad.

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:11.782
[cheering]

00:02:11.782 --> 00:02:17.161
BRIAN: A couple quick housekeeping things before
we get going, real fast. We're going to have a

00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:22.887
break, just like every episode of Critical Role,
so try to stay in your seats if you can until the

00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:26.674
break and then you can go to the bathroom, get
merch, whatever. If you guys were here last year,

00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:31.786
and those of you watching at home, you remember
that when someone stands up, the chair sounds like

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:39.282
someone's waterboarding a pterodactyl. If we could
keep that to a minimum. What's that? Nobody cares.

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:45.303
Hold on. We're moving on. No, I'm just kidding.
Speaking of, during the episode tonight, you guys

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:52.325
can laugh, scream, cheer, cry, gasp, any of that
stuff. The only thing that we ask is that you

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:58.392
don't shout any rules or corrections at Matt or
the players. The only reason why we ask that, you

00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:00.945
guys, is because it's fucking annoying.

[cheering]

00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:16.743
BRIAN: Let's keep those to a minimum of zero. As
I'm sure many of you guys know, today, August 3rd,

00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:19.944
is our beloved Travis Willingham's birthday.

00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:24.964
[cheering]

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:29.015
BRIAN: He couldn't make it. Him and Laura couldn't
make it this year, but for the best reasons

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:36.626
possible, because they just had a beautiful little
baby boy, Ronin. I know. He's such a buddy! I

00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:41.309
thought maybe we could Facetime him and sing Happy
Birthday. Is anybody interested in that?

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:48.501
[cheering]

00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:51.817
BRIAN: All right, we're dialing. Oh my goodness!

[cheering]

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:18.448
BRIAN: Look at that. Hey guys! Look at the baby!
Hey, we love you. Can you hear us?

00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:21.640
LAURA and TRAVIS: We love you guys!

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.120
BRIAN: What are you guys doing? I was hoping we
weren't going to catch Travis in the midst of

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.775
breastfeeding. How are you guys doing? Do you miss
us?

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:30.205
TRAVIS: So much!

00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:31.847
LAURA: We miss you so much!

00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:36.224
BRIAN: We miss you too, we wish you were here. We
have a little present for you. You guys ready?

00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:38.074
One, two, three.

00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:50.957
AUDIENCE and BRIAN: (singing) Happy birthday to
you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:59.708
Travis! Happy birthday to you!

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:00.892

TRAVIS: Oh my god, you guys are amazing. I only
have one request.

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:11.629
BRIAN: Hit me.

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.645
TRAVIS: Mighty Nein, I want you to kick some
fucking ass!

00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:16.894
BRIAN: Yeah!

BRIAN: You'll be watching along? Okay, good.

00:05:26.323 --> 00:05:29.923
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll be watching. We earmuffed
Ronin for that, right?

00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:32.854
LAURA: Totally. No cussing. Don't talk about them
titties.

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:37.035
BRIAN: We love you guys!

00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:38.541
TRAVIS: Love you guys!

00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:45.953
BRIAN: Miss you. Say goodbye to Travis and Laura.
Oh man, I wish those guys could have been here

00:05:45.953 --> 00:05:52.145
this year, but instead they brought me for some
stupid reason. What do you say we get this party

00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:53.538
started, you guys?

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:22.352

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:15.245
MATT: Wow. Holy shit, y'all! Welcome to the poor
unfortunate soul that had to follow Sam Riegel out

00:09:15.293 --> 00:09:25.696
on stage. (shouting) No, don't touch it! We all
know where it's been!

LIAM: (shouting) Marion! Don't look, Marion!

audience here and many of you wonderful people

back at home watching us. So welcome, glad you
could join us. Oh man, butterflies in my tummy.

00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:08.885
This is an incredible energy. Anyway--

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:29.475
MATT: Anyway, enough of that. Thank you guys so
much for joining us. Before we get into the show,

00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:32.446
welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

[cheering]

00:10:38.153 --> 00:10:44.694
MATT: We have some announcements to go through.
First, we have our fantastic returning sponsor,

00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:47.228
our wonderful friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:10:47.228 --> 00:10:52.610

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.763
MATT: Sam, if you don't mind.

00:10:53.763 --> 00:10:56.754
SAM: D&amp;amp;D Beyond did not want me to sing a song, so
I have one.

00:10:56.754 --> 00:11:00.271
[laughter]

00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.503
SAM: I'll try to get through it quick because we
have so much to do. (singing) D&amp;amp;D Beyond's our

00:11:04.503 --> 00:11:11.412
sponsor today. They got a lot of things they want
me to say, like the discount code for new editions

00:11:11.412 --> 00:11:17.515
and their booth outside at intermission. But I'm
sorry, I'm not saying those things, because when

00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:23.927
I'm inspired I just got to sing. I'm in a
ridiculous pink frock and 2,600 Critters are ready

00:11:23.927 --> 00:11:25.056
to rock!

00:11:25.056 --> 00:11:27.801
[cheering]

00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:34.851
SAM: (singing) At Gen Con, I'm surrounded by my
friends-con, Ashly, Marisha, Matt, Taliesin-con.

00:11:34.851 --> 00:11:40.924
They'll be by my side 'til the end-con! At Gen
Con. (spoken) There's a second verse; I'll go

00:11:40.924 --> 00:11:49.666
through it fast. D&amp;amp;D Beyond might drop us tonight,
because what I'm doing here, it just ain't right.

00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:55.103
I'm not advertising their Facebook page, or
telling you the promo code GENCON2018 is what it

00:11:55.103 --> 00:12:03.173
is like I promised backstage. But this little
stud's got to follow his heart. And maybe some

00:12:03.173 --> 00:12:10.945
other body parts. So if they'd want to know who to
blame, why don't you just tell them by shouting my name?

00:12:10.945 --> 00:12:14.269
AUDIENCE: Sam Riegel!

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:21.909
SAM: (singing) At Gen Con, I'm not even going to
pretend-con. My outfit definitely offends-con. You

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:26.855
can all see my rear end-con. At Gen Con. Thank
you!

[cheering]

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:41.091
SAM: But seriously, they are giving away a
Legendary Bundle on their Facebook page, and

00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:46.805
they're offering up a special discount code,
GENCON2018, for 25% off any digital products.

00:12:46.805 --> 00:12:48.461
Okay, I'm done!

00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:55.411
MATT: Thank you, Sam. And thank you, our friends
at D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Few other quick announcements to

00:12:55.411 --> 00:13:00.708
get through. My fireside chat that was part of our
fantastic 826LA charity run we did a couple months

00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:06.130
back will be this coming Tuesday, August 7th, at
5:00pm Pacific, where I'll be answering a bunch of

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.146
your questions and generally hanging out with the
community for about an hour or more. So hope to

00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:14.561
have you there. We'll have Marisha's Honey Heist
2: Electric Beargaloo--

00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:24.770
MATT: Will be this coming Friday after this,
August 10th, at 7:00pm Pacific. You can watch both

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:31.295
of these streams at twitch.tv/criticalrole and if
you miss the livestream, they'll be available on

00:13:31.295 --> 00:13:36.898
our YouTube a few days after the stream, so look
for that. For more details and a link to the NPC

00:13:36.898 --> 00:13:41.517
survey-- a lot of the people in the community have
been helping us forge this community-made NPC that

00:13:41.517 --> 00:13:46.640
will end up becoming part of the world that we
run-- go to critrole.com. Another huge

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.537
announcement that has taken a lot of blood, sweat,
and tears from this wonderful man, Taliesin, here,

00:13:52.537 --> 00:13:59.389
and this wonderful man, Liam O'Brien, over here.
We're excited to announce our coming sequel to our

00:13:59.389 --> 00:14:01.395
art book, The Chronicles of Exandria.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:23.749
MATT: This one bookends the second and final half
of the Vox Machina adventure, featuring all

00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:28.956
community-based art from all the incredible
Critters out there. Taliesin, Liam, what do you

00:14:28.956 --> 00:14:30.667
have to say?

00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:34.398
LIAM: (as Caleb) Well, if you were wondering why
Taliesin was losing his-- (as Liam) Oh, I'm doing

00:14:34.398 --> 00:14:42.340
Caleb already. Taliesin was losing his mind the
last several weeks while also dying. I quietly

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:48.499
lost my mind at nights out in the National Parks, it's
because we've been working on this.

00:14:48.499 --> 00:14:52.557
TALIESIN: That was the one thing I couldn't say on
Talks was my first thought when Molly died was: I

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:58.414
just lost three days off of my artbook schedule,
oh god! Oh no! Please no!

00:14:58.414 --> 00:15:05.161
LIAM: It's shaping up beautifully, it's full of
beautiful pieces from the community that you are

00:15:05.161 --> 00:15:10.554
probably familiar with. There's some that are new
to the book, and we're very proud of-- oh, it's

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:16.232
gone-- the cover, which is done by comic artist
Matteo Scalera. You might know him from the comic

00:15:16.232 --> 00:15:23.362
Black Science. I've loved his art for a while. The
cover's gorgeous. Moreno Dinisio, who does his

00:15:23.362 --> 00:15:28.495
coloring on Black Science, did it for the cover as
well. The book looks amazing, and, for the

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:32.876
thousandth time, thank you for every artist in this
community who gives back to the show.

00:15:45.088 --> 00:15:49.918
MATT: For more details on that as we are able to
share them going on forward, including on-sale

00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:56.026
updates, go to critrole.com to keep up to speed
on that. As a reminder, we have our Wyrmwood

00:15:56.039 --> 00:16:00.565
giveaways that we do during the breaks here for
the Critical Role intermission. We'll be having

00:16:00.565 --> 00:16:04.559
one here tonight as well. So when we go to break,
you'll have to jump over to the Critical Role

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:09.570
Twitch chat, that's twitch.tv/criticalrole, we'll
have a code at the time for you to enter, but be

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:15.942
prepared for when that comes around. Let's see, I
think that brings us mostly to the end of our

00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:19.572
announcements for the evening. It's time to get
comfortable.

00:16:19.572 --> 00:16:26.332

Wait, what? (shouting, extended) No!

MATT: Maybe.

00:17:04.278 --> 00:17:07.908
SAM: That's a handsome shirt.

00:17:07.908 --> 00:17:16.157
MATT: Couldn't agree more. With all that out of
the way, as we rein in--

SAM: Mercer!

00:17:17.502 --> 00:17:23.799
MATT: --our respective nerves and ridiculousness,
I think it's time for us to come into tonight's

Perfect. The Mighty Nein, an intrepid band of
adventurers here in the continent of Wildemount,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.480
had found three of their members taken in the
middle of the night by a band of kidnappers and

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.171
slavers they found to be called The Iron
Shepherds. In trying to hunt down and find where

00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:27.886
their allies were taken, they ran into a previous
member of this team, known as Keg, a dwarven

00:19:27.886 --> 00:19:32.579
warrior who herself was on a path to vengeance
against these people she previously worked with.

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:38.119
Aligning forces, they made their way northward,
towards the city of Shadycreek Run, which exists

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:43.065
outside of the laws and boundaries of the
Dwendalian Empire. Along the way, they ambushed

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:50.312
The Iron Shepherds, and in doing so lost one of
their allies. With Mollymauk fallen on the

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:55.527
battlefield and the rest left to simmer over the
decisions they made, they continued northward,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:02.882
where they encountered a new friend, north of the
city of Shadycreek Run. Caduceus Clay was pulled

00:20:02.882 --> 00:20:11.525
from his hermit lifestyle north of the city within
the confines of the Savalierwood to join them in

00:20:11.525 --> 00:20:19.788
assaulting The Sour Nest, the keep where the Iron
Shepherds call home. They staked out the outskirts

00:20:19.788 --> 00:20:25.866
of this location, managed to slay some of the
guardians who were keeping watch along the outer

00:20:25.866 --> 00:20:34.103
perimeter wall, not necessarily very stealthily
made their way into the entryway, but managed to

00:20:34.103 --> 00:20:40.898
take out a number of members of the Iron
Shepherds, some of their paid compatriots, as well

00:20:40.898 --> 00:20:46.695
as some of their more elite, at least one of their
more elite, fighters. Along with them they had met

00:20:46.695 --> 00:20:56.071
Nila, who is a firbolg who was searching for her also
kidnapped partner and son. Using her druidic

00:20:56.133 --> 00:21:02.902
powers, aided them in this assault, and in doing
so found and helped her family escape. As she

00:21:02.902 --> 00:21:07.993
absconded from the location with her family to
keep them safe, the rest of you remained behind,

00:21:07.993 --> 00:21:14.660
trying to find out where the remainder of The Iron
Shepherds reside within The Sour Nest and how best

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:23.416
to deal with their presence. Last we left off,
Caleb, you had sent Frumpkin, your familiar, in

00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:32.019
the form of a spider, to inspect the upper floor
of the chamber, and upon feeling a squeeze from

00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:38.870
Keg, had just instilled her with the speed and
alacrity of a Haste spell. And that's where we're

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:49.062
going to pick up. In this moment, Keg, as you go
to notify Caleb of what has transpired below, he

00:21:49.062 --> 00:21:54.566
reaches out and instills you with that familiar
surge of adrenaline. Time seems to slow, your

00:21:54.566 --> 00:21:58.471
muscles tense and flex. What do you do?

00:21:58.471 --> 00:22:04.289
LIAM: I can't hear you, but we don't have much
time, so let's move forward carefully, please, and

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:08.402
it's just the two of us so, you know, help me out,
will you?

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:11.410
ASHLY: Yeah. Where's Frumpkin right now?

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:19.062
LIAM: Further up. He's made it to the second floor,
I think. I didn't pop out, so I'm seeing what

00:22:19.062 --> 00:22:21.217
Frumpkin sees at this point.

00:22:21.217 --> 00:22:22.708
MATT: He's a slow spider.

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:25.004
ASHLY: Shit. Is he one minute slow?

00:22:25.004 --> 00:22:26.336
MATT: Yeah.

00:22:26.336 --> 00:22:32.010
ASHLY: (groans) I kind of want to-- no, I
shouldn't-- just barrel ahead.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.814
LIAM: I can't hear a thing she's saying.

00:22:33.814 --> 00:22:38.955
MATT: Frumpkin has curled his way to the top floor
and you can see there are the two open hallways

00:22:38.955 --> 00:22:52.585
here from left to right. Frumpkin would be-- I got
two mics to make this work! Frumpkin appears on

00:22:52.585 --> 00:22:57.601
the secondary floor looking down both hallways in
which there appear to be no signs of anyone at the

00:22:57.601 --> 00:22:58.717
moment.

00:22:58.717 --> 00:23:06.018
MARISHA: I love the cheers for foresight. They're
like, "Yeah, two mics! Yes! Get it, production team!"

00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:09.525
MATT: Your Haste is running out.

00:23:09.525 --> 00:23:16.709
ASHLY: I'm so not stealthy. Unless I go
downstairs, I just got to waste the Haste.

00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:20.623
LIAM: Well, they told us that they would wait for
us before going down and I'm sure that they have

00:23:20.623 --> 00:23:21.938
done that.

00:23:21.938 --> 00:23:25.771
[laughter]

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:30.731
LIAM: Oh, but I can't hear you. Looking through
Frumpkin's eyes, there's no time to waste. I've

00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:35.430
Hasted her to protect me since it's just the two
of us, but I have to move upstairs. So I'm going

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.040
to feel my way up the stairs and hope that Keg
comes along.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:45.136
MATT: Caleb begins to slowly climb up the stairs,
feeling out along these spirals as it carries from

00:23:45.136 --> 00:23:47.737
the bottom floor to the upper tier of The Sour
Nest fortress.

00:23:47.737 --> 00:23:50.275
LIAM: While I ask Frumpkin to continue along the
right path.

00:23:50.275 --> 00:23:52.898
ASHLY: Do I need to make a stealth check?

00:23:52.898 --> 00:23:56.738
MATT: You would if you want to stay quiet, yes.
With disadvantage.

00:23:56.738 --> 00:24:08.166
ASHLY: All right, let's do it. Four. That's going
to go ahead and-- yeah, it's four. A nine?

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:12.090
ASHLY, MATT, and AUDIENCE: Nein

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:23.091
MATT: As Caleb begins to fumble his way up the
stairs, Keg coasts up past him, double Haste speed,

00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:28.829
clanging all the way. Frumpkin can hear this from
the top floor. You hear this heavy sound of like

00:24:28.829 --> 00:24:34.316
two giant bags of pots and pans. (clanking) You
make your way to the top.

00:24:34.316 --> 00:24:39.441
LIAM: And this is where the plan falls apart.

00:24:39.441 --> 00:24:44.618
MATT: Keg, you have about two more rounds before
your Haste runs out. You now see both sides of

00:24:44.618 --> 00:24:48.129
this hallway are open and empty. They both curl
around the corner to show the perimeter and there

00:24:48.129 --> 00:24:52.102
are rooms in the interior. You see one doorway
right across from where you entered.

00:24:52.102 --> 00:24:53.996
ASHLY: How far is Caleb behind me?

00:24:53.996 --> 00:24:57.883
MATT: Caleb's about 15 feet below.

00:24:57.883 --> 00:24:59.767
ASHLY: So you're not coming up.

00:24:59.767 --> 00:25:05.054
LIAM: I am processing right now. I haven't made a
decision in a split-second.

00:25:05.054 --> 00:25:10.343
ASHLY: (laughter) I'm going to hold. I'm not going
to keep going forward.

00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:18.452
MATT: In waiting for Caleb to ascend the stairs,
the Haste spell comes to a complete cycle. Your

00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:23.824
body is filled with lethargic energy drain and
you find yourself stunned there for a moment at

00:25:23.824 --> 00:25:28.371
the top of the stairs as the spell fades. But
Caleb has joined you.

00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:31.209
LIAM: Okay, that could have gone better.

00:25:31.209 --> 00:25:34.696
ASHLY: Sorry. I misunderstood.

00:25:34.696 --> 00:25:41.665
LIAM: No, no, no. Let's wait here for a second.
Frumpkin, my boy, will you please go ahead?

00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:45.499
ASHLY: Oh, there it is.

00:25:45.499 --> 00:25:58.367
LIAM: I will gently pull Keg around the corner of
the left path, five feet, so we are not in direct view.

00:25:58.367 --> 00:25:59.901
MATT: This path here?

00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:03.941
LIAM: Well, if Frumpkin's going this way, I will
move Keg and I a little bit that way so we are not

00:26:03.941 --> 00:26:05.106
in direct view.

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:08.594
MATT: The two of you begin to move slowly in this
direction as Frumpkin slowly curls, in spider

00:26:08.594 --> 00:26:16.522
speed, further down this edge. There is a closed
doorway here and it curves around this side. Do

00:26:16.522 --> 00:26:19.421
you continue? There's a door right there.

00:26:19.421 --> 00:26:22.453
LIAM: I will let Frumpkin continue and watch.

00:26:22.453 --> 00:26:28.119
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin continues down, eventually
revealing the back hallway to be also empty.

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:31.892
There's nobody inside that hall at the moment, but
you see a second doorway right at the back there.

00:26:31.892 --> 00:26:35.613
It seems there is either a linked chamber or two
different rooms that have entryways right there.

00:26:35.613 --> 00:26:44.507
LIAM: What are we doing? Let's have Frumpkin look
under that door that was just revealed.

00:26:44.507 --> 00:26:54.732
MATT: Frumpkin peeks under the door, and unveils
some sort of a rest chamber for a number of

00:26:54.732 --> 00:27:08.394
hirelings. You do see inside, currently, two
sleeping hired members who have begun waking up

00:27:08.394 --> 00:27:13.297
from the recent sounds to go through their stuff.

00:27:13.297 --> 00:27:18.489
SAM: Matt, do they have matching Huey, Dewey, and
Louie themed bed sheets?

00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:21.825
(laughter)

00:27:21.825 --> 00:27:33.502
MATT: It's what they could find on Amazon. So yes,
they do. They both, seemingly alarmed by the

00:27:33.502 --> 00:27:37.984
recent sounds of both the fireworks outside and
the commotion downstairs--

00:27:37.984 --> 00:27:40.650
ASHLY: It was the fireworks, too. It wasn't just
me. Okay, great.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.225
MATT: They're going into these chests and pulling
out their armor and they're in the process of

00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:46.915
putting on the leather armor. They're getting
ready to scramble downward.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.202
LIAM: They're preoccupied?

00:27:48.202 --> 00:27:49.420
MATT: At the moment, yes.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:28:00.078
LIAM: I come out of Frumpkin's vision and I take
Caleb-- Caleb is me. I take Keg by the hand and go

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:05.084
close to her ear and whisper and say: Just follow
me, please.

00:28:05.084 --> 00:28:06.863
ASHLY: You got it.

00:28:06.863 --> 00:28:13.899
LIAM: And tell Frumpkin to go up that side and we
will go up the other side.

00:28:13.899 --> 00:28:16.451
ASHLY: Do I need to roll again?

00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:20.397
LIAM: Frumpkin can get there just ahead of me and
peek around that corner before we turn it.

00:28:20.397 --> 00:28:24.958
MATT: All right, Frumpkin continues down this
hall.

00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:28.207
LIAM: We scooch to the corner.

00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:31.507
MATT: You guys reach the corner as well and as you
spin around the edge, you can see there are two

00:28:31.507 --> 00:28:35.457
doors that lead to two other chambers that are
separated on the opposite end.

00:28:35.457 --> 00:28:43.549
LIAM: Okay. Rinse, repeat. I send Fumpkin under
the first door, pull Keg a little bit further so

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:45.733
we are by those doors.

00:28:45.733 --> 00:28:54.484
MATT: As you go near the first door, Frumpkin
enters this chamber, which reveals another shared

00:28:54.484 --> 00:29:03.005
bedchamber. Maybe more elite members of the Iron
Shepherds call a room to bed for the evening. As

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:11.503
Frumpkin enters this space, you hear the far door
open up on that side. Footsteps, as the now donned

00:29:11.503 --> 00:29:18.446
armor and armed hirees of the Iron Shepherds begin to
make their way down the stairs below.

00:29:18.446 --> 00:29:27.730
LIAM: I pull out the copper wire, listening, and I
aim down, looking for Nott, and say: there are two

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.565
coming from the upper floor. I don't know if
they're leaving or coming away, but be alert.

00:29:31.565 --> 00:29:45.095
SAM: Ah! There's two coming, Caleb just-- oh wait,
I got it! Caleb just warned me there's two men

00:29:45.095 --> 00:29:48.912
coming down the stairs to us.

00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:50.757
MARISHA: Do they look like Iron Shepherds?

00:29:50.757 --> 00:29:52.754
SAM: Let me get out my copper wire.

00:29:52.754 --> 00:29:59.918
MARISHA: No, don't worry about it, it's fine. You
want to flank the door with me? You're not with

00:29:59.918 --> 00:30:01.479
me. You want to flank the door with me?

00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:03.285
SAM: It's just us and Mr. Clay.

00:30:03.285 --> 00:30:07.043
TALIESIN: I'll be the first to greet him. It
should be fine.

00:30:07.244 --> 00:30:09.070
SAM: Wait, you guys are dressed like guards
still.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.442
TALIESIN: I still look like a guard.

00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:15.983
MARISHA: We are dressed like guards. Where are we?
Are we on the outside of the cellar or are we down?

00:30:15.983 --> 00:30:19.690
MATT: You guys are down in the basement still,
after you sent Nila up with her family to exit.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.513
MARISHA: Where's the body of the other guard we
killed?

00:30:23.513 --> 00:30:24.913
SAM: Ooh.

00:30:24.913 --> 00:30:27.203
MATT: Up near the hatch on the upper stairs.

00:30:27.203 --> 00:30:28.801
MARISHA: Is he just chilling?

00:30:28.801 --> 00:30:32.346
MATT: You didn't put it anywhere else, so yeah,
just sitting up against a wall.

00:30:32.346 --> 00:30:36.387
TALIESIN: It's definitely, probably starting to
turn a little weird.

00:30:36.387 --> 00:30:40.048
MATT: It is a little bit. It takes a while for the
decomposition to take effect.

00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:42.065
MARISHA: We just killed him, man.

00:30:42.065 --> 00:30:44.025
TALIESIN: Let's head upstairs and take care of
this.

00:30:44.025 --> 00:30:50.618
MARISHA: Okay, so we'll go up into the cellar and
I'm going to open the hatch and say: Help me out.

00:30:50.618 --> 00:30:54.134
And shove the guard's--

00:30:54.134 --> 00:30:55.964
SAM: Down the stairs?

00:30:55.964 --> 00:30:59.033
MARISHA: Nott, let's put him in the cage and maybe
he'll--

00:30:59.033 --> 00:31:03.093
TALIESIN: I think you're overplanning. Let's just
go upstairs, we'll tell them everything's fine,

00:31:03.093 --> 00:31:05.503
and then we can kill the two of them. It should be
fine.

00:31:05.503 --> 00:31:10.638
[laughter]

00:31:10.638 --> 00:31:14.310
ASHLY: Matt, are we in-- are they going to pass us
on the way out?

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.441
LIAM: No, the stairs were down in the corner
closest to us.

00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:19.727
MATT: The stairs to go down are right there.
That's the one exit you have.

00:31:19.727 --> 00:31:23.383
LIAM: I will say in the meantime that I would, of
course, have sent Frumpkin into the final room to

00:31:23.383 --> 00:31:25.932
know if we have cleared this place up here.

00:31:25.932 --> 00:31:31.766
MATT: As Frumpkin enters the final room, it
reveals a large bedchamber adorned with more

00:31:31.766 --> 00:31:39.172
intricate silks and accoutrement, to design a
garish but somewhat ghastly bedroom in dark reds

00:31:39.172 --> 00:31:48.643
and purples. You can see, on the side of the bed,
a plate that still contains mostly eaten remains

00:31:48.643 --> 00:31:56.225
of some sort of creature. The room smells of a
musty smoke and some thick animalistic musk. It's

00:31:56.225 --> 00:32:02.298
hard to pinpoint, but it's a putrid stench
immediately once it hits Frumpkin's nose. But the

00:32:02.298 --> 00:32:03.737
room is empty.

00:32:03.737 --> 00:32:05.921
ASHLY: Okay.

00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:08.294
LIAM: Quickly, do I see anything of note in this
room?

00:32:08.294 --> 00:32:10.339
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:32:10.339 --> 00:32:15.158
MARISHA: You know Caduceus, I think there's
actually merit to your plan. I'm kind of into it.

00:32:15.158 --> 00:32:16.598
LIAM: 17.

00:32:16.598 --> 00:32:20.060
TALIESIN: Two escaped prisoners, one got them out.
Damn shame.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.107
MARISHA: Damn shame.

00:32:21.107 --> 00:32:23.609
TALISIN: Yeah. Right.

00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:28.696
SAM: I'm not following, what are we doing? Am I an
escaped prisoner?

00:32:28.696 --> 00:32:35.025
TALIESIN: No, we got an-- you really not
following? I felt like that was really clear.

00:32:35.025 --> 00:32:42.014
MARISHA: Just stay here in case-- when Caleb and
Keg get back.

00:32:42.014 --> 00:32:44.454
SAM: You're going to go attack these people
with--?

00:32:44.454 --> 00:32:47.345
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can get them to
leave the house and if they don't leave the house,

00:32:47.345 --> 00:32:51.180
then I think you should probably shoot them with
that thing.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.290
MARISHA: We're going to have them chase the
escaped prisoners.

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.581
SAM: All right. Sounds good.

00:32:55.581 --> 00:32:59.262
MATT: As this is transpiring, what did you roll
for a perception check?

00:32:59.262 --> 00:33:00.122
LIAM: 17.

00:33:00.122 --> 00:33:07.725
MATT: There doesn't look to be anything about the
stonework or beneath the bed at Frumpkin's level

00:33:07.725 --> 00:33:11.720
that looks out of the ordinary. Frumpkin briefly
leaps up onto the edge of the bed and you can see

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.180
the bed, while it was once well made, seems to
have been worn-- the actual cushion is sagged

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.338
pretty heavy in the center-- it looks like it's
been slept in for quite some time.

00:33:20.338 --> 00:33:25.464
LIAM: Okay. Well, if we are still alive in an
hour, there will be time for this later. I leave

00:33:25.464 --> 00:33:34.181
it. Listen, you're not going to see me for a
while, but I will be with you.

00:33:34.181 --> 00:33:38.868
ASHLY: What do you mean? You'll leave me alone!?

00:33:38.868 --> 00:33:39.944
LIAM: No, I am not--

00:33:39.944 --> 00:33:41.514
ASHLY: I'm canonically a coward!

00:33:41.514 --> 00:33:48.356
[laughter]

00:33:48.356 --> 00:34:00.408
LIAM: Yeah, ditto kiddo. It galls me to do this
because I will only be able to do it the one time.

00:34:00.408 --> 00:34:12.941
Fuck it. I pull out the scroll of invisibility
that Calianna gave me and recite a few words and I am gone.

00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:15.359
ASHLY: What the fuck?

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.766
LIAM: Then you feel a tap-tap-tap on your
shoulder.

00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:19.897
ASHLY: What the fuck?

00:34:19.897 --> 00:34:22.153
MARISHA: Keg doesn't have object permanence.

00:34:22.153 --> 00:34:28.701
[laughter]

00:34:28.721 --> 00:34:38.634
ASHLY: That is now also canon. Write that in your
Wikipedias. Okay, I guess I'll go back down to

00:34:38.634 --> 00:34:40.513
everyone else?

00:34:40.513 --> 00:34:48.540
LIAM: Quietly please and I will not be walking
right next to you, but a little ways away. You can

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.854
trust me; I will not leave your side.

00:34:51.854 --> 00:34:52.922
ASHLY: Okay.

00:34:52.922 --> 00:34:53.867
LIAM: Carefully.

00:34:53.867 --> 00:34:57.649
ASHLY: If you can tap me every so often to remind
me of that, that would be great.

00:34:57.649 --> 00:35:03.319
LIAM: Oh, one other thing-- and there's a little
flash on your shoulder and there is a large-ish spider.

00:35:03.611 --> 00:35:05.480
ASHLY: (high-pitched) What the fuck!?

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.534
[laughter]

00:35:08.534 --> 00:35:11.754
LIAM: A little quieter than that, please.

00:35:11.754 --> 00:35:15.217
ASHLY: (whispers) What the fuck?

00:35:15.217 --> 00:35:17.943
LIAM: That's the ticket. Let's go.

00:35:17.943 --> 00:35:21.601
ASHLY: Okay, must I roll again? For stealth?

00:35:21.601 --> 00:35:23.507
MATT: For stealth? Yeah. Still with disadvantage.

00:35:23.507 --> 00:35:24.955
ASHLY: Give me some good juju guys.

00:35:24.955 --> 00:35:26.677
[cheering]

00:35:26.677 --> 00:35:32.272
ASHLY: It didn't work. It's a ten.

00:35:32.272 --> 00:35:34.341
SAM: That's double digits!

00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:35.576
TALIESIN: It's a number.

00:35:35.576 --> 00:35:39.999
MATT: Better than last time. By one.

00:35:39.999 --> 00:35:43.674
SAM: The audience's support counts for one.

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:45.243
ASHLY: All these people.

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:51.300
MATT: It's a scale in the right direction. So Keg,
as you hold up your plates a bit, like you're

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:57.294
trying to cross a puddle, you're trying to tiptoe
down the stone hallway towards the staircase. The

00:35:57.294 --> 00:36:03.850
rest of you begin to hear what sounds like the
arrival of footsteps rushing along the stone on

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.718
the outside of the small hallway that leads to the
trapdoor into the basement. What do you do?

00:36:07.718 --> 00:36:15.864
TALIESIN: I'm going to position myself in the
corner between that-- hunch against the wall, try

00:36:15.864 --> 00:36:20.602
and lose my breath if that makes sense.

00:36:20.602 --> 00:36:27.597
MARISHA: I'm going to face away since I don't have
the disguise spell and look really perturbed

00:36:27.597 --> 00:36:31.662
towards the prison.

00:36:31.662 --> 00:36:34.918
SAM: Matt, are they in the little hall just
outside the--

00:36:34.918 --> 00:36:39.936
MATT: Yeah, it's maybe a 15-foot wide hallway.

00:36:39.936 --> 00:36:46.800
SAM: Can I sneak into the far hallway that is away
from the kitchen?

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.890
MATT: Yeah, you can do that. Make a stealth check,
please.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.358
SAM: Oh yeah, that's a one.

00:36:53.358 --> 00:36:55.834
ASHLY: Oh no.

00:36:55.834 --> 00:37:04.038
SAM: I'm going to hide, just in case they come
this way.

00:37:04.038 --> 00:37:09.998
MATT: As Nott darts around the corner, you
suddenly hit what feels like a wall at first. But

00:37:09.998 --> 00:37:16.310
it's softer and covered in material. You look up
to see one of the hooded lackeys of the Iron

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:20.851
Shepherds who had just come around the other side.
Goes, "What the fuck?" and pulls out his short sword.

00:37:21.166 --> 00:37:22.834
SAM: Oh shit.

00:37:22.834 --> 00:37:25.495
TALIESIN: I grab Nott by the scruff and lift him
away.

00:37:25.495 --> 00:37:26.224
MATT: Her you mean?

00:37:26.224 --> 00:37:27.983
TALIESIN: Her, oh thank you.

00:37:27.983 --> 00:37:30.527
SAM: Mr. Clay, I am a woman, I know you're new
here.

00:37:30.527 --> 00:37:34.298
(laughter)

00:37:34.298 --> 00:37:40.586
TALIESIN: There's a whole conversation there that
I'm excited to have when we're not having, okay--

00:37:40.586 --> 00:37:45.637
We need one for questioning man. We caught one of
them.

00:37:45.637 --> 00:37:48.058
SAM: Let me go! I didn't do nothing wrong.

00:37:48.058 --> 00:37:49.223
TALIESIN: Nope, no, we got you.

00:37:49.223 --> 00:37:51.112
MARISHA: I say shut up you miscreant and I
backhand Nott.

00:37:51.112 --> 00:37:52.565
SAM: (cries out)

00:37:52.565 --> 00:37:59.916
MATT: All right. I'll say make a deception check
Caduceus, with advantage because you've been given

00:37:59.916 --> 00:38:03.649
help from your friends.

00:38:03.649 --> 00:38:13.162
TALIESIN: My deception-- That's 15.

00:38:13.162 --> 00:38:18.757
SAM: He's going to roll. He's going to do
something.

00:38:18.757 --> 00:38:23.492
MATT: They both stop and glance and look at this,
and the one that Nott had bumped into leans

00:38:23.492 --> 00:38:28.359
forward-- you can see his squared, scarred chin
where none of his facial hair grows from some sort

00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:34.400
of deep wound he had received at a younger age.
You see his eyes, these deep, sunken brown irises

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.291
staring back, as he goes "I don't think I've ever
seen you around here before."

00:38:39.291 --> 00:38:42.610
TALIESIN: I have his face though. I have the face
of the one-- I'm not wearing a costume, am I?

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:44.266
MARISHA: "I have his face though."

00:38:44.266 --> 00:38:46.818
TALIESIN: I mean I look like one of the guards.

00:38:46.818 --> 00:38:48.989
MARISHA: Yeah, he had the disguise spell.

00:38:48.989 --> 00:38:57.002
MATT: I understand that, but not every
transformation is impervious to scrutiny. "Wait...

00:38:57.002 --> 00:39:02.788
"shit, we've been infiltrated!" He pulls his other
blade out, the guy behind him goes ahead and pulls

00:39:02.788 --> 00:39:06.060
out his blade as well. Roll initiative.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:11.144
[cheering]

00:39:11.144 --> 00:39:13.091
MATT: This is small enough where we can theater of
mind this.

00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:17.723
TALIESIN: Oh no. Where's my initiative?

00:39:18.132 --> 00:39:19.985
SAM: I've got a seven Matt.

00:39:19.985 --> 00:39:21.073
MATT: Okay.

00:39:21.073 --> 00:39:23.486
TALIESIN: I can top that. I got a six.

00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:28.237
MARISHA: 12. Not great.

00:39:28.237 --> 00:39:30.598
SAM: We've got this.

00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:34.024
ASHLY: Do I get to be part of this mix because I
was coming down the stairs?

00:39:34.024 --> 00:39:37.032
MATT: You will be in just a moment. You're
catching up to it. You're coming around the

00:39:37.032 --> 00:39:41.270
corner. They were a bit quicker than you and you
were trying to be stealthy.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:42.949
ASHLY: Trying being the operative word.

00:39:42.949 --> 00:39:48.948
MATT: No worries, all right. Beau, you're up
first-- they rolled really bad initiative.

00:39:48.948 --> 00:39:51.244
MARISHA: Oh what? Aw, cool!

00:39:51.244 --> 00:39:53.148
MATT: Not as bad as these guys, but--

00:39:53.148 --> 00:40:02.770
MARISHA: Wasn't expecting that. The one who drew
his blade-- I'm going to try and take an elbow and

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.039
do a knockout crack right to his temple.

00:40:06.039 --> 00:40:08.405
MATT: Go for it, roll for attack.

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:10.199
AUDIENCE: Don't fuck me, Gil!

00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:13.958
[laughter]

00:40:13.958 --> 00:40:21.994
MARISHA: That wasn't a Gil die, but I'll let you
know when it happens. 19.

00:40:21.994 --> 00:40:27.061
MATT: Hits. Roll damage.

00:40:27.061 --> 00:40:31.816
MARISHA: 11 damage and can I do a stunning strike?
Crack.

00:40:31.816 --> 00:40:35.677
MATT: You can. Saving throw on that is a six.

00:40:35.677 --> 00:40:41.978
MARISHA: Fail! It's only worked like once before!

00:40:41.978 --> 00:40:45.231
MATT: The one who just drew the blade-- as you
crack him upside the head, he stumbles a couple of

00:40:45.231 --> 00:40:50.168
feet into the wall. As he backs up, you can see
his eyes rolling around in the sockets and he's

00:40:50.168 --> 00:40:53.563
trying the grab the edge of the stonework to get
his bearings. He has no idea where he is for the moment.

00:40:53.982 --> 00:40:58.207
MARISHA: As he backs up, I'm going to take his
head and slam it back into the wall he just ran into.

00:40:58.207 --> 00:41:02.244
MATT: Go for it. Attack rolls have have advantage
now because he is stunned.

00:41:02.244 --> 00:41:06.374
MARISHA: Good, because that was a natural one.
17.

00:41:06.374 --> 00:41:10.767
MATT: That hits.

00:41:10.767 --> 00:41:12.634
MARISHA: 11.

00:41:12.634 --> 00:41:13.770
LIAM: You're a beast!

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.111
MATT: He's still standing, but he's looking pretty
beat up and he's just making vowel sounds now.

00:41:18.111 --> 00:41:22.052
Speech isn't capable given the series of events
that have transpired.

00:41:22.052 --> 00:41:28.161
MARISHA: I'm going to say: Shut up! And crack him
across the face again with my bonus, my off-handed.

00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:31.550
MATT: Also with advantage.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:36.922
MARISHA: That was a Gil, but he did good. 19.

00:41:36.922 --> 00:41:40.285
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

00:41:40.285 --> 00:41:42.764
MARISHA: Nine damage.

00:41:42.764 --> 00:41:46.527
MATT: As you're like, "Shh!" (crunching noises)

00:41:46.527 --> 00:41:47.999
MARISHA: Shh, go to sleep.

00:41:47.999 --> 00:41:52.643
MATT: Just repeatedly slamming his head into the
stone until his arms go limp. You slide his face

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:54.752
across the stone as he collapses to the ground.

00:41:54.752 --> 00:41:58.862
[cheering]

00:41:58.862 --> 00:42:04.156
MARISHA: I'm going to take my scarf, wipe the
wall.

00:42:04.156 --> 00:42:08.133
MATT: As you're doing that, the guy behind him,
who was his backup, sees this happen, because his

00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:11.040
initiative's next in the order, and he turns and
runs.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:17.626
[laughter, cheering]

00:42:17.626 --> 00:42:21.535
MATT: He goes at a full run and then a dash, so
he's about 60 feet away from you down the hallway

00:42:21.535 --> 00:42:24.562
getting near the front doors of the fortress.

00:42:24.562 --> 00:42:31.303
MARISHA: I'm going to shout out: Hey Keg, we got a
runner! I don't know if she heard me or not.

00:42:31.303 --> 00:42:33.876
MATT: At this point, Keg, you've just come down
the stairs. Roll initiative for me.

00:42:33.876 --> 00:42:35.290
ASHLY: I have a 16, my friend.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:41.133
MATT: That'll put you next at the top of the
order. You see this guy cross around the corner as

00:42:41.133 --> 00:42:44.065
you step to the bottom of the steps-- there's a
moment of pause where you both make eye contact,

00:42:44.065 --> 00:42:50.780
"Oh, this is awkward." We're going to finish up
with Nott and Caduceus and then we'll come back to

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.916
you. Nott, what are you doing?

00:42:52.916 --> 00:42:55.091
SAM: Can I peek around the corner where he just
ran?

00:42:55.091 --> 00:42:58.288
MATT: Yeah, you have enough movement to get around
and you can still see him as he's turning around the side.

00:42:58.288 --> 00:43:05.426
SAM: Leave no one alive! I'll fire. 27 to hit.

00:43:05.426 --> 00:43:08.004
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

00:43:08.004 --> 00:43:13.277
SAM: But it's not sneak, right?

00:43:13.277 --> 00:43:15.533
MATT: It's not sneak attack, no.

00:43:15.533 --> 00:43:25.352
SAM: Six plus five, 11 points of damage. And a
bonus action, I'll shoot again. That is a 21 to hit.

00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:27.633
MATT: That hits, roll damage again.

00:43:27.633 --> 00:43:31.428
SAM: With another six points of damage. Ah!

00:43:31.428 --> 00:43:35.419
MATT: As both crossbow bolts (zooming) in his
back, he reaches back and you can see the muscles

00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:39.461
in his shoulders pull back from the pain and he
looks back in your direction then glances back at

00:43:39.461 --> 00:43:44.667
Keg. He's not sure which threat is more nominal at
the moment. Caduceus, your turn.

00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:49.790
TALIESIN: I'm also going to peek my head around
the corner and I'm going to blow a little bit and

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.461
cast Sacred Flame.

00:43:55.052 --> 00:43:59.272
MATT: That's a natural five on his wisdom saving
throw. Dexterity or wisdom, I don't remember, but

00:43:59.272 --> 00:44:00.781
it doesn't matter.

00:44:00.781 --> 00:44:02.620
TALIESIN: It's a dex 16 save.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.383
MATT: Yeah, that's not happening.

00:44:04.383 --> 00:44:05.336
TALIESIN: I didn't think so.

00:44:05.336 --> 00:44:07.118
MATT: Go ahead and roll your damage on that.

00:44:07.118 --> 00:44:10.084
TALIESIN: That's 14 points of damage.

00:44:10.084 --> 00:44:17.458
MATT: Keg, you watch the person run around the
corner and look at you and go "Uh. (pained

00:44:17.458 --> 00:44:23.089
grunting)," get shot with two bolts from behind,
tense up, and then burst into radiant flame and

00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:26.872
then collapse to the ground, slow smoldering on
the stone.

00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:33.732
[cheering]

00:44:33.732 --> 00:44:37.718
MARISHA: I say: Never mind, Deuces got him.

00:44:37.718 --> 00:44:40.853
ASHLY: Got here a bit late. Is he dead?

00:44:40.853 --> 00:44:41.920
TALIESIN: I hope so.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.123
MATT: He will be in a moment.

00:44:43.123 --> 00:44:45.104
ASHLY: Okay, so I can leave him. He's good.

00:44:45.104 --> 00:44:47.716
MATT: It looks like he's not putting up much of a
fight at the moment.

00:44:47.716 --> 00:44:53.533
ASHLY: Should I take him out? Okay. How far away
is he from me?

00:44:53.533 --> 00:44:59.269
MATT: Roll an attack with advantage because he's--
Sure, go for it.

00:44:59.269 --> 00:45:04.651
ASHLY: That was an 18. Yeah, 18. It's plus seven.

00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:07.459
MATT: You don't even have to roll damage. You walk
up and you see him on the ground going (pained

00:45:07.459 --> 00:45:09.951
yelling) and rolling, and you shake your head.

00:45:09.951 --> 00:45:14.369
ASHLY: Shut up. 12.

00:45:14.369 --> 00:45:22.315
MATT: Like a watermelon at a Gallagher performance
you bring your war hammer down on top of his skull

00:45:22.315 --> 00:45:29.632
and paint a new carpet for the front entryway of
The Sour Nest. At that moment, it doesn't appear

00:45:29.632 --> 00:45:34.469
like there's any immediate danger or movement. You
all take a moment to look about and there's no

00:45:34.469 --> 00:45:38.673
sign of anybody else coming at the moment.

00:45:38.673 --> 00:45:41.569
LIAM: A disembodied voice says: Oh! This is going
wonderful.

00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:43.884
ASHLY: Jesus! Oh, I forgot you were there.

00:45:43.884 --> 00:45:51.634
SAM: Mr. Clay, I apologize. That was a good plan.
It was so easy!

00:45:51.634 --> 00:45:57.040
TALIESIN: That came together pretty nicely. You're
really good at the whole fake hostage thing, too.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.462
That was great acting. It was very--

00:45:58.462 --> 00:46:02.124
SAM: Ah, let me go! I'm crazy! Ah!

00:46:02.124 --> 00:46:06.902
TALIESIN: Oh, that was great. We still got two
downstairs.

00:46:06.902 --> 00:46:16.137
MATT: A strange blur streaks by. Caduceus, you see
it from the upstairs. It looks like a blur of

00:46:16.137 --> 00:46:22.744
black. No larger than that big. It scoots past and
curves around the corner, back in the direction of

00:46:22.744 --> 00:46:24.042
the basement.

00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:25.169
TALIESIN: Did somebody see something?

00:46:25.169 --> 00:46:27.039
ASHLY: What the fuck?

00:46:27.039 --> 00:46:33.593
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- I don't know why I'm
being quiet. We should head downstairs.

00:46:33.593 --> 00:46:39.377
MATT: You guys see this and begin to follow past.
Beauregard, you're still standing back by the

00:46:39.377 --> 00:46:48.182
hatch and something stops in front. Make a
perception check.

00:46:48.182 --> 00:46:51.638
MARISHA: It's not great. Ten.

00:46:51.638 --> 00:46:56.682
MATT: Ten? It wizzes right past you and you don't
even have a moment to make out any details of what it is.

00:46:56.682 --> 00:46:58.121
MARISHA: This place is fucking haunted.

00:46:58.121 --> 00:46:58.671
SAM: Kill it!

00:46:58.671 --> 00:47:04.457
MATT: It immediately heads down the stairway
towards where you found Nila's family, into the basement.

00:47:04.457 --> 00:47:06.003
MARISHA: Follow it.

00:47:06.003 --> 00:47:07.473
SAM: Kill it!

00:47:07.473 --> 00:47:08.872
MARISHA: We got to follow it first.

00:47:08.872 --> 00:47:10.540
SAM: Okay. Kill it and follow it.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.201
MARISHA and ASHLY: No. Follow it then kill it.

00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:18.548
LAIM: Will you stop arguing and can we go
downstairs? Carefully and quietly, please. Oh, by

00:47:18.548 --> 00:47:20.653
the way, I am invisible.

00:47:20.653 --> 00:47:23.272
[laughter]

00:47:23.272 --> 00:47:29.135
SAM: I didn't know you could-- Oh, the scroll. Oh.
Good job, Caleb!

00:47:29.135 --> 00:47:31.625
MARISHA: Yeah. It looks really good on you, man.

00:47:31.625 --> 00:47:39.426
[laughter]

00:47:39.426 --> 00:47:42.390
LIAM: I am actually over here, though.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.758
MARISHA: Oh. Sorry.

00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:48.540
SAM: Let's go downstairs. I'll go first.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:53.711
MATT: You guys have returned to the entry where
you had met Nila's family and sent her off to

00:47:53.711 --> 00:47:58.783
protect them. You now head down the hallway that
curves to the right. You had made some intel when

00:47:58.783 --> 00:48:05.936
you had sent Frumpkin earlier to see. You saw in
the next chamber two members, Ruzza and Protto of

00:48:05.936 --> 00:48:12.150
The Iron Shepards, waiting on the opposite end,
weapons ready, knowing you're coming. There appear

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:16.366
to be two cages with people inside, but you
couldn't make out any details.

00:48:16.366 --> 00:48:29.377
LIAM: Okay. I whisper into Nott's ear and say:
(stuttering) Just this once, I think I should go first.

00:48:29.377 --> 00:48:37.671
SAM: (gasps) You don't need to do this, Caleb, if
you don't want to.

00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:40.616
LIAM: I'm not there anymore.

00:48:40.616 --> 00:48:44.041
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So brave!

00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:51.391
[cheering]

00:48:51.391 --> 00:48:57.412
LIAM: Brave. Dead. It's semantics, really.

00:48:57.412 --> 00:49:01.979
MATT: Caleb, as you continue down the hall,
unveiling it to the right, it still appears to be

00:49:01.979 --> 00:49:08.790
open without issue. You peek further down. The
rest of you follow suit or do you stay in the back chamber?

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:12.707
ASHLY: I feel like I should hang back, probably.
stealth-wise.

00:49:12.707 --> 00:49:14.881
SAM: I'm going to go up and peek around.

00:49:14.881 --> 00:49:18.266
MATT: Make a stealth check, please. A stealth
check for you too, Caleb, but you have advantage.

00:49:18.266 --> 00:49:22.100
MARISHA: I'll follow Nott.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.960
MATT: Stealth checks for all those that are going
to follow.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.088
SAM: 27.

00:49:27.088 --> 00:49:28.678
MATT: Nice.

00:49:28.678 --> 00:49:31.631
ASHLY: How close can I get without doing a stealth
check?

00:49:31.631 --> 00:49:33.459
MATT: I don't know. Do you want to be stealthy or
not?

00:49:33.459 --> 00:49:36.423
ASHLY: Fuck. I'll hang back.

00:49:36.423 --> 00:49:40.363
MATT: Okay. Keg's going to make to the edge of the
hall and just wait.

00:49:40.363 --> 00:49:41.571
MARISHA: 18.

00:49:41.571 --> 00:49:43.262
LIAM: 17 for me.

00:49:43.262 --> 00:49:47.502
TALIESIN: 12.

00:49:47.502 --> 00:49:52.103
MATT: As you guys all make your way quietly around
the side, Caduceus's armor catches the edge of the

00:49:52.103 --> 00:49:59.449
stonework and gives this faint grinding sound. But
you work forward. Looking inside, you can see

00:49:59.449 --> 00:50:04.715
these two archways in this chamber you had
previously seen. There, on the other side, you can

00:50:04.715 --> 00:50:11.144
see Ruzza and Protto, weapons ready, whispering to
each other. As you're standing there, Caleb, that

00:50:11.144 --> 00:50:20.458
familiar sound, that buzzing, small, dark shape
appears and stops for a second there in space. You

00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:23.115
can see a small bird.

00:50:23.115 --> 00:50:29.219
[cheering]

00:50:29.219 --> 00:50:32.184
MATT: A jet black hummingbird hovering there.

00:50:32.184 --> 00:50:37.738
[louder cheering]

00:50:37.738 --> 00:50:50.120
MATT: With something long and metallic in its
beak. It darts up into the shadow and is gone.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:58.868
[laughter]

00:50:58.868 --> 00:51:02.003
ASHLY: What's happening up there?

00:51:02.003 --> 00:51:05.268
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The audience is aroused!

00:51:05.268 --> 00:51:11.377
(laughter)

00:51:11.377 --> 00:51:17.813
MATT: You hear as Ruzza looks over to Protto and
goes, "Are they coming or not? I'm getting

00:51:17.813 --> 00:51:23.210
"impatient." Protto goes, "Yeah, maybe we should
poke one of them." He pulls out a blade and jams

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:30.162
it into the cage to the left. You hear a voice
against the gag. A muffled yell.

00:51:30.162 --> 00:51:35.950
LIAM: I am going to move into the room and sit
down on the floor between the cage and the door,

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.788
pressed against the wall.

00:51:37.788 --> 00:51:38.583
MATT: Right here?

00:51:38.583 --> 00:51:42.237
LIAM: Ja and just wait.

00:51:42.237 --> 00:51:47.590
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:51:50.696 --> 00:51:51.957
LIAM: 19.

00:51:51.957 --> 00:51:56.200
MATT: You move up against the side. What faint
bit of light is coming from the almost entirely

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.873
extinguished torch on the wall. You see a bit of
shifting movement and you hear the movement of

00:51:59.873 --> 00:52:06.715
chains inside the cage where the blade had just
been stabbed inside. You see a large, shifting

00:52:06.715 --> 00:52:13.017
gray-white shape in the shadow. You hear a muffled
voice cursing against the constraints of the

00:52:13.017 --> 00:52:21.445
binding. Out of the corner of your eye, a hand
slips out of a chain, carrying the same metal

00:52:21.445 --> 00:52:24.180
object that the small bird was carrying in its
beak.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:30.449
[cheering]

00:52:30.449 --> 00:52:34.940
MATT: The hand slowly pulls the gag away from the
mouth. Khary, if you'd like to join us at the table?

00:52:34.940 --> 00:53:22.289
[roaring applause]

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:29.262
ASHLY: The murmuring!

00:53:35.654 --> 00:53:42.536
KHARY: Well, I don't know about you people, but
I'm tired of this stabbing feeling.

00:53:42.536 --> 00:53:46.468
MATT: The rest of you, what are you doing?

00:53:46.468 --> 00:53:53.512
SAM: Not hearing Caleb for a while, I'm going to,
again, creep down the hallway and peek around a bit.

00:53:53.824 --> 00:53:57.756
KHARY: Yeah, go ahead. Take your time.

00:53:57.756 --> 00:54:02.519
MARISHA: Can we do the thing? The Brady Bunch:
where all of our heads are stacked while we peek

00:54:02.519 --> 00:54:04.376
around the door.

00:54:04.376 --> 00:54:08.244
ASHLY: Screw it, I'm going to come too. I'm
sorry!

00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:14.764
SAM: Can you do some magicky things, Mr. Clay?
Something?

00:54:14.764 --> 00:54:17.975
ASHLY: That's an eight.

00:54:17.975 --> 00:54:24.234
MATT: As the three of your heads poke around the
corner, all three of you shift as Keg slams into

00:54:24.234 --> 00:54:32.151
from behind. Both of their heads, who were
currently bickering, of Protto and Ruzza look back

00:54:32.151 --> 00:54:38.034
towards the front. "Shit, they're here! Back up!"
They both begin to retract and back up into the

00:54:38.034 --> 00:54:40.153
chamber behind them.

00:54:40.153 --> 00:54:42.365
SAM: Can I shoot?

00:54:42.365 --> 00:54:43.574
MATT: If you'd like to.

00:54:43.574 --> 00:54:46.071
SAM: I would like to shoot.

00:54:46.071 --> 00:54:48.666
TALIESIN: I also have a thing I'd like to do.

00:54:48.666 --> 00:54:49.751
MATT: All right.

00:54:49.751 --> 00:54:52.724
SAM: I'll shoot at-- it's Protto and Ruzza?

00:54:52.724 --> 00:54:56.851
MATT: Well, now that we're entering combat, and
everybody's there, it's time to roll initiative.

00:54:56.851 --> 00:55:01.272
Everyone, roll initiative.

00:55:01.272 --> 00:55:03.610
ASHLY: Ugh, farts.

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:05.473
TALIESIN: Nope!

00:55:05.473 --> 00:55:07.975
MARISHA: Nope. That's not good.

00:55:07.975 --> 00:55:12.493
TALIESIN: Probably for the best.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:20.285
MATT: All righty, do we have-- (laughs) 25 to 20?

00:55:20.285 --> 00:55:23.024
SAM: No.

00:55:23.024 --> 00:55:29.619
KHARY: Oh, oh! I rolled a natural 19, so I'm
pretty sure that puts me at--

00:55:29.619 --> 00:55:32.222
MATT: What's your dexterity bonus?

00:55:32.222 --> 00:55:34.032
KHARY: Plus three, so yes I am.

00:55:34.032 --> 00:55:39.551
MATT: All right. 22. You are tied with Ruzza.

00:55:39.551 --> 00:55:44.850
KHARY: It's so nice to see familiar faces.

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:52.437
MATT: With The Duchess now perched upon the wall,
you can see, creeping around the side, the tiny

00:55:52.437 --> 00:56:00.998
goblin face of Nott and Beauregard, hood up around
the edge. For the first time in a day or two, you

00:56:01.835 --> 00:56:06.726
sense the tide turning in your favor. All right.
20 to 15, anybody?

00:56:06.726 --> 00:56:07.758
SAM: 18.

00:56:07.758 --> 00:56:10.028
LIAM: 17.

00:56:10.028 --> 00:56:12.327
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:56:12.327 --> 00:56:13.683
LIAM: 17 over here.

00:56:13.683 --> 00:56:18.663
MATT: Oh! Caleb, all righty. 15 to ten?

00:56:18.663 --> 00:56:28.869
SAM: Guys, come on. I know we want to make it
interesting for the audience, but come on.

00:56:28.869 --> 00:56:31.582
TALIESIN: Ashley Johnson has nothing on me in this
realm.

00:56:31.582 --> 00:56:33.906
MATT: All righty. ten to five?

00:56:33.906 --> 00:56:35.237
MARISHA: Seven.

00:56:35.237 --> 00:56:36.285
TALIESIN: Yay.

00:56:36.285 --> 00:56:41.826
[sympathetic yelling]

00:56:41.826 --> 00:56:46.238
TALIESIN: I actually don't move until next combat,
funny enough.

00:56:46.238 --> 00:56:47.659
ASHLY: (high pitched) Three?

00:56:47.659 --> 00:56:48.370
MATT: What did you get?

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:54.747
TALIESIN: Two. (laughing) The lowest I can roll!

00:56:54.747 --> 00:57:01.466
MATT: You guys are going to go at the same time
because you have the same dexterity. You and Ruzza

00:57:01.466 --> 00:57:05.090
are going to go at the same time, what are you
going to do?

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:10.864
KHARY: Well let's see. The best thing that I can
do is be the eyes of these people since I'm still

00:57:10.864 --> 00:57:22.189
working on getting out of my predicament. Let's
say we move The Grand Duchess to a safe, but at

00:57:22.189 --> 00:57:28.790
least well lit, place to see the action.

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:33.746
MATT: The Duchess darts across the chamber, across
from where the torch is, and perches upon a piece

00:57:33.746 --> 00:57:37.415
of the protruding stonework where she has a good
view of the hallway where they're currently

00:57:37.415 --> 00:57:40.023
receding and the chamber you're in.

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:45.229
KHARY: All right, very good. How well do I see
these two gentlemen who have been keeping me company?

00:57:45.229 --> 00:57:50.215
MATT: The gentleman and the lady, you see them
both pretty well. She, at the same turn, is

00:57:50.215 --> 00:57:57.118
running down the hallway. So what are you doing?

00:57:57.118 --> 00:58:11.416
KHARY: What can I do besides trying to pick the
lock? Is there anything I can do to knock it open

00:58:11.416 --> 00:58:16.124
at this point? I still only have one hand free,
right?

00:58:16.124 --> 00:58:21.308
MATT: You've managed to get both of your hands
free and slowly dropped the manacles and the gag.

00:58:21.308 --> 00:58:23.623
You've been working on this for a while. You're
still in the cage.

00:58:23.623 --> 00:58:36.191
KHARY: Freedom, baby! Man, I hate to use this so
early in the--

00:58:36.191 --> 00:58:40.113
ASHLY: Do it, these guys suck.

00:58:40.113 --> 00:58:46.530
KHARY: Oh, screw it. You know what? There's
nothing like a spiritual weapon to tear into a--

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:51.277
[cheering]

00:58:51.277 --> 00:58:53.903
MATT: All right, and what form is your spiritual
weapon?

00:58:53.903 --> 00:58:55.489
KHARY: That's a great question.

00:58:55.489 --> 00:59:16.287
[cheering]

00:59:16.287 --> 00:59:19.743
TALIESIN: We get props?

00:59:19.743 --> 00:59:25.262
[cheering]

00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:26.884
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:59:26.884 --> 00:59:36.637
KHARY: You know, when Shakäste makes a spiritual
weapon it's normally a very powerful woman from

00:59:36.637 --> 00:59:43.277
the past. When I saw this downstairs--

00:59:43.277 --> 00:59:50.218
(laughter)

00:59:50.218 --> 00:59:57.489
KHARY: I said: plug her in! Nefertiti is in
business. You know, I deal with royalty. I deal

00:59:57.489 --> 01:00:02.117
with queens and duchesses, man.

01:00:02.117 --> 01:00:07.219
MATT: All right. With your view, you could drop it
directly in front of Protto, or behind Protto to

01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:10.681
still try and get the strike. Would you want it in
the front or the back?

01:00:10.681 --> 01:00:21.413
KHARY: Can I bowl her down that hallway and see
how many pins I can knock over? I'm just asking.

01:00:21.413 --> 01:00:24.830
MATT: At this distance, you could get one. You'd
be able to-- next round-- try again, but you could

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.046
get the one.

01:00:26.046 --> 01:00:27.601
KHARY: All right. Let's pick up this spare.

01:00:27.601 --> 01:00:32.455
MATT: We'll say it bowls by and slams right there
towards Protto. Make a spell attack roll for me,

01:00:32.455 --> 01:00:36.218
please. So d20, add your spell attack modifier.

01:00:36.218 --> 01:00:37.197
KHARY: Big baby?

01:00:37.197 --> 01:00:39.011
MATT: Yeah.

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.408
KHARY: Seven.

01:00:40.408 --> 01:00:41.567
LIAM and MATT: Plus?

01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:43.367
KHARY: Seven plus--

01:00:43.367 --> 01:00:46.724
LIAM: It'll be your spell plus-- Oh, it's none of
these.

01:00:47.585 --> 01:00:49.123
SAM: Paperwork!

01:00:49.123 --> 01:00:50.742
LIAM and KHARY: 14.

01:00:50.742 --> 01:00:57.302
MATT: 14 unfortunately does not hit. Protto's a
nimble fellow. As Nefertiti's mystical bust slams

01:00:57.302 --> 01:01:02.296
towards him, he dodges out of the way and goes,
"Ugh!" and begins darting back towards there. That

01:01:02.296 --> 01:01:05.595
was your bonus action. You still have your action
to either cast a cantrip or do anything else with

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:08.559
your action, like pick the lock or anything else
you want to try and do.

01:01:08.559 --> 01:01:13.000
KHARY: Oh, I'd say we try to pick the lock a
little bit to see if we can get out of here.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.967
MATT: Go for it. Go ahead and roll a d20, add your
dexterity modifier and your proficiency modifier.

01:01:16.967 --> 01:01:22.148
That's three plus three. So plus six to whatever
you roll.

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:24.355
KHARY: 14, 17.

01:01:24.355 --> 01:01:25.383
LIAM and KHARY: So 20 total.

01:01:25.383 --> 01:01:30.635
MATT: 20 total? 20 is what you needed. It was a DC
20 save.

01:01:30.635 --> 01:01:36.757
[cheering]

01:01:36.757 --> 01:01:39.799
KHARY: (singing) Now I'm free, to do what I want!

01:01:39.799 --> 01:01:41.749
SAM: (singing) Any old time!

01:01:41.749 --> 01:01:46.143
MATT: Taking the small pieces of metal and wire
that The Duchess has been slowly stealing from

01:01:46.143 --> 01:01:51.093
throughout The Sour Nest and bringing back to your
cage, you manage to get the lock to fall open.

01:01:51.093 --> 01:01:57.216
With that, the cage opens and you can step out,
taking your first breath of free air in a couple of days.

01:01:57.807 --> 01:02:08.322
KHARY: Ladies and gentlemen, it feels so good to
be out with all of you beautiful people!

01:02:08.322 --> 01:02:10.301
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn?

01:02:10.301 --> 01:02:11.666
KHARY: I do believe that does.

01:02:11.666 --> 01:02:18.244
MATT: Finishing Shakäste's run, Ruzza has darted
to the back there. Let's see, that brings us--

01:02:18.244 --> 01:02:22.821
Ruzza's going to hold her action. Nott, you're up
next.

01:02:22.821 --> 01:02:25.825
SAM: Is Protto still in the room?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:29.932
MATT: Protto is out of the room, but Protto is
moving through the hall further down that way.

01:02:29.932 --> 01:02:32.025
SAM: Can I see him?

01:02:32.025 --> 01:02:32.930
MATT: Yeah.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:38.796
SAM: I would like to shoot him. But first, I'll
run closer so I'm within 30 feet.

01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:39.905
MATT: You run to within 30 feet?

01:02:39.905 --> 01:02:43.767
SAM: Yeah. Oh god. There's probably traps. Oh
shit.

01:02:43.767 --> 01:02:48.522
MATT: There you go. That's about 25, 30 feet right
there.

01:02:48.522 --> 01:02:49.669
SAM: Did I die?

01:02:49.669 --> 01:02:50.670
MATT: No.

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:59.001
SAM: Okay, cool. I will shoot my crossbow. Oh,
that's no good. 12. No, 13!

01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:03.087
MATT: 13 does not hit. Protto ducks out of the way
as it hits some of the stone wall, sparking before

01:03:03.087 --> 01:03:05.471
it lands harmlessly on the wall to the back.

01:03:05.471 --> 01:03:08.725
SAM: One more shot, bonus action. That's better,
19!

01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:10.580
MATT: 19 does hit, roll damage.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.920
ASHLY: Okay, good.

01:03:13.494 --> 01:03:17.345
SAM: That's ten points of damage!

01:03:17.345 --> 01:03:21.233
MATT: Not bad. As he dodges the first one, the
other one-- He tries to duck out of the way and

01:03:21.233 --> 01:03:24.391
instead, you see it vanish into the cloak. At
first, you thought it just passed through

01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:28.886
harmlessly, but you hear an "Ugh!" and he falls
and limps against the wall for a second before

01:03:28.886 --> 01:03:31.155
looking up in your direction with a snarl.

01:03:31.155 --> 01:03:32.433
SAM: (yelp)

01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:34.328
MATT: All right. That finish your turn?

01:03:34.328 --> 01:03:36.441
SAM: Have I done all of my movement? Yeah?

01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:39.203
MATT: No. Technically, you still have about 15
feet.

01:03:39.203 --> 01:03:44.628
SAM: I'll just duck over towards Shakäste so I'm
not right in eyeline of either of the hallway baddies.

01:03:44.826 --> 01:03:51.431
MATT: You go to duck over towards Shakäste, and
your face hits something that's not there. It's

01:03:51.431 --> 01:03:53.123
like some sort of invisible force.

01:03:53.123 --> 01:03:58.893
SAM: Why do I keep running into things? I need
contact lenses.

01:03:58.893 --> 01:04:01.718
MATT: You immediately recognize the familiar scent
of Caleb's coat right in front of you.

01:04:01.718 --> 01:04:05.170
SAM: Oh! Caleb! Caleb, is that you?

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:06.730
LIAM: Act natural.

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.854
[laughter]

01:04:09.854 --> 01:04:12.423
SAM: All right.

01:04:12.423 --> 01:04:14.730
MATT: Caleb, it's your turn.

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:21.457
LIAM: I'm going to slide out away from Nott and go
to the other side, clear of the hallway, to look

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:24.482
into the cage that's there.

01:04:24.482 --> 01:04:25.825
MATT: Into the cage across--

01:04:25.825 --> 01:04:30.747
LIAM: To the other side of the room. Is anyone
alive or dead in that cage?

01:04:30.747 --> 01:04:33.364
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:37.150
LIAM: That is a 19.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:48.182
MATT: Okay. Inside, you see two people. You see a
small child and a dwarf male, older. Both are

01:04:48.182 --> 01:04:53.217
looking scared, the child especially, but the
dwarf has his arms around the child protectively.

01:04:53.217 --> 01:04:56.252
Though it is a human child, it looks like they've
both been in captivity for a bit and at least he's

01:04:56.252 --> 01:05:00.833
feeling protective of the child. They're both
stripped of any necessary implements aside from

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:05.982
just their clothing, and they look scared, but not
too worse for wear.

01:05:05.982 --> 01:05:15.270
LIAM: Okay. Er, Hello... I am invisible. Stay as
low as possible, and this will all blow over

01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:20.739
quickly, I think. That's the end of my turn.

01:05:20.739 --> 01:05:30.051
MATT: That brings us to Protto. He's going to-- Is
this working?

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:31.985
SAM: It's not working.

01:05:31.985 --> 01:05:38.767
MATT: There we go. Protto's going to dart over to
join Ruzza at the back and says, "Quick, send it

01:05:38.767 --> 01:05:47.422
"down!" Ruzza, who's been holding her action,
reaches back and grabs some sort of a lever. At

01:05:47.422 --> 01:05:50.507
which point-- both of the archways to the front
and the back of the chamber that you're in-- you

01:05:50.507 --> 01:05:53.708
hear this grinding of chains.

01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:59.006
MARISHA: Ooh. No!

01:05:59.006 --> 01:06:00.536
SAM: Are you out? You're outside of the room.

01:06:00.536 --> 01:06:04.300
ASHLY: No, I came in with you guys, I think. Am I
not in?

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.922
SAM: I don't think you're in.

01:06:05.922 --> 01:06:13.457
MATT: Sealing the three of you in the chamber.
Beauregard, Keg, Caduceus, in the hallway behind,

01:06:13.457 --> 01:06:17.594
as you spin around the corner, this portcullis
suddenly slams down, separating you from the other

01:06:17.594 --> 01:06:19.167
half of your party.

01:06:19.167 --> 01:06:20.570
SAM: Matt Mercer!

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.829
MARISHA: That's not good.

01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:25.820
SAM: First the T-shirt and now this? You bastard!

01:06:27.354 --> 01:06:33.450
MATT: Protto, who has kept you at bay and can see
the space between the bars, takes out his

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:41.199
crossbow. The one that he can see best at this
moment is Nott. He's going to take a shot at Nott.

01:06:41.199 --> 01:06:44.403
That's going to be a 17 plus four?

01:06:44.403 --> 01:06:47.081
SAM: Oh yeah, that hits. For sure.

01:06:47.081 --> 01:06:54.890
MATT: Plus six to hit. That hits. This is a
longbow, not a crossbow. My apologies. That's two

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.291
plus four. You take six points of piercing
damage.

01:06:57.291 --> 01:06:59.701
SAM: Okay. Yes, fine.

01:06:59.701 --> 01:07:02.367
MATT: Then he's going to dart around the corner.

01:07:02.367 --> 01:07:06.967
SAM: Oh wait, I can take my little-- my reaction,
can't I?

01:07:06.967 --> 01:07:07.854
MATT: Yes, you can.

01:07:07.854 --> 01:07:13.291
SAM: What is that thing called? Uncanny Dodge?
Uncanny Dodge! I'll reduce that to three.

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:19.444
MATT: There you go, so three damage to you. That's
going to end Protto's go, as he darts around the

01:07:19.444 --> 01:07:21.435
corner. Beau, you're up.

01:07:21.435 --> 01:07:30.350
MARISHA: Okay. I come around the gate. I look in
and I go, hey, Shakäste!

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:32.923
KHARY: Hello, darling.

01:07:32.923 --> 01:07:35.261
MARISHA: What's up? What're you doing out here?

01:07:35.261 --> 01:07:39.678
KHARY: Well, you know, vacationing.

01:07:39.678 --> 01:07:45.221
SAM: More like a staycation.

01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:53.289
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my action and start
wedging my staff up under the door, and maybe

01:07:53.289 --> 01:07:56.615
Deuces can help me crank it open.

01:07:56.615 --> 01:08:02.074
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to turn around and
start searching that hallway.

01:08:02.074 --> 01:08:07.025
MARISHA: Oh. Cool, man. Yeah. I'm not doing
something really important here to keep our

01:08:07.025 --> 01:08:09.342
friends from reaching their peril.

01:08:09.342 --> 01:08:13.559
MATT: You hold your action to try to wedge it,
look back for his help, and you see him turn the

01:08:13.559 --> 01:08:19.073
other direction and start walking away. Are you
going to continue with your action or still hold it?

01:08:19.346 --> 01:08:21.282
MARISHA: Real cool, man. Keg?

01:08:21.282 --> 01:08:28.028
ASHLY: I'm going to try to pull a Nila and fucking
rip that shit open with my bare hands. We will

01:08:28.028 --> 01:08:33.756
see! Come on, baby. No whammies.

01:08:33.756 --> 01:08:37.424
MATT: Keg comes through that. You have advantage
on this because Beauregard is helping you because

01:08:37.424 --> 01:08:39.191
she's holding her action to help with that.

01:08:39.191 --> 01:08:46.229
ASHLY: Seriously, no whammies this time, please.
Fuck! So that's a 16.

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:51.189
MATT: The bars begin to pull open ever so
slightly, but not enough. You do feel, however,

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:54.368
that whatever weight is carrying it down, it's
heavy, but with two people you might have a chance

01:08:54.368 --> 01:08:58.732
of lifting it. But it looks like the bars are too
thick to try and pull apart.

01:08:58.732 --> 01:09:01.885
ASHLY: I did the wrong-- We should-- Under's
better.

01:09:01.885 --> 01:09:05.138
MARISHA: That's okay. With our legs... lower back,
you know.

01:09:05.138 --> 01:09:06.905
ASHLY: Yeah.

01:09:06.905 --> 01:09:09.224
MATT: That ends Keg's turn. Caduceus.

01:09:09.224 --> 01:09:13.557
TALIESIN: I want to search this little hallway for
a switch or some kind of panel to open this thing

01:09:13.557 --> 01:09:14.656
from this side.

01:09:14.656 --> 01:09:15.758
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:09:15.758 --> 01:09:18.343
TALIESIN: All right. Is there anything I can do?

01:09:18.343 --> 01:09:21.378
SAM: He's so calm under pressure. He's like a
walking quaalude.

01:09:21.378 --> 01:09:26.437
[laughter]

01:09:26.437 --> 01:09:28.570
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. I don't find anything.

01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:30.179
MATT: What'd you get?

01:09:30.179 --> 01:09:36.393
TALIESIN: After adding my negative investigation
number, it's a one.

01:09:36.393 --> 01:09:42.232
MATT: You start to just trace the stonework with
your fingers and then find this really fascinating

01:09:42.232 --> 01:09:50.204
bit of moss. Soft green, it's been growing in the
crevice. You haven't seen this type of moss before.

01:09:50.456 --> 01:09:52.572
TALIESIN: Hey, fella. Hi friend.

01:09:52.572 --> 01:09:54.105
MATT: You forget for the moment what you're
doing.

01:09:54.105 --> 01:09:58.540
TALIESIN: What? Oh. Yeah.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:05.327
MATT: Top of the turn, that brings us to Shakäste
and Ruzza. Now, she's going first because she's a

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:13.138
little quicker than you on this one. Ruzza's going
to... Let's see here... Yeah, she's going to

01:10:13.138 --> 01:10:21.755
Vicious Mockery. That's a fun one. Looking through
at Shakäste, since you're the one who stepped out

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:26.688
of the cage, and they had seen you there for a
bit, looks over to you and goes, "Oh, I'm sorry.

01:10:26.688 --> 01:10:31.964
"Were our bedding arrangements not good enough for
you? Oh, we can arrange for a much better place to

01:10:31.964 --> 01:10:37.210
"sleep, about six feet beneath this." Make a wisdom
saving throw, please.

01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.274
SAM: Oh, no.

01:10:38.274 --> 01:10:39.631
ASHLY: I hope you're wise.

01:10:39.631 --> 01:10:42.225
TALIESIN: Oh, I can do it.

01:10:42.225 --> 01:10:45.845
MARISHA: Wise as fuck.

01:10:45.845 --> 01:10:47.011
KHARY: 20.

01:10:47.011 --> 01:10:49.220
SAM: Whoa. Never mind.

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.762
MATT: Oh, yeah.

01:10:50.762 --> 01:10:52.302
TALIESIN: Cannot be mocked.

01:10:52.302 --> 01:10:54.861
MATT: Like water off a duck's back: doesn't bother
you.

01:10:54.861 --> 01:11:07.791
KHARY: (chuckling, then laughing) Darling, you
just put one obstacle between us. You know I'm

01:11:07.791 --> 01:11:13.294
just going to knock that one down, too.

01:11:13.294 --> 01:11:17.006
SAM: I think they're in love.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:20.335
MARISHA: No, there's definitely sexual tension.

01:11:20.335 --> 01:11:24.656
KHARY: Ain't no mountain high enough.

01:11:24.656 --> 01:11:27.830
MATT: All righty. What are you going to do for
your turn?

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:36.118
KHARY: Let's see. Well, I believe that trapped
within that gate is the beautiful Queen Nefertiti.

01:11:36.118 --> 01:11:43.866
I think she should just go slamming her ass all up
and down that hallway.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:48.789
MATT: Go ahead and roll another attack. d20, big
one.

01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:55.277
KHARY: Oh, that didn't work. Let's see, what did
that end up doing?

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:57.041
LIAM: What are you trying to roll?

01:11:57.041 --> 01:12:01.315
MATT: That's your spell attack modifier. Should be
a plus seven, I think?

01:12:01.315 --> 01:12:03.470
KHARY: Oh. So ten.

01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:10.065
MATT: Yeah, once again Nefertiti goes grinding
through the hallway, slamming near Ruzza. Ruzza

01:12:10.065 --> 01:12:13.882
quickly ducks out of the way and dodges over to
where Protto is hiding.

01:12:13.882 --> 01:12:21.631
KHARY: The Queen's used to having other people do
her work for her, I guess. Why don't I point my

01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:30.020
middle finger down through those slats in the gate
and send some Sacred Flame?

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:37.636
MATT: Yeah, that'll work. That's a wisdom saving
throw, I believe. Or Sacred Flame is dexterity? I

01:12:37.636 --> 01:12:44.929
think it is. Either way, let's see what she rolls.
That's a 13 plus--

01:12:44.929 --> 01:12:46.389
SAM: Oh, that's a good roll.

01:12:46.389 --> 01:12:48.861
MATT: Taliesin, is it wisdom or dexterity for
Sacred Flame?

01:12:48.861 --> 01:12:51.205
SAM: Sacred Flame, save. You said dex?

01:12:51.205 --> 01:12:52.875
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was dex for me.

01:12:52.875 --> 01:12:59.296
MATT: Dex. So that's a 19. That's a success. As
the middle finger sticks through, she ducks out of

01:12:59.296 --> 01:13:03.660
the way. She's a wily one, that Ruzza, and she
keeps dodging and weaving, dancing around your assault.

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:07.416
KHARY: Next time, I'll use the other finger.

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:11.979
MARISHA: So much sexual tension. They had a
thing.

01:13:11.979 --> 01:13:16.476
SAM: Get a room, guys!

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:19.833
MATT: Finishing up Shakäste's turn, that brings us
to Nott. What're you doing?

01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:22.342
SAM: Oh, me? Again? I just went! Great.

01:13:22.342 --> 01:13:23.691
MATT: You're on deck, Caleb.

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:29.016
SAM: I'm going to run up to the cage. Do I still
see them? Through the portcullis?

01:13:29.016 --> 01:13:32.162
MATT: You don't see Protto, but you see Ruzza.

01:13:32.162 --> 01:13:34.318
SAM: All right, I'll take a shot at Ruzza!

01:13:34.318 --> 01:13:35.345
MATT: Go for it.

01:13:35.345 --> 01:13:37.878
SAM: Pew! That's 25.

01:13:37.878 --> 01:13:40.033
MATT: Oh, that'll hit.

01:13:40.033 --> 01:13:47.211
SAM: I get to roll, but still no sneak attack,
damn it. Six.

01:13:47.211 --> 01:13:51.956
MATT: Six points of damage to Ruzza.

01:13:51.956 --> 01:13:57.739
SAM: I guess I'll shoot again. Yeah because I
can't lift this thing, and I'm a wee thing.

01:13:57.739 --> 01:13:59.340
MATT: I mean, you can certainly try.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:04.040
SAM: No, I can't. I'll just shoot again. That's an
18.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.545
MATT: 18 hits. Roll damage again.

01:14:06.545 --> 01:14:13.024
SAM: That's 11 points of damage. Ah! These are
rolls! These are good rolls today.

01:14:13.024 --> 01:14:19.079
MATT: Firing between these bars of the portcullis,
you fire both bolts. Both of them sink into the

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:24.043
armor and probably pierce and intrude too, into
the torso of Ruzza. As she falls back against the

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:29.022
wall, "Ah, you son of a bitch." (panting)

01:14:29.022 --> 01:14:35.237
SAM: Then I'm going to duck around again so they
can't see me. Just anywhere.

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:37.839
MATT: Right up next to you, you bump into an
invisible Caleb again.

01:14:37.839 --> 01:14:42.574
SAM: Aah! Are there duplicates of you? How are you
doing this?

01:14:42.574 --> 01:14:44.699
LIAM: I am very stealthy.

01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:48.087
SAM: Ah! You are amazing!

01:14:48.087 --> 01:14:49.817
MATT: Caleb, it's your turn.

01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:58.164
LIAM: This seems to be going okay, not so bad. Are
those tables by the gate that Keg and Beauregard

01:14:58.164 --> 01:15:04.207
are trying to pull up? Not the room I'm in. I am
going to kick one over and roll it over because I

01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:08.829
can see Keg jimmying on the gate. I see where she
is going with it and I am going to be ready to

01:15:08.829 --> 01:15:14.753
push it under once it's lifted up. I will hold my
turn, but I am going to do that pushing my rear

01:15:14.753 --> 01:15:18.954
end out of the way of view of anyone even though I
am invisible.

01:15:18.954 --> 01:15:20.771
MATT: Just for the hell of it, make an athletics
check for me.

01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:23.081
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

01:15:23.081 --> 01:15:24.591
TALIESIN: Always fun.

01:15:24.591 --> 01:15:29.865
LIAM: What could go wrong? Big six.

01:15:29.865 --> 01:15:36.305
MATT: All right. You manage to make it most of the
way over but its a relatively heavy table for your

01:15:36.305 --> 01:15:40.363
size and diminutive form.

01:15:40.363 --> 01:15:42.209
LIAM: I have average strength.

01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:44.470
MATT: You can probably get it there by the end of
next round but you're in process.

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.919
LIAM: Yeah okay.

01:15:46.919 --> 01:15:48.916
TALIESIN: Aw, there's a tiny table you can move.

01:15:48.916 --> 01:15:52.408
MATT: Finishing Caleb's go, it is now Protto's
turn. Protto is going to go ahead and dart back

01:15:52.408 --> 01:16:03.300
around the corner, ducks beneath Nefertiti and
then is going to take two shots at Beauregard but

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.663
because it is between two portcullises he has
disadvantage on the strikes. There is only one he

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:13.493
can currently see down this long hallway. So the
first shot is a natural 20 but disadvantage. That

01:16:13.493 --> 01:16:16.447
is a nine plus six. That is a 15 to hit. What's
your armor class?

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:17.870
MARISHA: Miss. 17.

01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:20.473
ASHLY: Nice.

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:23.135
MATT: Second shot is 19 to hit.

01:16:23.135 --> 01:16:25.259
MARISHA: Oh, hits!

01:16:25.259 --> 01:16:32.350
MATT: So, the second longbow shot releases towards
you for eight points of piercing damage.

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:41.184
MARISHA: I'm going to use my reaction to deflect
missiles. Oh, I rolled a nine. Sorry! I should

01:16:41.184 --> 01:16:44.332
have dictated that.

01:16:44.332 --> 01:16:49.124
MATT: The first one goes wide and hits the wall
beyond the boundaries of the portcullis. The

01:16:49.124 --> 01:16:51.926
second one you see coming towards you and you just
catch it.

01:16:51.926 --> 01:16:56.589
MARISHA: I would probably have disadvantage if I'm
throwing it back through?

01:16:56.589 --> 01:16:58.781
MATT: Probably yeah.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:01.970
MARISHA: (high pitched hum of uncertainty)

01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:05.231
[cheering]

01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:11.129
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm going
to pull some Gambit moves and try to-- right

01:17:11.129 --> 01:17:13.958
through the door. Toss it back.

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:18.342
SAM and MARISHA: Monk shit!

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:20.445
SAM: Guys, this material does not breathe.

01:17:20.445 --> 01:17:21.772
MARISHA: Can I get a "Don't fuck me, Gil"?

01:17:21.772 --> 01:17:24.883
[cheering]

01:17:24.883 --> 01:17:29.579
MARISHA: Aw, Gil fucked me! Seven!

01:17:29.579 --> 01:17:34.483
MATT: You go to throw it and it hits the bar
immediately upon releasing and shoots off at the

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:40.442
side. It skids to a stop at the foot of Shakäste
as he looks down at it, confused.

01:17:40.442 --> 01:17:41.967
MARISHA: I got this for you.

01:17:41.967 --> 01:17:45.384
[laughter]

01:17:45.384 --> 01:17:46.983
KHARY: You've always been so thoughtful.

01:17:46.983 --> 01:17:48.341
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

01:17:48.341 --> 01:17:49.800
KHARY: Thank you.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.607
MATT: Beau. That was the end of Protto's turn.
Protto is going to move back behind the corner.

01:17:54.607 --> 01:18:00.322
Now it's your turn.

01:18:00.322 --> 01:18:04.715
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to wait for Keg so we can
hoist.

01:18:04.715 --> 01:18:08.523
MATT: Holding that. Keg it's your go. With
advantage.

01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:10.101
ASHLY: (singing) 20!

01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:11.661
SAM: Natural 20!

01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:18.754
[cheering]

01:18:18.754 --> 01:18:22.503
MATT: Beau, as you squat down to get your hands in
the position to grab it you're like, "All right,

01:18:22.503 --> 01:18:26.965
"time to go!" As you go to reach for it, it's
already lifted up.

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:31.173
MARISHA: Man, it was really light actually, I
don't--

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:34.305
MATT: You see Keg there just holding it up, both
arms overhead.

01:18:34.305 --> 01:18:36.831
ASHLY: 'Sup. (tongue click)

01:18:36.831 --> 01:18:40.964
MARISHA: Beau is aroused.

01:18:40.964 --> 01:18:47.190
MATT: With that, Caleb scoots the table back into
space to keep it held somewhat aloft.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:54.263
LIAM: (strained) Yeah, this table is pretty heavy
too.

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:58.706
ASHLY: Do I have more things? Can I rush forward
and try the second door?

01:18:58.706 --> 01:19:01.658
MATT: That would be an additional action, but you
can move through the space if you would like.

01:19:01.658 --> 01:19:02.732
ASHLY: Okay.

01:19:02.732 --> 01:19:04.104
MARISHA: I move through as well if I can.

01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:06.598
MATT: Unfortunately, you had to ready your action
on your turn so you don't have any movement.

01:19:06.598 --> 01:19:08.945
MARISHA: Okay, copy.

01:19:10.796 --> 01:19:14.164
MATT: That puts you right up next to Shakäste.
Shakäste, of all the friends that you recognize

01:19:14.164 --> 01:19:22.827
coming into this event, you watch as this
short-haired, burly, gritty, stubble-chinned

01:19:22.827 --> 01:19:29.100
female dwarf in full jagged looking half-plate
armor comes up with two heavy weapons: one a giant

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.483
warhammer, the other a battleaxe. The edge of a
mostly burned cigarette dangling at the edge of

01:19:34.483 --> 01:19:40.585
the lip. After holding this thing up and stepping
through, dropping it behind her.

01:19:40.585 --> 01:19:43.791
KHARY: So what's your name?

01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:48.837
ASHLY: Keg, as in booze or powder. Explosions et
cetera. What's your name?

01:19:48.837 --> 01:19:54.349
KHARY: Shakäste. We'll get a keg later, Keg.

01:19:54.349 --> 01:19:56.930
[laughter]

01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:59.014
SAM: Get a room you two!

01:19:59.014 --> 01:20:01.820
(laughter)

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.862
ASHLY: Keg is aroused?

01:20:05.862 --> 01:20:07.234
SAM: Is he flipping you?

01:20:07.234 --> 01:20:08.495
MATT: Question mark?

01:20:08.495 --> 01:20:11.005
ASHLY: I go both ways, baby!

01:20:11.005 --> 01:20:19.470
KHARY: What can I say? I love a strong woman.
Let's do this.

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:20.948
MATT: Caduceus, it's your turn.

01:20:20.948 --> 01:20:26.085
TALIESIN: I see that this is no longer fruitful.
Get a little momentary frustration. I'm going to

01:20:26.085 --> 01:20:31.587
drop this ridiculous form I'm in and go back to
normal. I'm going to dive underneath the door,

01:20:31.587 --> 01:20:41.055
take a look, assess the situation. I'm going to
take my staff, and I'm going to whisper to it:

01:20:41.055 --> 01:20:48.988
It's lunchtime, children. Let's throw a swarm of
insects right into the middle.

01:20:48.988 --> 01:20:56.610
MATT: You watch the naturally twisted and gnarled
wooden staff that Caduceus carries, which

01:20:56.610 --> 01:21:04.478
previously had a dozen of small knot holes in it,
suddenly begin to exude dozens and dozens and

01:21:04.478 --> 01:21:13.181
dozens of small beetles that begin to swarm out of
the staff and curling onto the ground. You can place it.

01:21:14.017 --> 01:21:20.608
TALIESIN: Can I put it right on top of that
problem in the corner, so it can't quite be seen

01:21:20.608 --> 01:21:23.648
by anyone down the hall, but close enough to
bite?

01:21:23.648 --> 01:21:25.610
MATT: It's 30 feet, you can't quite get it to
them.

01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:28.265
TALIESIN: Even if I go all the way? Okay. How
close can I get to him?

01:21:28.265 --> 01:21:33.950
MATT: You're right next to him. This swarm of
beetles is right beneath the floating bust of Nefertiti.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.492
TALIESIN: Can it make a bite attack?

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:38.133
MATT: It won't be able to attack this turn,
unfortunately.

01:21:38.133 --> 01:21:43.207
TALIESIN: I think I get a bite attack on first
appearance.

01:21:43.207 --> 01:21:45.879
MATT: Right, but how close can you summon it?

01:21:45.879 --> 01:21:46.964
TALIESIN: 30 feet.

01:21:46.964 --> 01:21:48.999
MATT: Right, so it appears 30 feet--

01:21:48.999 --> 01:21:50.613
TALIESIN: Can't move yet.

01:21:50.613 --> 01:21:52.863
MATT: Right, but it's not quite close enough to
bite. It's about ten feet away.

01:21:52.863 --> 01:22:00.384
TALIESIN: It's cool. You look really cool. Hi.

01:22:00.384 --> 01:22:10.386
KHARY: Hello. So do you! I don't know who does
your hair, but we could talk about it later.

01:22:10.386 --> 01:22:17.229
TALIESIN: I'm very impressed. Now that I realize
that we're in fighting shot, I'm going to back up

01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:20.983
so I'm to the far left corner.

01:22:20.983 --> 01:22:22.763
MATT: The rest of your movement puts you right
there.

01:22:22.763 --> 01:22:29.227
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can get? All right,
I'll go invisible until my next turn.

01:22:29.227 --> 01:22:30.112
MATT: As a bonus action?

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:30.917
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:22:30.917 --> 01:22:33.548
SAM: Whoa! You can just do that?

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:38.484
TALIESIN: You don't know me!

01:22:38.484 --> 01:22:43.913
KHARY: I'm going to need somebody to teach me this
trick.

01:22:43.913 --> 01:22:51.130
MATT: That finishes your turn. At the top of the
round, as you're all gearing, this bassy, resonant

01:22:51.130 --> 01:23:02.474
voice fills the chamber you're in. "Mm."

01:23:02.474 --> 01:23:06.140
SAM: Boo!

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:16.245
MATT: "It's rare that the meat carries itself
right to your table." You don't see anything

01:23:16.245 --> 01:23:18.369
around you. That's all it says.

01:23:18.369 --> 01:23:24.871
MARISHA: He's invisible, too?! Everyone knows this
trick!

01:23:24.871 --> 01:23:29.900
MATT: At the top of the round, Ruzza, seeing that
the scenario is turning and this trap scenario

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.865
isn't going in their favor, darts away.

01:23:32.865 --> 01:23:34.164
SAM: Darts away?

01:23:34.164 --> 01:23:38.076
MATT: Darts further down that hall. Shakäste.

01:23:38.076 --> 01:23:40.532
KHARY: Is there anybody still in that hallway?

01:23:40.532 --> 01:23:44.774
MATT: Not that you can see. There is still that
portcullis blocking your path.

01:23:44.774 --> 01:23:55.121
KHARY: Okay, let's see. Let's have the Duchess
move a little further, through the slats into that

01:23:55.121 --> 01:24:02.989
corner, perch up there, and see if she can see
down the hallway a little bit.

01:24:02.989 --> 01:24:06.219
MATT: The Duchess manages to find her way over to
the far corner of that hall, perches up to give

01:24:06.219 --> 01:24:16.667
you a view, and you can see as Ruzza is making her
way down the edge and around the corner, vanishing

01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:24.336
into this next chamber. Oh god, I'm knocking
things over. It happens, I'm sorry. It's fine.

01:24:24.336 --> 01:24:33.153
They'll be okay in the end. There we go. Ending
your view there, what are you going to do?

01:24:33.153 --> 01:24:36.805
SAM: Marisha, did you just look at me? Is that
what's happened? That's why you're suddenly laughing?

01:24:36.924 --> 01:24:42.486
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah, fuck you. Sorry.

01:24:43.948 --> 01:24:57.469
KHARY: Let's see. Oh, you know what? Is there a
mechanism for opening that gate?

01:24:57.469 --> 01:24:59.981
MATT: You can spend the rest of your turn
investigating the room for something like that, if

01:24:59.981 --> 01:25:00.787
you'd like.

01:25:00.787 --> 01:25:02.329
KHARY: Yeah, why don't we do that?

01:25:02.329 --> 01:25:03.411
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

01:25:03.411 --> 01:25:10.489
KHARY: All right. What do I roll again? 20? 12.

01:25:10.489 --> 01:25:17.759
MATT: You don't see anything in the chamber. The
only thing that you did notice was the switch at

01:25:17.759 --> 01:25:22.882
the end of the hallway that Ruzza had originally
put down to send the portcullises falling.

01:25:22.882 --> 01:25:24.669
SAM: We saw that?

01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:26.947
MATT: You saw them drop the portcullises, yeah.

01:25:26.947 --> 01:25:30.400
MARISHA: Is it a-- or a button?

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.280
MATT: No, it's a small lever that goes downward
and causes them to be released, to slam down.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.114
KHARY: Too big for a tiny bird.

01:25:38.114 --> 01:25:42.288
MATT: For a tiny bird, yeah.

01:25:42.288 --> 01:25:46.268
KHARY: Is that the end of my turn?

01:25:46.268 --> 01:25:48.517
MATT: You have an action, if you wanted to try
something else.

01:25:48.517 --> 01:25:56.001
KHARY: Let's see, is there anything that we could
do to shake this thing free?

01:25:56.001 --> 01:25:58.854
LIAM: Spiritual Weapon it?

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:06.093
KHARY: Oh yeah, why don't we slam the gate with
Nefertiti? Let's see if we can find something she can hit.

01:26:06.339 --> 01:26:10.213
MATT: Have Nefertiti roll an attack against the
wall.

01:26:10.213 --> 01:26:17.798
KHARY: All right. Natural one.

01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:25.611
SAM: It's that big headdress. It's getting in the
way. Yeah, restart it. Sometimes that what's you

01:26:25.611 --> 01:26:27.952
got to do with Nefertitis.

01:26:27.952 --> 01:26:34.926
KHARY: Sometimes if you turn it off and turn it
on, it helps.

01:26:34.926 --> 01:26:40.287
MATT: As the bust slams into the bars, the metal
rings from the impact, but unfortunately the mild

01:26:40.287 --> 01:26:46.280
bulging of the metal on this side isn't enough to
cause any damage. Does that finish your turn?

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.501
KHARY: That's it, yeah.

01:26:48.501 --> 01:26:51.285
MATT: All right, that brings it to Nott, with
Caleb on deck.

01:26:51.285 --> 01:26:59.822
SAM: Nott's going to run up to the cage and reach
out with her Mage Hand and try to flip the switch.

01:27:00.384 --> 01:27:07.031
MATT: As it does so, you hear (clicking) and the
portcullis begins to raise up.

01:27:07.031 --> 01:27:12.161
[cheering]

01:27:12.161 --> 01:27:14.580
ASHLY: Good job, Nott!

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:29.705
SAM: I'm going to inch around Nefertiti. Excuse
me, Mrs. Titi. Pardon me. Is Protto still there,

01:27:29.705 --> 01:27:32.440
or did Protto bug out?

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.263
MATT: No, Protto is ducked around the corner.

01:27:34.263 --> 01:27:35.464
SAM: And Ruzza's still there?

01:27:35.464 --> 01:27:38.545
MATT: They both disappeared around the corner,
from your perspective.

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:41.946
SAM: All I see is a hallway and a swarm of bees?

01:27:41.946 --> 01:27:43.581
MATT: Well, swarm of beetles, yes.

01:27:43.581 --> 01:27:50.521
SAM: Okay. I don't want to go through the swarm of
insects. I don't know what would happen.

01:27:50.521 --> 01:27:52.215
MATT: Only one way to find out.

01:27:52.215 --> 01:28:07.704
SAM: Oh Jesus. I will run through the swarm of
insects, and bonus action disengage from them! I

01:28:07.704 --> 01:28:08.795
don't know if that works!

01:28:08.795 --> 01:28:12.787
MATT: As you dart and vault over the beetles, they
seem to not pay you any mind or really care of

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:19.406
your presence, but nevertheless, you dodge the
shit out of them! They never had a chance!

01:28:19.406 --> 01:28:26.799
SAM: Just in case, I grab some chopsticks and I
catch one.

01:28:26.799 --> 01:28:31.561
MATT: As you turn around the corner, immediately,
maybe ten feet from you, is Protto, who's

01:28:31.561 --> 01:28:36.908
currently pulling another arrow out of his bow and
turning around the corner, glancing over. "Ah, shit!"

01:28:37.185 --> 01:28:42.528
SAM: Can I duck back behind the corner, or am I
exposed?

01:28:42.528 --> 01:28:46.075
MATT: Your movement got you right around that
corner. That's going to be the end of it there.

01:28:46.075 --> 01:28:47.313
Caleb, you're up.

01:28:47.313 --> 01:28:52.416
LIAM: Yeah, okay. Since the gate is open, I'm
going to start slowly walking down the hallway

01:28:52.416 --> 01:29:02.519
after Nott, sticking close to the wall. That's as
far as I get?

01:29:02.519 --> 01:29:06.376
MATT: That's as far as you can get on 30 feet of
movement. You can use your action to dash if you want.

01:29:06.598 --> 01:29:13.045
LIAM: I could, but I don't want to do that. I will
put Frumpkin on the wall, opposite me, ten feet

01:29:13.045 --> 01:29:21.119
ahead of me. I would love to give Frumpkin his
turn to go as far along the ceiling after Nott as he can.

01:29:21.119 --> 01:29:22.847
MATT: What's the movement of the spider again?

01:29:22.847 --> 01:29:26.404
LIAM: Oh, you know, 120 feet.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:32.689
SAM: Question: did we ever get the father and son
out of the cage?

01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:34.072
ASHLY: No, they're still in there.

01:29:34.072 --> 01:29:37.778
LIAM: 20 feet.

01:29:37.778 --> 01:29:47.900
MATT: All right, so Frumpkin moves 20 feet along
the ceiling on the edge, making his way further

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:51.606
down, not full enough to reveal the next chamber,
but is there nevertheless.

01:29:51.606 --> 01:29:55.025
LIAM: Okay, and I will just stay pressed against
the wall and that is the end of my turn.

01:29:55.025 --> 01:30:03.455
MATT: Okay, that finishes Caleb's go. Protto's up.
Protto runs and disappears into the next chamber.

01:30:03.455 --> 01:30:11.709
You hear a door open. That's all. That finishes.
Beau, your turn.

01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:15.749
MARISHA: I halt everybody, and I say: Wait.

01:30:15.749 --> 01:30:18.684
ALL: Wait.

01:30:18.684 --> 01:30:21.773
AUDIENCE: Wait!

01:30:21.773 --> 01:30:24.501
MATT: This is absurd.

01:30:25.404 --> 01:30:32.707
MARISHA: I don't know. This feels like we're being
lured right into a trap. We're following him.

01:30:32.707 --> 01:30:34.584
TALIESIN: That's what it feels like, all right.

01:30:34.584 --> 01:30:36.312
ASHLY: Where's Caleb? Caleb?

01:30:36.312 --> 01:30:37.874
MARISHA: Caleb?

01:30:37.874 --> 01:30:39.763
ASHLY: Caleb's gone.

01:30:39.763 --> 01:30:41.239
MARISHA: He's dead.

01:30:41.239 --> 01:30:44.168
ASHLY: Who's the next in command when Caleb's not
around?

01:30:44.168 --> 01:30:53.713
[cheering]

01:30:53.713 --> 01:30:59.580
MARISHA: You know, Keg, I feel like we don't need
a man's approval for a plan, necessarily.

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:04.367
[cheering]

01:31:04.367 --> 01:31:07.329
MARISHA: I think this is a pretty solid fucking
plan.

01:31:07.329 --> 01:31:08.588
ASHLY: What's the solid plan?

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:11.621
MARISHA: I don't have a plan!

01:31:11.621 --> 01:31:22.219
LIAM: In Beauregard's ear, she hears: I am in the
hallway ahead of you. Chill out for a moment. I

01:31:22.219 --> 01:31:26.664
will continue to let Frumpkin creep around, if we
are in that sort of a scenario.

01:31:26.664 --> 01:31:36.661
MATT: At the moment, this is more of a chase
sequence, as you guys are going after them. In

01:31:36.661 --> 01:31:42.748
this order, as we progress, next up in the order
would be Caduceus. Caduceus, what are you doing?

01:31:42.748 --> 01:31:47.584
TALIESIN: I'm going to send my insects further
down after them.

01:31:47.584 --> 01:31:50.039
LIAM: Bugs. The show's all about bugs now. Bugs.

01:31:50.039 --> 01:31:54.007
MARISHA: I'll hold my action in case I see
anything, by the way, with my turn, if that's

01:31:54.007 --> 01:32:02.820
okay. Oh! Can I move in? I want to move in. I was
talking to everybody. Mm-hmm. That's good.

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:10.946
TALIESIN: I'm going to push to the far corner of
the hallway and take a look down to see if I see

01:32:10.946 --> 01:32:16.090
anything. As far as I can get.

01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:19.336
MATT: You don't quite get that far. The
invisibility lasts until the end of your next

01:32:19.336 --> 01:32:21.685
turn? The invisibility that you get?

01:32:21.685 --> 01:32:24.136
TALIESIN: Oh, then now it's over.

01:32:24.136 --> 01:32:27.161
LIAM: As you pass in the hallway, you hear
lightly: Entschuldigung.

01:32:27.161 --> 01:32:30.065
TALIESIN: Hey. Cool.

01:32:32.845 --> 01:32:46.592
MATT: All righty. As Frumpkin creeps around the
corner, the last thing that Frumpkin sees in this

01:32:46.793 --> 01:32:52.663
area is another cage that is closed and locked,
and another humanoid figure that is slumped

01:32:52.663 --> 01:32:58.573
inside, gagged and bound, chains, manacles behind
the back, and similar to the other captives being

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:05.662
held. There is a doorway that one of the higher
guards is closing behind him, and for a brief

01:33:05.662 --> 01:33:13.923
glimpse, you see Protto and Ruzza further in the
chamber with a torch light source within the next

01:33:13.923 --> 01:33:18.895
room before the door closes.

01:33:18.895 --> 01:33:28.548
LIAM: If I am able to now, I will send Frumpkin
over the ceiling and down the door, and if there

01:33:28.548 --> 01:33:32.336
is a crack, he will go through.

01:33:32.336 --> 01:33:34.894
MATT: Are the rest of you moving in further to the
next chamber?

01:33:34.894 --> 01:33:39.308
SAM: Sure, yeah, if there's no threat. I'll scan
for traps as I walk.

01:33:39.308 --> 01:33:42.140
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:54.504
SAM: Yeah, motherfucker! 24! Best rolls of my
life!

01:33:54.504 --> 01:34:00.652
MATT: As you turn around the corner, you can see
the beetles swarm and Frumpkin both making their

01:34:00.652 --> 01:34:04.977
way towards the bottom of the door as the rest of
your friends are coming along. You look down and

01:34:04.977 --> 01:34:13.545
the generally pretty rough-hewn stone flooring
that most of these lower chambers entail, the step

01:34:13.545 --> 01:34:19.224
right in front of the closed door behind them
seems to have a grooved pattern in it that is

01:34:19.224 --> 01:34:21.724
mostly filled with dust and dirt.

01:34:21.724 --> 01:34:25.384
[cheering]

01:34:25.384 --> 01:34:39.568
SAM: I am the greatest rogue alive! I will go try
and disarm that trap. Well, with my Mage Hand.

01:34:39.568 --> 01:34:42.237
MATT: Go ahead and attempt to do so.

01:34:42.237 --> 01:34:44.004
SAM: It's plus seven?

01:34:44.004 --> 01:34:46.493
MATT: It's plus your dexterity modifier and your
proficiency modifier.

01:34:46.493 --> 01:34:48.685
SAM: 20 even.

01:34:48.685 --> 01:34:51.510
ASHLY: Nice!

01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:57.058
MATT: You manage to get the Mage Hand beneath, and
at a quick glance, you can see this is not a

01:34:57.058 --> 01:35:01.247
mechanical contraption more than it's an
enchantment on the piece of stone itself.

01:35:01.247 --> 01:35:02.881
SAM: Oh. So I can't disarm it.

01:35:02.881 --> 01:35:06.831
MATT: What you do is the Mage Hand runs itself
around the outskirts of it, pulling up the dust

01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:10.856
and dirt that has settled in to have it blend in
with the rest of the stone, curling beneath, and

01:35:10.856 --> 01:35:17.542
pops it up, and causes it to fold up a bit, lift
out the stone tablet, and drift it off to the side

01:35:17.542 --> 01:35:24.063
and set it down. The trap is still armed, but that
part of the floor has now been moved out of the way.

01:35:24.456 --> 01:35:34.890
SAM: So we can step over, around it? Yes! Wow!
Caleb! Are you right next to me? No.

01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:39.506
LIAM: No.

01:35:39.762 --> 01:35:41.380
MATT: You're sending Frumpkin into the next
chamber?

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.192
LIAM: Ja. If there's a gap, ja.

01:35:43.192 --> 01:35:47.041
MATT: There is a slight gap. Roll a stealth check
for Frumpkin this time.

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:50.067
LIAM: Frumpkin's not invisible, is he?

01:35:50.067 --> 01:35:52.804
MATT: No. He's a spider.

01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:56.962
LIAM: Good news. I rolled a one.

01:35:58.631 --> 01:36:10.328
MATT: Frumpkin curls beneath the door frame,
revealing this other hired guard that was back

01:36:10.328 --> 01:36:17.410
further in the chamber. Protto and Ruzza, they've
lifted another barred trap door that guards

01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:21.382
another set of stairs that goes deeper below into
another chamber.

01:36:21.382 --> 01:36:22.744
SAM: A dungeon in a dungeon?

01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:26.812
MATT: They're stepping further down into this next
bit, at which point Protto looks over his shoulder

01:36:26.812 --> 01:36:36.512
and goes, "Hurry!" (arrow firing) No, he gets an
attack before you can pull him back. That's a 16

01:36:36.512 --> 01:36:39.443
plus six; that's a 24.

01:36:39.443 --> 01:36:41.537
SAM: Maybe it's only one point of damage!

01:36:41.537 --> 01:36:43.356
MATT: That is 11 points of piercing damage.

01:36:43.356 --> 01:36:48.145
SAM: (groaning)

01:36:49.706 --> 01:36:58.569
MATT: A rapid-fired arrow about that long, I'd
say, against a spider would look terrible if it

01:36:58.569 --> 01:37:04.641
wasn't a fey entity that dissipates into dust as
it blinks back into its home dimension.

01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:08.128
LIAM: They. Are. Going. To. Die.

01:37:08.128 --> 01:37:16.074
[cheering]

01:37:16.074 --> 01:37:18.152
MATT: How long does your beetle swarm last?

01:37:18.152 --> 01:37:20.632
TALIESIN: A minute.

01:37:20.632 --> 01:37:26.446
MATT: Okay. It probably only has a few more, maybe
ten, 15 more seconds before it fades.

01:37:26.446 --> 01:37:28.769
ASHLY: Can we have followed behind at this point?

01:37:28.769 --> 01:37:31.293
MATT: You guys could've followed and got to the
next chamber behind them, if you want.

01:37:31.293 --> 01:37:33.808
ASHLY: Can we say that we did that?

01:37:33.808 --> 01:37:35.878
MARISHA: Yeah, can we all convene in this room?

01:37:35.878 --> 01:37:37.256
MATT: You may.

01:37:37.256 --> 01:37:40.649
MARISHA: Before we do anything else.

01:37:40.649 --> 01:37:42.663
KHARY: Can I bring my Spiritual Weapon with me?

01:37:42.663 --> 01:37:43.384
MATT: You may.

01:37:43.384 --> 01:37:46.136
KHARY: As ineffectual as she's been.

01:37:46.136 --> 01:37:47.286
MATT: She's tried, though.

01:37:47.286 --> 01:37:48.608
KHARY: She's tried.

01:37:48.608 --> 01:37:53.069
MATT: As Nefertiti floats in behind Shakäste as
you're stepping inside, the spell begins to blink

01:37:53.069 --> 01:37:56.894
out, running its course.

01:37:56.894 --> 01:38:01.185
KHARY: You tried, baby.

01:38:01.185 --> 01:38:05.543
MATT: You see now, there is the unconscious
humanoid--

01:38:05.543 --> 01:38:08.523
ASHLY: Aw.

01:38:08.523 --> 01:38:11.504
MATT: The unconscious humanoid figure in the cage
before you, and the closed door where they all

01:38:11.504 --> 01:38:19.217
vanished behind, and you hear (clanging) Sounds
like some sort of metal object or slab has fallen

01:38:19.217 --> 01:38:23.885
solid onto flat ground.

01:38:23.885 --> 01:38:28.851
LIAM: I start moving up through the hallway.
Nott-- ja, it's still me, I'm still invisible.

01:38:28.851 --> 01:38:31.984
You need to check that door. I don't know if it's
trapped or--

01:38:31.984 --> 01:38:35.451
SAM: Which door? The door that I just checked or
the next door?

01:38:35.451 --> 01:38:37.858
LIAM: You checked a trap in this room, didn't
you?

01:38:37.858 --> 01:38:40.972
SAM: In the hallway that leads to the first
chamber.

01:38:40.972 --> 01:38:42.236
MARISHA: What about this door?

01:38:42.236 --> 01:38:45.091
LIAM: Frumpkin went under a new door.

01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:50.708
SAM: You know about more rooms than I do. I just
checked the door in the front of the first room.

01:38:50.708 --> 01:38:53.425
MATT: You checked for traps right there, and there
was a trap on the floor right in front of that

01:38:53.668 --> 01:38:58.164
doorway. You disabled it, moved it out of the way,
and now you guys are looking at the door.

01:38:58.164 --> 01:39:02.038
LIAM: I point invisibly and say: The door that I'm
pointing at! That one!

01:39:02.038 --> 01:39:10.842
SAM: I don't see-- I don't know what you're
saying. Waft your smell in the direction that--

01:39:10.842 --> 01:39:14.508
LIAM: A gentle knock happens on the door in front
of her.

01:39:14.508 --> 01:39:16.933
SAM: Is that the door that I checked? No? Yes?

01:39:16.933 --> 01:39:20.239
MATT: You didn't check the door, you checked the
room for traps, and that was the trap you saw.

01:39:20.239 --> 01:39:25.721
SAM: Oh, the door! The door, okay. I'll check the
door. Why don't you check the cage for these fellows?

01:39:26.135 --> 01:39:28.939
KHARY: I was just thinking the same thing.

01:39:28.939 --> 01:39:31.908
SAM: That's a 17 on investigation.

01:39:31.908 --> 01:39:35.043
MATT: The door does not appear to be trapped. It
is locked, however, from the other side.

01:39:35.043 --> 01:39:37.488
LIAM: The other side?

01:39:37.488 --> 01:39:43.018
MARISHA: I'll help search the room as well. I'll
look for any other triggers or passageways.

01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:47.883
ASHLY: Any objections to me trying to chop this
door down? Is it made of wood? I should ask first.

01:39:48.202 --> 01:39:52.848
MATT: It is made of wood. It has some metal
framing to it, but it's wooden primarily.

01:39:52.848 --> 01:39:56.378
LIAM: Ja, I would prefer it. We are blown
anyway, so have at it.

01:39:56.378 --> 01:39:57.879
ASHLY: All right, here we go!

01:39:57.879 --> 01:39:59.036
SAM: Wait, what about these people in the cage?

01:39:59.036 --> 01:40:03.277
KHARY: Yeah, I was thinking, maybe can I
investigate these people that are in the cage?

01:40:03.277 --> 01:40:09.020
MATT: Yeah. You walk up to it, and there are the
two people, the small child and the dwarf, in the

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:13.022
previous chamber where you were locked, and in the
chamber you just discovered there appears to be an

01:40:13.022 --> 01:40:18.800
older gentleman in his maybe late fifties, early
sixties or so. Looks pretty bruised up; one eye is

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.883
swollen shut, the other looks pretty bloodied as
well. He's chained from behind and has the gag in

01:40:24.883 --> 01:40:27.701
his mouth, as well.

01:40:27.701 --> 01:40:34.809
KHARY: Can I at least get in to move close enough
that I could get the gag out of his mouth?

01:40:34.809 --> 01:40:42.392
MATT: Yeah. You go ahead and pull it free--
"(gasping, panting) Who are you?"

01:40:42.392 --> 01:40:50.097
KHARY: We're friends. We're going to get you out
of here. How are the bindings on your hands?

01:40:50.097 --> 01:40:58.678
MATT: "They hurt." You can see he looks weak. He
probably hasn't eaten well in a number of days. As

01:40:58.678 --> 01:41:05.912
part of the process of mentally conditioning those
they capture, it's minimal sustenance and a lot of

01:41:05.912 --> 01:41:11.877
mental and psychological damage, as well as
physical torture to go along with it. You've seen

01:41:11.877 --> 01:41:17.595
and endured some of it, but looks like some of
these other figures have gone through more of it.

01:41:17.595 --> 01:41:25.057
MARISHA: I have one goodberry left over from Nila
that she gave me that I didn't eat. So I'm going

01:41:25.057 --> 01:41:28.181
to hand him the goodberry--

01:41:28.181 --> 01:41:29.430
MATT: Well, his hands are bound.

01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:33.190
MARISHA: I'm going to feed him the goodberry.

01:41:33.190 --> 01:41:40.775
MATT: He looks at you with his one semi-good eye,
and, "What-- What are-- What are you-- Why?"

01:41:40.775 --> 01:41:43.086
MARISHA: What, you don't like berries?

01:41:43.086 --> 01:41:45.859
SAM: (shouting) Just eat the berry!

01:41:45.859 --> 01:41:48.941
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:54.739
SAM: Eight.

01:41:54.739 --> 01:41:56.977
MATT: He looks at you-- "(sobbing)"

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:58.588
SAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

01:41:58.588 --> 01:42:05.382
MATT: "(sobbing) Aah," and just sadly eats the
berry.

01:42:05.382 --> 01:42:08.388
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:10.393
MATT: "Okay, it's not too bad."

01:42:10.393 --> 01:42:12.991
MARISHA: Antioxidants, you know.

01:42:12.991 --> 01:42:14.818
MATT: "Açaí."

01:42:14.818 --> 01:42:16.778
KHARY: What's your name, friend?

01:42:16.778 --> 01:42:18.326
MATT: "Jusca."

01:42:18.326 --> 01:42:19.818
KHARY: Jusca.

01:42:19.818 --> 01:42:24.787
MATT: "I'm just a farmer, I don't know why they
took me." He pulls against the constraints from

01:42:24.787 --> 01:42:27.727
behind. "Can you get me out? Can you get me out,
please?"

01:42:27.727 --> 01:42:32.382
LIAM: We are just giving them time to be ready for
us. We need to proceed.

01:42:32.382 --> 01:42:36.566
ASHLY: Yeah, we need to move. Sorry about your
ears, grandpa! Then I smack the door with my hammer.

01:42:36.849 --> 01:42:38.130
MATT: All right, make an attack roll.

01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:39.885
SAM: You're the worst person.

01:42:39.885 --> 01:42:42.887
ASHLY: (laughing) I am, I'm sorry. The door, with
my axe.

01:42:42.887 --> 01:42:44.685
MATT: Door, yeah. Make an attack roll for the
door.

01:42:44.685 --> 01:42:47.175
ASHLY: That's a 20. Not a natural, just a--

01:42:47.175 --> 01:42:48.923
MATT: Yeah, no; that hits. Go ahead, roll damage.

01:42:48.923 --> 01:42:49.961
ASHLY: Okay.

01:42:49.961 --> 01:42:52.350
SAM: I'm going to use Mage Hand to unbind his
hands.

01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:53.863
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll dexterity.

01:42:53.863 --> 01:42:55.455
KHARY: Oh, nice.

01:42:55.455 --> 01:42:58.122
ASHLY: That's an eight.

01:42:58.122 --> 01:42:59.463
SAM: (whispering) 14.

01:42:59.463 --> 01:43:03.642
MATT: 14? It takes you a little bit, but you do
manage to get the manacles off the back of his

01:43:03.642 --> 01:43:04.858
body. You rolled a?

01:43:04.858 --> 01:43:06.216
ASHLY: An eight. Damage.

01:43:06.216 --> 01:43:09.576
MATT: An eight. As you come down with your
battleaxe, you all hear the resounding (crash) as

01:43:09.576 --> 01:43:14.039
it slams into the wood, splintering and breaking
it a bit. You can see a brief gap where you've

01:43:14.039 --> 01:43:17.026
managed to get two of the wooden boards to
separate and start to splinter. You're starting to

01:43:17.026 --> 01:43:22.824
go full Shining on this door. With that impact,
over the next moment, with repeated hits, you

01:43:22.824 --> 01:43:26.009
definitely can see your ability to cut through
this.

01:43:26.009 --> 01:43:28.513
ASHLY: Okay. Can I do it again--? Can I get
through?

01:43:28.513 --> 01:43:33.781
MATT: Yeah. As that's happening, the bindings are
now freed, and Jusca brings his wrists up and rubs

01:43:33.781 --> 01:43:38.927
them. You can see where the strain has caused red,
bloodied lines across from the tension where he's

01:43:38.927 --> 01:43:48.780
pulled against the restraints. Sallow, this
long-bearded chin out of neglect. He looks up with

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:54.531
a faint glimmer of hope and a smile to the rest of
you, and says "Oh, tha-- thank you."

01:43:54.531 --> 01:43:56.041
KHARY: He's still in the cage--

01:43:56.041 --> 01:43:56.972
MATT: Still in the cage, yes.

01:43:56.972 --> 01:43:58.116
KHARY: Still locked in the cage?

01:43:58.116 --> 01:43:58.749
MATT: Yeah.

01:43:58.749 --> 01:44:00.079
KHARY: Should I try to unlock that thing?

01:44:00.079 --> 01:44:12.287
MATT: Go for it. Roll a d20. Plus your dex bonus,
and your proficiency bonus. It'd be plus... six, I think?

01:44:12.287 --> 01:44:13.756
KHARY: Six? So 17.

01:44:13.756 --> 01:44:18.019
MATT: 17.It's going to take you a bit. You're
starting to get through it, but these cages are

01:44:18.019 --> 01:44:22.349
designed to be hard to pick. You take the better
part of a minute to do so. In the meantime, you--

01:44:22.349 --> 01:44:28.571
ASHLY: So Matt? Hypothetically, if I rolled a
critical failure trying to go Shining on the door,

01:44:28.571 --> 01:44:30.085
what would happen?

01:44:30.085 --> 01:44:31.736
TALIESIN: It would be very us.

01:44:31.736 --> 01:44:33.825
SAM: Intermission.

01:44:33.825 --> 01:44:35.376
ASHLY: In theory.

01:44:35.376 --> 01:44:41.034
MATT: In theory, your axe goes wide, and as
opposed to hitting the actual wood manages to

01:44:41.034 --> 01:44:46.535
catch a heavy part of the metal reinforcement on
the door frame. As it hits, that heavy impact

01:44:46.535 --> 01:44:49.795
sends reverberations through your arm and body,
like the worst--

01:44:49.795 --> 01:44:52.429
SAM: Tinnitus?

01:44:52.429 --> 01:45:01.299
MATT: Tennis elbow you've ever felt. At that
minute, a voice, familiar, creeps in again in the

01:45:01.299 --> 01:45:10.377
space around you. "What are you planning to
accomplish? You've killed a few bottom-barrel

01:45:10.377 --> 01:45:18.810
"goons, but you're in my domain now. I had first
planned to make you into premium contraband when

01:45:18.810 --> 01:45:29.414
"finished. However, I may just keep you all as my
own personal pets." Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:45:29.414 --> 01:45:30.428
SAM: Ugh.

01:45:30.428 --> 01:45:33.447
LIAM: Caleb is silently making the jerk-off motion
in the room they are standing in.

01:45:33.447 --> 01:45:38.626
[cheering]

01:45:38.626 --> 01:45:40.589
LIAM: Let's get this door open.

01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:41.930
ASHLY: I have to make a saving throw, Matt?

01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:43.583
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw, please.

01:45:43.583 --> 01:45:45.096
MARISHA: Oh, no!

01:45:45.096 --> 01:45:47.352
SAM: You've got this.

01:45:47.352 --> 01:45:50.502
ASHLY: Come on, baby; character development! 15?

01:45:50.502 --> 01:46:01.430
MATT: 15? Okay. In the moment, the sense of
intimidation that your previous employer, Lorenzo,

01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:06.081
had held over you, and all the memories of what
transpired on the Glory Run Road not but a day

01:46:06.081 --> 01:46:12.028
before goes running through your mind, and you
feel that cold sense of fear, that urge to run

01:46:12.028 --> 01:46:17.334
creep up once more. And you close your eyes
tightly and shrug it off. For the first time in

01:46:17.334 --> 01:46:18.848
the face of this--

01:46:18.848 --> 01:46:24.232
[cheering]

01:46:24.232 --> 01:46:30.285
MATT: That driving surge of vengeful confidence
beginning to burn in your belly once more.

01:46:30.285 --> 01:46:39.301
ASHLY: I just got a little teary-eyed. And I say:
Eat shit, fucko! Then I go for the door again.

01:46:39.301 --> 01:46:43.835
That is a 20 on the door.

01:46:43.835 --> 01:46:49.622
MATT: With your second swipe, you bring both your
battleaxe and your warhammer together in one giant

01:46:49.622 --> 01:46:55.841
swing, both splintering the wood, and the force of
the hammer splintering and breaking the two main

01:46:55.841 --> 01:47:00.626
heavy wooden boards that hold the majority of the
right side of the door by where the hinges hold it

01:47:00.626 --> 01:47:07.976
on. As you break through, the door breaks on the
top side, and then swings open, the apparatus

01:47:07.976 --> 01:47:13.294
which keeps it there, wedged in that door, broken
partway and now rendered pretty much useless. The

01:47:13.294 --> 01:47:21.727
chamber in front of you is now left open for you
all to see where the three members, both Protto,

01:47:21.727 --> 01:47:27.542
Ruzza, and the third thug have vanished from the
chamber. You see a table on the far end and a

01:47:27.542 --> 01:47:34.920
brazier burning with a low flame, and then the
stairway below has a set of bars, like another

01:47:35.153 --> 01:47:39.989
trap door that is a gate that seems to have closed
and locked behind them.

01:47:39.989 --> 01:47:45.822
KHARY: I like your fire, Keg.

01:47:45.822 --> 01:47:53.422
ASHLY: (panting) Thanks. I'm going through some
shit. Can we get this gate open?

01:47:53.422 --> 01:47:55.357
LIAM: Maybe. Nott, will you have a look at it
first?

01:47:55.357 --> 01:47:59.496
SAM: Sure. How you doing over there, Shakäste,
with the gates-- the cage?

01:47:59.496 --> 01:48:00.932
KHARY: I think I'm almost there.

01:48:00.932 --> 01:48:05.615
MATT: All right. At this point, Shakäste, you do
manage to finally get the final tumbler of this

01:48:05.615 --> 01:48:11.712
one lock to-- (tumblers clicking, creaking) It
opens up, and with that the older gentleman steps

01:48:11.712 --> 01:48:17.354
out, takes one step towards you, and
half-collapses into your arms. He's drained of

01:48:17.354 --> 01:48:19.988
energy. (thump)

01:48:19.988 --> 01:48:22.562
SAM: But that goodberry...

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:26.394
KHARY: Yeah, that's the only berry you got.

01:48:26.394 --> 01:48:28.010
MARISHA: Electrolytes...

01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:30.793
MATT: He rights himself. He's not unconscious, he
just kind of stumbles and then gets back up and

01:48:30.793 --> 01:48:33.176
leans against the wall, breathing heavily.

01:48:33.176 --> 01:48:40.713
KHARY: Right. There are a couple of people that
are in the chamber around the corner here that are

01:48:40.713 --> 01:48:47.124
also trapped. How are you with a lockpick?

01:48:47.124 --> 01:48:51.921
SAM: (laughs) We're deputizing the guy we just
freed?

01:48:51.921 --> 01:48:54.258
KHARY: You know-- Hey man.

01:48:54.258 --> 01:48:59.404
MATT: He looks at you for about ten seconds,
blinking the one eye he can blink--

01:48:59.404 --> 01:49:01.798
KHARY: Never mind. Never mind. Thanks for--

01:49:01.798 --> 01:49:04.800
MATT: "I-- I make radishes grow."

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:10.907
[laughter]

01:49:10.907 --> 01:49:13.224
SAM: We'll come back for them! We'll come back for
them.

01:49:13.224 --> 01:49:19.721
KHARY: Yeah. I say, You know what? Go to the
chamber around the corner, stay there with the

01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:25.705
people who are there-- who are caged. We're going
to let you all free in a bit, but we've got some

01:49:25.705 --> 01:49:29.999
business we've got to take care of. We're going to
make sure these people don't do this again.

01:49:29.999 --> 01:49:31.493
MATT: "Okay."

01:49:31.493 --> 01:49:36.222
MARISHA: I say, Hey. When was the last time you've
seen Lorenzo? Did he go this way? Has he come back?

01:49:36.635 --> 01:49:45.702
MATT: "Sorry. I haven't noticed. I'm sorry. I try
not to make eye contact. They don't like it when I do."

01:49:45.702 --> 01:49:54.743
SAM: Did you see a blue tiefling or a green,
sort-of-gradient-colored half-orc, and maybe an

01:49:54.743 --> 01:50:00.020
amazing-looking white and sort-of, kind-of-black,
dark angel thing?

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:08.043
MATT: He looks to you, first kind of still taken
aback by the goblin face, and the sharpened teeth,

01:50:08.043 --> 01:50:13.330
and the yellow eyes staring back. But he calms
himself. "Uh, I think those were the new projects

01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:15.090
"he took below."

01:50:15.090 --> 01:50:21.433
SAM: Projects? I don't like that--

01:50:21.433 --> 01:50:22.571
ASHLY: We've got to move.

01:50:22.571 --> 01:50:27.265
LIAM: Caleb is already in the next room, steering
clear of the trap and trying to inspect if that

01:50:27.265 --> 01:50:31.554
brazier is arcane in nature, or if there is
anything dangerous other than the trap.

01:50:31.554 --> 01:50:32.824
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:50:32.824 --> 01:50:33.511
LIAM: Ja.

01:50:33.511 --> 01:50:36.498
MARISHA: While he does that, I'm going to go
immediately for the gate and look at that, into

01:50:36.498 --> 01:50:39.268
the stairs, and see what the deal is.

01:50:39.268 --> 01:50:41.337
SAM: Are you looking for traps or anything, or
just looking?

01:50:41.337 --> 01:50:44.623
MARISHA: I'm going to investigate it and see how I
can potentially open it if it's locked, yeah.

01:50:44.623 --> 01:50:51.239
MATT: All right, so Beau. As you approach the gate
and go to look towards it, the brazier flame flickers.

01:50:51.239 --> 01:50:54.943
MARISHA: I jump back.

01:50:54.943 --> 01:50:58.892
MATT: You do, just as a gout of flame juts out in
your direction--

01:50:58.892 --> 01:51:01.587
SAM: Aah!

01:51:01.587 --> 01:51:04.940
LIAM: If only I had gotten to say natural 20
before that happened.

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:07.603
MATT: Well, you realize what it is just as it
happens, and you're like "Oh!--"

01:51:07.603 --> 01:51:10.962
LIAM: Oh, that's one of those--

01:51:10.962 --> 01:51:17.976
MATT: (whoosh) A cone of flame just bursts forward
from the brazier in your direction. I need you to

01:51:17.976 --> 01:51:21.819
make a dexterity saving throw, please.

01:51:21.819 --> 01:51:29.330
MARISHA: Oh. I rolled a two. So nine.

01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:34.990
MATT: You take ten points of fire damage as it
just incinerates past you. And you take a step

01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:40.293
back, and the flame is now super small. Like it
just expended a lot of its fire energy. In the

01:51:40.293 --> 01:51:44.235
brazier it's just this low flicker. And it begins
to burn brighter again--

01:51:44.235 --> 01:51:47.952
MARISHA: Aah! While it's going, I'm going to see
if I can yank open the thing!

01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:51.460
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength
check.

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:52.932
MARISHA: (whining) Can I do athletics?

01:51:52.932 --> 01:51:54.373
[laughter]

01:51:54.373 --> 01:51:57.052
MATT: This is a straight strength check
unfortunately, sorry.

01:51:57.052 --> 01:51:59.184
SAM: Um, I'd prefer a nature check?

01:51:59.184 --> 01:52:01.709
MATT: Just roll a d20, add your--

01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:02.955
MARISHA: (singing) Don't fuck me...

01:52:02.955 --> 01:52:04.906
MARISHA and AUDIENCE: Gil!

01:52:04.906 --> 01:52:07.355
MARISHA: Mm, 15!

01:52:07.355 --> 01:52:08.090
MATT: 15?

01:52:08.090 --> 01:52:09.173
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:52:09.173 --> 01:52:13.759
MATT: (creaking) It begins to bend. You can see
now where they've left it to lock behind, it

01:52:13.759 --> 01:52:17.467
latches when it's dropped. And where the latch has
stuck in, it's been locked underneath. It's

01:52:17.467 --> 01:52:21.224
starting to pull apart. The metal is bending. It's
not strong enough to break; it will take another

01:52:21.224 --> 01:52:23.458
round to do so, but it's starting to give.

01:52:23.458 --> 01:52:25.695
ASHLY: I'm going to rush forward and help. Do the
same thing.

01:52:25.695 --> 01:52:27.041
MATT: All right.

01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:31.356
LIAM: And am I aware of that the trap? What sets
it off, since I got the natural 20?

01:52:31.356 --> 01:52:32.964
MATT: Yes: proximity.

01:52:32.964 --> 01:52:34.957
LIAM: Proximity alone?

01:52:34.957 --> 01:52:38.600
ASHLY: Um... (nervous laugh)

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:39.849
MATT: So, go ahead and make a strength check.

01:52:39.849 --> 01:52:41.161
MARISHA: (grunting)

01:52:41.161 --> 01:52:41.896
ASHLY: Okay.

01:52:41.896 --> 01:52:43.021
MARISHA: I'm still trying to help!

01:52:43.021 --> 01:52:44.106
ASHLY: 21!

01:52:44.106 --> 01:52:49.894
MATT: 21. Beau, as you're pulling, your muscles
getting sore that the veins bulging in your arms

01:52:49.894 --> 01:52:51.945
and your neck as you're yanking as hard as you
can.

01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:53.911
MARISHA: (grunting) Keg, do I look buff?

01:52:53.911 --> 01:52:55.807
ASHLY: (grunting) Yeah! Yeah you look great!

01:52:55.807 --> 01:52:56.781
MARISHA: (grunting) Thank you!

01:52:56.781 --> 01:52:58.838
MATT: Keg joins in with you and both of you--
Ping!

01:52:58.838 --> 01:52:59.991
ASHLY: Do I look buff?

01:52:59.991 --> 01:53:04.705
MATT: The latches break off and it slides open,
hitting the back wall, leaving the stairs below

01:53:04.705 --> 01:53:08.429
open. This warm air is billowing up from beneath,
at which point I need both of you to make a

01:53:08.429 --> 01:53:14.842
dexterity saving throw as the brazier now has
regained its flame and then (whoosh) sends forth.

01:53:14.842 --> 01:53:15.976
Another blast.

01:53:15.976 --> 01:53:17.150
ASHLY: 19.

01:53:17.150 --> 01:53:18.496
MARISHA: 12.

01:53:18.496 --> 01:53:24.890
MATT: All right, so you succeed. Beau,
unfortunately you do not. So that's going to be 12

01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:28.999
points of fire damage to you, Beau. Six points to
you.

01:53:28.999 --> 01:53:30.376
ASHLY: Aah, I still get burned!

01:53:30.376 --> 01:53:35.538
MATT: You take half damage though. And you watch
as the flame now turns to a small cinder and

01:53:35.538 --> 01:53:40.940
begins to (rumble) rise once more, regenerating
its flame power.

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:45.789
SAM: Is it-- the brazier, it's in the wall? It's
inside the wall?

01:53:45.789 --> 01:53:51.798
MATT: There is a stone bowl of some kind that is
in a small pedestal that looks decorative on the

01:53:51.798 --> 01:53:57.095
corner that contains a small ember. But the ember
itself seems to be magical, and whenever anybody

01:53:57.095 --> 01:54:00.994
walks within a certain distance of it, it just
sends a gout of flame in their direction.

01:54:00.994 --> 01:54:05.162
SAM: Can I Mage Hand grab it and throw the bowl
across the room?

01:54:05.162 --> 01:54:08.933
MATT: Well first off, you both are in proximity;
you have the stairs below, what are you doing?

01:54:08.933 --> 01:54:10.392
ASHLY: Are we dexing it down, right?

01:54:10.392 --> 01:54:11.833
MARISHA: We drop down.

01:54:11.833 --> 01:54:18.700
MATT: All right, both Beau and Keg vanish down the
stairs. Just as the flames (roar) over the

01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:23.239
direction they were, but it passes overhead
without any harm. You've managed to pull out of

01:54:23.239 --> 01:54:26.984
the range of this brazier. Nott.

01:54:26.984 --> 01:54:28.493
SAM: That looks like a big bowl. I don't know.

01:54:28.493 --> 01:54:29.382
MATT: It's pretty large.

01:54:29.382 --> 01:54:30.329
SAM: I don't think I can lift that.

01:54:30.329 --> 01:54:33.774
MATT: And it looks like the stone bowl itself is
probably built into the pillar, it would weigh far

01:54:33.774 --> 01:54:35.943
too much for your Mage Hand to move.

01:54:35.943 --> 01:54:44.392
SAM: How do we get down there without the fire
thing happening again? Ah, oh. Wait, Caleb,

01:54:44.392 --> 01:54:45.600
are you in the room?

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:53.286
LIAM: I am in the room. There are a couple of
options. I could dispel it; It would take me about

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:57.102
ten minutes. I would no longer be invisible, we
would lose time.

01:54:57.102 --> 01:54:58.422
SAM: Ten minutes? No!

01:54:58.422 --> 01:55:00.500
LIAM: The second option is that we just run for
it.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:05.188
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, if that's the options...
I'm just going to just tap my staff and cast

01:55:05.188 --> 01:55:06.736
Dispel at third level.

01:55:06.736 --> 01:55:07.981
LIAM: Yes!

01:55:07.981 --> 01:55:10.324
[cheering]

01:55:10.324 --> 01:55:12.690
SAM: Wait, what is it, what are you doing? Dispel?
You can do Dispel?

01:55:12.690 --> 01:55:13.239
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:55:13.239 --> 01:55:14.872
SAM: What can't you do?

01:55:14.872 --> 01:55:16.739
TALIESIN: It's a second level spell, right?

01:55:16.739 --> 01:55:19.991
SAM: Why weren't you always playing this
character?

01:55:19.991 --> 01:55:23.031
MATT: Dispel Magic-- Dispel Magic is third level.

01:55:23.031 --> 01:55:23.575
TALIESIN: What?

01:55:23.575 --> 01:55:24.579
MATT: Dispel Magic is third level.

01:55:24.579 --> 01:55:28.329
TALIESIN: Third level, all right. So, I'll cast
that.

01:55:28.329 --> 01:55:33.086
MATT: All right, you watch as the flame blinks out
and is left dark--

01:55:33.086 --> 01:55:36.114
[cheering]

01:55:36.114 --> 01:55:42.392
MATT: Flameless. Just a pile of blackened ash and
whatever source of this enchantment is rent useless.

01:55:42.392 --> 01:55:44.085
SAM: Good job, Caleb!

01:55:44.085 --> 01:55:45.193
ASHLY: We should have waited.

01:55:45.193 --> 01:55:47.038
(laughter)

01:55:47.038 --> 01:55:54.699
LIAM: There is a deep, deep sigh in the room, and
then Caleb descends into the hole.

01:55:54.699 --> 01:55:59.201
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, if they just asked I
would've-- I don't know. Okay.

01:55:59.201 --> 01:56:01.322
MATT: So you all continue down the stairs after
your friends.

01:56:01.322 --> 01:56:02.482
SAM: Let's go, yes!

01:56:02.482 --> 01:56:03.339
TALIESIN: Sure.

01:56:03.339 --> 01:56:04.425
LIAM: Ja.

01:56:04.425 --> 01:56:06.501
KHARY: Yeah. The Duchess perches on my shoulder.

01:56:06.501 --> 01:56:14.088
MATT: (humming) Just stops there. Wings tucked up,
long beak, breathing really fast. (panting)

01:56:14.088 --> 01:56:15.891
KHARY: Keep a sharp eye, darling.

01:56:15.891 --> 01:56:21.392
MARISHA: As Deuces and Shakäste come down the
stairs, I say: Does this look bad to you?

01:56:21.392 --> 01:56:22.699
KHARY: Ugh.

01:56:22.699 --> 01:56:25.994
MARISHA: And I show them my scorched, really burnt
arm, because it hurts real bad.

01:56:25.994 --> 01:56:29.096
KHARY: It doesn't look good.

01:56:29.096 --> 01:56:30.829
TALIESIN: That doesn't look that good.

01:56:30.829 --> 01:56:34.113
KHARY: Yeah. Is there anything I can do to help
you right now?

01:56:34.113 --> 01:56:37.178
MARISHA: Yeah, that was kind of my question. I
just didn't want to ask outright.

01:56:37.178 --> 01:56:40.177
SAM: She's very passive-aggressive.

01:56:40.177 --> 01:56:40.899
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:56:40.899 --> 01:56:42.703
(laughter)

01:56:42.703 --> 01:56:45.320
ASHLY: I have a potion if you need it, Beau.

01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.474
SAM: You have two potions, don't you?

01:56:46.474 --> 01:56:47.362
MARISHA: Uh...

01:56:47.362 --> 01:56:48.534
ASHLY: I have two.

01:56:48.534 --> 01:56:50.201
MARISHA: Eh...

01:56:50.201 --> 01:56:51.717
(laughter)

01:56:51.717 --> 01:56:52.883
ASHLY: Do you want it?

01:56:52.883 --> 01:56:55.028
MARISHA: Hang on. Let's wait for the--

01:56:55.028 --> 01:56:57.487
SAM: For the clerics to weigh in?

01:56:57.487 --> 01:57:01.793
MARISHA: For the healers-- The clerics to finish
their council.

01:57:01.793 --> 01:57:05.583
KHARY: I say suck it up buttercup. I'll take care
of you later.

01:57:05.583 --> 01:57:10.963
[hooting and laughter]

01:57:10.963 --> 01:57:13.124
MARISHA: But Shakäste, I got you that nice arrow.

01:57:13.124 --> 01:57:14.704
ASHLY: Do you want it now?

01:57:14.704 --> 01:57:15.932
MARISHA: Yeah, now I want it.

01:57:15.932 --> 01:57:17.805
ASHLY: Yeah, okay.

01:57:17.805 --> 01:57:19.329
ASHLY: It's a greater healing potion.

01:57:19.329 --> 01:57:23.003
MATT: So, greater healing potion, so that's 4d4
plus 4.

01:57:23.003 --> 01:57:24.751
SAM: Whoa! You have two of those?

01:57:24.751 --> 01:57:25.896
ASHLY: Yeah baby.

01:57:25.896 --> 01:57:26.832
SAM: Damn!

01:57:26.832 --> 01:57:27.776
ASHLY: Aw yeah, baby!

01:57:27.776 --> 01:57:28.888
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

01:57:28.888 --> 01:57:30.549
SAM: Oh, man! Smoking is great.

01:57:30.549 --> 01:57:33.078
(laughter)

01:57:33.078 --> 01:57:35.695
ASHLY: Kids, you heard it here.

01:57:35.695 --> 01:57:37.506
LIAM: Oh, good roll.

01:57:37.506 --> 01:57:39.561
MATT: So 14.

01:57:39.561 --> 01:57:40.974
MARISHA: Thank you! 14 points.

01:57:40.974 --> 01:57:41.732
SAM: That's great.

01:57:41.732 --> 01:57:43.991
TALIESIN: That's very good.

01:57:43.991 --> 01:57:51.804
LIAM: Shakäste, would you, er-- Friend, would you
do us the favor of... Stacy-- Is it Stacy or Anastasia?

01:57:51.804 --> 01:57:53.209
KHARY: It's Anastasia, baby.

01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:56.942
LIAM: Okay. I used to have a cat. I do not any
longer--

01:57:56.942 --> 01:57:59.244
AUDIENCE: Aw!

01:57:59.244 --> 01:58:03.984
LIAM: Would you do us the favor of having a peek
around with your bird, friend?

01:58:03.984 --> 01:58:10.283
KHARY: That sounds like a lovely idea. Grand
Duchess, if you wouldn't mind taking a peek?

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:15.298
MATT: As you all begin to prepare the continuing
descent, the stairs only travel down about 25 or

01:58:15.298 --> 01:58:22.793
so feet before a low, red-lit chamber, and steps
that go on beyond. So you have a view down to

01:58:22.793 --> 01:58:28.418
where the base is. The Duchess begins to coast
down towards that space. That's where we're going

01:58:28.418 --> 01:58:29.604
to take a break.

01:58:29.604 --> 01:58:30.537
SAM: Ugh!

01:58:30.537 --> 01:58:35.405
[applause]

01:58:35.405 --> 01:58:38.233
MARISHA: Lorenzo has a red room!

01:58:38.233 --> 01:58:41.412
SAM: How long is this break, Matt? What is this,
ten minutes? 12 minutes? How--

01:58:41.412 --> 01:58:46.176
MATT: About 15 minute break. We'll be back here in
just a moment, guys. For those who are watching

01:58:46.176 --> 01:58:50.191
and you want to go ahead and be part of the
Wyrmwood giveaway, head over to the Critical Role

01:58:50.191 --> 01:58:56.520
Twitch channel at twitch.tv/criticalrole, enter
the code word: GenCon. G-E-N-C-O-N, one word.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:00.188
We'll come back with the winner's name at the end
of the break. We'll see you here in 15 minutes.

01:59:00.188 --> 01:59:02.022
SAM: Everyone check out the D&amp;amp;D Beyond booth!

01:59:02.022 --> 01:59:02.935
KHARY: Stretch your legs; hydrate!

01:59:03.177 --> 01:59:04.360
SAM: We got this.

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:07.997
MATT: All righty. Are we back?

01:59:07.997 --> 01:59:11.740
ASHLY: We look back.

01:59:12.722 --> 01:59:15.096
MATT: We good? All right. We on?

01:59:15.096 --> 01:59:16.549
MARISHA: I think we're back.

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:18.600
MATT: All righty, welcome back everyone.

01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:20.669
MARISHA: We're back.

01:59:20.669 --> 01:59:23.311
MATT: Do we have a winner from the giveaway?

01:59:23.311 --> 01:59:26.225
TALIESIN: Are we back online again?

01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:33.476
MATT: I think we're back on the stream. I have not
been given a winner. All right, we'll get it done

01:59:33.476 --> 01:59:38.109
in chat. Whoever won, congratulations. You'll find
out soon.

01:59:38.109 --> 01:59:39.345
SAM: Are we on the internet right now?

01:59:39.345 --> 01:59:40.011
MATT: I think we are.

01:59:40.011 --> 01:59:41.014
SAM: We're on?

01:59:41.014 --> 01:59:43.651
MATT: We're on. We're live.

01:59:43.651 --> 01:59:47.591
[cheering]

01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:54.435
MATT: All righty. Bringing us back in, getting the
music going.

01:59:54.435 --> 01:59:56.427
ASHLY: I just got so nervous.

01:59:56.427 --> 02:00:00.721
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh god.

02:00:00.721 --> 02:00:03.424
ASHLY: Oh god.

02:00:03.424 --> 02:00:07.496
MATT: Any other preparation you guys want to do
before you descend the stairs?

02:00:07.998 --> 02:00:14.676
KHARY: I would like to render Aid to three friends
of mine.

02:00:14.676 --> 02:00:16.130
SAM: You'd like to what?

02:00:16.130 --> 02:00:24.251
KHARY: I have an Aid spell that before we go into
the fray, I believe these two beautiful ladies

02:00:24.251 --> 02:00:33.196
have been taking a lot of the brunt of damage and
deserve a little something extra. So I say they

02:00:33.196 --> 02:00:34.479
take Aid--

02:00:34.479 --> 02:00:35.969
MATT: 2nd-level? The base level?

02:00:35.969 --> 02:00:38.083
KHARY: Level two.

02:00:38.083 --> 02:00:43.997
MATT: All righty, yeah. So that's five temporary--
sorry, your hit point maximum increases by five

02:00:43.997 --> 02:00:48.691
for the next eight hours for Beau, Keg, and who else?

02:00:48.691 --> 02:00:50.901
KHARY: I think I'll give it to myself as well.

02:00:50.901 --> 02:00:55.761
MATT: There you go. So that's five more maximum
hit points, and you gain five hit points.

02:00:56.210 --> 02:00:57.044
ASHLY: And we gain five hit points?

02:00:57.044 --> 02:00:59.104
MATT: Yeah, with that.

02:00:59.104 --> 02:01:01.102
TALIESIN: So are you both healed now?

02:01:01.102 --> 02:01:03.202
ASHLY: Ish.

02:01:03.202 --> 02:01:04.778
MARISHA: I have 41 hit points.

02:01:04.778 --> 02:01:05.513
ASHLY: 46.

02:01:05.513 --> 02:01:08.104
MARISHA: Out of now 51.

02:01:08.104 --> 02:01:14.678
TALIESIN: I'll throw a Cure Wounds at each of you.
Just to get that out of the way.

02:01:14.678 --> 02:01:15.966
MARISHA: Deuces.

02:01:15.966 --> 02:01:26.589
TALIESIN: Here we go. That's (counting) 12 points
to you, and ten points to you.

02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:27.898
ASHLY: Hell yeah. Thank you.

02:01:27.898 --> 02:01:31.487
TALIESIN: And that's all my 1st-level spell slots.
That's cool.

02:01:31.487 --> 02:01:35.249
KHARY: Couple of tanks up in here.

02:01:35.249 --> 02:01:48.197
MATT: The Duchess heads down into the chamber, and
it opens into a T-shaped chamber facing your

02:01:48.197 --> 02:02:05.105
direction. The stairs here descend down into this
area. The room is low-lit with a red glow

02:02:05.105 --> 02:02:12.846
emanating from two furnaces, one on each side
there with faint red embers and bits of ash that

02:02:12.846 --> 02:02:15.426
flicker out with small bits of flame.

02:02:15.426 --> 02:02:19.774
KHARY: Now I don't want my baby to go too far,
okay? Just let her see what's--

02:02:19.774 --> 02:02:21.250
MATT: Hovering right there?

02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:28.703
KHARY: I'd say yeah. Just enough to stay in the
shadow.

02:02:28.703 --> 02:02:35.645
MATT: All right, make a stealth check for your
Duchess. Roll a d20, add two.

02:02:35.645 --> 02:02:38.179
MARISHA: Aw, buddy.

02:02:40.369 --> 02:02:41.343
KHARY: One.

02:02:44.343 --> 02:02:52.335
MATT: Duchess perches right in the middle of the
floor, right there. She's sitting right there. You

02:02:52.571 --> 02:02:58.320
think Duchess is hidden. What else do you guys
do?

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:05.390
KHARY: Well, here's the thing. If she's sitting
right there in the middle, can she see better than

02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:07.097
if she were in the shadow?

02:03:07.097 --> 02:03:11.962
MATT: From looking inside and seeing some of the
chamber-- I'll give you a little more of a view of

02:03:11.962 --> 02:03:13.240
what's inside.

02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:18.297
MARISHA: Silver linings!

02:03:18.297 --> 02:03:24.484
MATT: There's this unnatural heat that fills the
interior of this chamber. The air smells of coal

02:03:24.759 --> 02:03:26.564
and burnt flesh.

02:03:26.564 --> 02:03:29.272
SAM: The map looks like a cock and balls!

02:03:29.272 --> 02:03:36.238
[laughter, cheering]

02:03:36.238 --> 02:03:38.888
LIAM: Spoilers!

02:03:38.888 --> 02:03:41.923
MATT: Hopefully not, proportionally. That'd be a
little sad.

02:03:41.923 --> 02:03:44.979
SAM: Have you seen me? You can see me.

02:03:44.979 --> 02:03:48.956
KHARY: From what I've heard, you know, it's all
about girth, so.

02:03:48.956 --> 02:03:52.120
LIAM: Scanlan's gone, man. Scanlan's gone.

02:03:56.030 --> 02:04:02.101
MATT: You can see a number of metal brands hanging
against some of the walls, where they are carried

02:04:02.402 --> 02:04:06.999
over to these furnaces to be heated as torture
implements. Further into the central chamber you

02:04:06.999 --> 02:04:14.783
see a table. You see, in the middle of this
rounded chamber, flanked by empty chairs, this

02:04:14.783 --> 02:04:23.953
stained, stretch leather-topped table, leather
draping over on each side almost to the floor. You

02:04:23.953 --> 02:04:29.181
see heavy chains dangling at the front and the
back of it, as this is probably a location where

02:04:29.181 --> 02:04:37.320
individuals are strapped to and tortured. Two sets
of prison barred doors flank the opposite ends

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:43.698
that seem to have larger containment chambers
beyond there. They look to be heavy and very

02:04:43.698 --> 02:04:49.378
locked and barred. What would you like to do?

02:04:53.608 --> 02:04:58.567
KHARY: I'd like for the Duchess to come back and
perch on my shoulder, frankly.

02:04:58.567 --> 02:05:02.439
MATT: Okay, Duchess heads back up.

02:05:02.439 --> 02:05:06.286
ASHLY: Well, it's not like they don't know we're
coming.

02:05:06.937 --> 02:05:15.882
SAM: So we are inside the-- we've lifted open the
hatch, right? There's no other doors going down to

02:05:15.882 --> 02:05:17.827
the downstairs, right? That's it.

02:05:17.827 --> 02:05:22.497
MATT: This currently looks to be the only
continued path downward, yes.

02:05:22.497 --> 02:05:27.289
LIAM: Are the stairs wide enough for two people to
go down? Three people to go down?

02:05:27.289 --> 02:05:28.015
MATT: Individual.

02:05:28.015 --> 02:05:30.385
LIAM: Individual. That blows.

02:05:30.385 --> 02:05:33.736
KHARY: They're hiding, they're waiting.

02:05:33.736 --> 02:05:35.077
ASHLY: I can go first.

02:05:35.077 --> 02:05:43.396
SAM: Wait, no! Caleb is invisible. I mean, I don't
want to lose you, but--

02:05:46.686 --> 02:05:47.672
LIAM: Ja.

02:05:47.672 --> 02:05:50.935
SAM: And you're noisy af.

02:05:50.935 --> 02:05:55.870
ASHLY: Well, they know we're coming. This isn't
going to be a surprise attack, I'm assuming.

02:05:56.570 --> 02:06:02.588
MARISHA: Do you think they would grant you the
graces that they did before and spare you if they

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:03.235
saw you?

02:06:03.235 --> 02:06:08.038
ASHLY: Now? I don't think so.

02:06:08.038 --> 02:06:09.845
KHARY: Have they seen you?

02:06:09.845 --> 02:06:10.918
ASHLY: Yeah.

02:06:10.918 --> 02:06:17.375
MARISHA: Oh, Shakäste! There's a really long
story.

02:06:17.375 --> 02:06:19.859
KHARY: That's all right, you can tell me later.

02:06:19.859 --> 02:06:21.656
MARISHA: She used to work for them.

02:06:21.656 --> 02:06:23.238
ASHLY: But not anymore!

02:06:23.238 --> 02:06:29.617
KHARY: Not anymore. Right. But have they seen you
since you've changed your affiliations?

02:06:29.617 --> 02:06:30.456
ASHLY: Yes.

02:06:30.456 --> 02:06:32.683
KHARY: Well then, never mind.

02:06:32.683 --> 02:06:39.044
SAM: What if this-- they know you, right, Keg? You
could say, "All right, I'm coming down, Lorenzo!"

02:06:39.488 --> 02:06:41.480
ASHLY: Is that what you think I sound like?

02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:46.483
SAM: I'm a pretty good-- I'm like Rich Little.

02:06:46.483 --> 02:06:50.915
ASHLY: Are you as good at impression as you are a
detective?

02:06:50.915 --> 02:06:52.814
SAM: Then I could send--

02:06:52.814 --> 02:07:00.380
KHARY: Sidebar, Rich Little was an impressionist
from the 70s and 80s, kids. Thank you.

02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:07.458
SAM: I could send down an image of you that looks
like you, and so if they attack right away they'll

02:07:07.458 --> 02:07:10.815
be fighting against just an illusion!

02:07:10.815 --> 02:07:15.297
ASHLY: That's not a bad idea.

02:07:15.297 --> 02:07:16.790
SAM: Thank you.

02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:19.526
ASHLY: Thanks, Nott. What do we think about that?

02:07:19.526 --> 02:07:21.538
LIAM: That's a pretty impressive illusion--

02:07:21.538 --> 02:07:27.387
KHARY: I like the idea of sussing them out, since
they're obviously hiding down there. Because from

02:07:27.387 --> 02:07:31.079
what the Duchess saw, she saw the chamber, but no
one was in it.

02:07:31.079 --> 02:07:31.896
MARISHA: I agree.

02:07:31.896 --> 02:07:33.845
LIAM: You are able to do something so
substantial?

02:07:33.845 --> 02:07:40.121
SAM: Not of substance, if that's what you mean by
substantial. Wherever you are.

02:07:40.121 --> 02:07:42.332
LIAM: I'm right in front of you.

02:07:42.332 --> 02:07:43.374
SAM: Okay.

02:07:43.374 --> 02:07:45.074
LIAM: I'm right in front of you. I'm talking
about--

02:07:45.074 --> 02:07:45.880
SAM: (kiss)

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:52.172
(laughter)

02:07:52.172 --> 02:07:59.552
SAM: I think I got an ear. I can do something that
goes down and looks like Keg?

02:07:59.552 --> 02:08:01.033
LIAM: As big as Keg?

02:08:01.033 --> 02:08:03.760
SAM: As big as Keg, yes. Keg's not very big.

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:05.540
MARISHA: It can't make noise though, right?

02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:08.910
SAM: Well, she'll make the noise. I'll make the
video.

02:08:08.910 --> 02:08:12.151
MARISHA: Oh, we're going to do a ventriloquist
act.

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:13.282
SAM: Yeah.

02:08:13.282 --> 02:08:14.173
MARISHA: Okay.

02:08:14.173 --> 02:08:15.335
ASHLY: Can you do that?

02:08:15.335 --> 02:08:17.384
SAM: I can try-- I can certainly try!

02:08:17.384 --> 02:08:24.689
[cheering]

02:08:24.689 --> 02:08:30.501
SAM: But you know, that's step one. Step two is
much different, because then what if they come out

02:08:30.501 --> 02:08:32.219
and attack? Then what do we do?

02:08:32.219 --> 02:08:36.315
MARISHA: Well, last thing that we want is for them
to have the element of surprise on us.

02:08:36.315 --> 02:08:36.918
SAM: Ah, okay.

02:08:36.918 --> 02:08:40.041
MARISHA: So as long as we can get them out.

02:08:40.536 --> 02:08:41.614
SAM: Okay. Will I try?

02:08:41.614 --> 02:08:45.286
MARISHA: It's going to suck either way, and I
don't want to die, but we might die.

02:08:45.286 --> 02:08:46.167
SAM: Okay.

02:08:46.167 --> 02:08:54.188
ASHLY: So am I pretending to try and be stealthy?
Am I going: Yo fuckface? Like, what's the vibe?

02:08:54.188 --> 02:08:57.199
SAM: I mean the second thing is more you.

02:08:57.199 --> 02:09:01.409
ASHLY: That's true. I mean, trying to be stealthy
and failing is also very me.

02:09:01.409 --> 02:09:02.331
SAM: That's true.

02:09:02.331 --> 02:09:06.780
MARISHA: What was that thing you said earlier?
Fucko? What was that?

02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:08.265
ASHLY: Oh. Eat shit, fucko.

02:09:08.265 --> 02:09:09.778
MARISHA: I liked that.

02:09:09.778 --> 02:09:10.815
ASHLY: Aw, thanks!

02:09:10.815 --> 02:09:12.354
MARISHA: That feels solid.

02:09:12.354 --> 02:09:14.791
ASHLY: I was thinking about it for a while, like
if I ever saw him again--

02:09:14.791 --> 02:09:15.346
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:09:15.346 --> 02:09:16.829
ASHLY: I'd be like: Eat shit, fucko.

02:09:16.829 --> 02:09:17.987
MARISHA: I'm glad you workshopped it.

02:09:17.987 --> 02:09:18.839
ASHLY: It felt pretty good when I did it.

02:09:18.839 --> 02:09:21.650
MARISHA: Never throw out your first draft. You
know, never show that.

02:09:21.650 --> 02:09:22.790
ASHLY: I was working on that for a while.

02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:24.687
MARISHA: That's great. That's good. I admire
that.

02:09:24.687 --> 02:09:29.434
SAM: But, you know if you see him again, though,
you can't go back to old material. You need some--

02:09:29.434 --> 02:09:34.072
ASHLY: That's why I was thinking fuckface. Well,
is fuckface a step down from fucko?

02:09:34.072 --> 02:09:35.059
SAM: Fuckface is different.

02:09:35.059 --> 02:09:36.545
ASHLY: I mean it's in the same range, I guess.

02:09:36.545 --> 02:09:37.437
MARISHA: That's true.

02:09:37.437 --> 02:09:38.620
ASHLY: What would you say?

02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:44.013
SAM: I would say: Eat shit, you rusty spoon! I
don't know.

02:09:44.013 --> 02:09:46.110
ASHLY: You rusty spoon?

02:09:46.110 --> 02:09:48.479
MARISHA: You're deviating though, from the brand,
you know?

02:09:48.479 --> 02:09:51.620
SAM: Oh, you know he doesn't have any hair. Maybe
you could be like: Baldy McGee!

02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:53.940
ASHLY: Aw baldy! You fucking chrome dome.

02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:54.611
SAM: Yeah!

02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:56.687
MARISHA: Fucking chrome dome! Nailed it.

02:09:56.687 --> 02:09:59.442
SAM: Making fun of someone's appearance is very
good.

02:09:59.442 --> 02:10:01.531
MARISHA: Works every time.

02:10:01.531 --> 02:10:02.857
ASHLY: That'll really get him.

02:10:02.857 --> 02:10:03.644
SAM: Yeah!

02:10:03.644 --> 02:10:04.948
ASHLY: Nothing will get him except that.

02:10:04.948 --> 02:10:05.642
SAM: Yeah!

02:10:05.642 --> 02:10:10.185
ASHLY: I'm coming down-- an illusion of me is
coming down the stairs. I'm going to try and

02:10:10.185 --> 02:10:13.198
ventriloquist the illusion to say, Hey chrome
dome--

02:10:13.198 --> 02:10:13.999
SAM: Uh huh.

02:10:13.999 --> 02:10:15.539
ASHLY: This is going to go great. Let's do it.

02:10:15.539 --> 02:10:16.907
MARISHA: Hey, fucking chrome dome.

02:10:16.907 --> 02:10:17.971
ASHLY: Hey, fucking chrome dome!

02:10:17.971 --> 02:10:18.564
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:10:18.564 --> 02:10:20.481
LIAM: What are we doing?

02:10:20.481 --> 02:10:23.548
MARISHA: We're workshopping a bit.

02:10:23.548 --> 02:10:29.396
SAM: We're drawing them out, and then once we know
their position, I guess we'll just run and gun?

02:10:29.396 --> 02:10:32.729
LIAM: Let's stop making so much noise and try it,
then.

02:10:32.729 --> 02:10:33.134
SAM: Okay.

02:10:33.134 --> 02:10:33.968
ASHLY: Let's do it.

02:10:33.968 --> 02:10:40.356
SAM: All right, so you start with an, "I'm coming
down," or something and then you'll "come down."

02:10:40.356 --> 02:10:46.120
ASHLY: Okay. Should I do the chrome dome line?
That's what we're going with? We workshopped it a

02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:46.569
little bit.

02:10:46.569 --> 02:10:47.841
KHARY: I like the chrome dome line.

02:10:47.841 --> 02:10:48.312
ASHLY: Okay.

02:10:48.312 --> 02:10:49.749
TALIESIN: You worked so hard on it.

02:10:49.749 --> 02:10:51.735
MARISHA: Could be on the movie poster. It's great.

02:10:51.735 --> 02:10:56.515
ASHLY: So Keg shouts down, "Hey, you fucking chrome
dome!"

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:57.689
TALIESIN: Language.

02:10:57.689 --> 02:10:59.083
MARISHA: Nailed it.

02:10:59.083 --> 02:11:05.169
SAM: I drop a bit of fleece and cast Silent Image
and make Keg walking down the steps.

02:11:05.169 --> 02:11:10.464
MATT: All right, you watch as this quiet,
soundless image of Keg--

02:11:10.804 --> 02:11:11.860
ASHLY: I'll go like this!

02:11:11.860 --> 02:11:13.061
SAM: Rattle! Rattle! Rattle!

02:11:13.061 --> 02:11:14.543
ASHLY: Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

02:11:14.543 --> 02:11:15.881
SAM: It's a radio play!

02:11:15.881 --> 02:11:20.994
TALIESIN: I'm going to use a little Thaumaturgy to
make sure it's actually got some noise to it. I'll

02:11:20.994 --> 02:11:21.916
puppet it a little bit.

02:11:21.916 --> 02:11:24.304
SAM: Ooh! With coconuts you can make it sound like
horses!

02:11:24.304 --> 02:11:27.319
TALIESIN: I don't have a coconut. I--

02:11:27.319 --> 02:11:30.081
ASHLY: I think we're mixing. I think the streams
are crossing.

02:11:33.221 --> 02:11:35.524
TALIESIN: So yeah, I'm going to give it a little
bit of sound.

02:11:35.524 --> 02:11:37.208
ASHLY: It worked super well right?

02:11:37.208 --> 02:11:40.312
KHARY: You got two husks and you're smacking them
together.

02:11:40.312 --> 02:11:41.452
ASHLY: I'm clanging down.

02:11:41.452 --> 02:11:42.532
MATT: You're making the clanging sound.

02:11:42.532 --> 02:11:44.214
ASHLY: Illusion Keg is clanging down.

02:11:44.214 --> 02:11:46.020
MATT: Make a performance check.

02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:48.233
SAM: Wait, me or her?

02:11:48.233 --> 02:11:49.629
LIAM: Come on, Burch!

02:11:49.629 --> 02:11:50.930
MATT: Her.

02:11:51.378 --> 02:11:52.059
MARISHA: Come on!

02:11:52.059 --> 02:11:54.027
ASHLY: (singing) Hello my baby, hello my darling,
hello my ragtime gal...

02:11:54.027 --> 02:11:56.997
MARISHA and AUDIENCE: Keg! Keg! Keg!

02:11:56.997 --> 02:11:57.921
ASHLY: 11!

02:11:57.921 --> 02:12:00.388
MARISHA: Yay?

02:12:00.388 --> 02:12:02.435
SAM: It's middling.

02:12:02.435 --> 02:12:03.998
MARISHA: Above average.

02:12:03.998 --> 02:12:10.266
MATT: You angle yourself at the top of the
stairway to make sure that the sound of your armor

02:12:10.266 --> 02:12:10.916
shaking--

02:12:10.916 --> 02:12:12.366
ASHLY: What the fuck.

02:12:12.366 --> 02:12:16.850
MATT: At least disseminates into the air as much
as possible. The image can only walk 15 feet,

02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:22.327
because that is the distance of the cube. So the
illusion appears near the top-- or near the middle

02:12:22.327 --> 02:12:23.842
of the stairs--

02:12:23.842 --> 02:12:24.695
KHARY: There's a bit of an echo right?

02:12:24.695 --> 02:12:27.407
MATT: Descends and steps no more than ten feet out
from that and stops.

02:12:27.407 --> 02:12:36.202
SAM: Okay, and starts like, narrowing its eyes and
looking around. Just sort of mean and maybe gets a

02:12:36.202 --> 02:12:43.017
cigarette. I don't know how she has so many of
them. Does she roll them? I don't know.

02:12:43.017 --> 02:12:44.358
ASHLY: It's just the same one.

02:12:44.358 --> 02:12:50.567
MATT: At this moment, you hear (projectiles
firing) and you see as a bit of the dangling

02:12:50.567 --> 02:12:57.224
leather over the table bows slightly. And from the
opposite end, something darts across the hallway.

02:12:57.224 --> 02:12:58.571
SAM: From which side?

02:12:58.571 --> 02:13:04.795
MATT: One appears to emerge from underneath the
table out this way. Another seems to shoot out

02:13:04.795 --> 02:13:05.918
from this side.

02:13:05.918 --> 02:13:08.083
ASHLY: What shoots out?

02:13:08.083 --> 02:13:12.846
KHARY: This is some Indiana Jones shit that's
happening right now.

02:13:12.846 --> 02:13:18.436
SAM: The image of Keg falls to the floor,
clutching her shoulder.

02:13:18.436 --> 02:13:24.903
TALIESIN: I can make it sound-- I'm going to use
Thaumaturgy to make it sound like she's in pain. So--

02:13:25.319 --> 02:13:30.219
ASHLY: (groans) Oh, it hurts!

02:13:30.219 --> 02:13:32.930
TALIESIN: I'm holding the crystal up like a
microphone.

02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:35.114
ASHLY: Aw! Shit!

02:13:35.114 --> 02:13:39.105
TALIESIN: Can you give me, like... three big
deaths, three medium deaths, and three little deaths?

02:13:39.105 --> 02:13:41.858
(laughter)

02:13:41.858 --> 02:13:44.114
LIAM: Oh! Winner!

02:13:44.114 --> 02:13:45.327
(laughter)

02:13:45.327 --> 02:13:48.462
TALIESIN: Some open mouth, closed mouth kind of
shit. I'm just going to need a lot of-- I'm going

02:13:48.462 --> 02:13:49.372
to need a palette to work with.

02:13:49.372 --> 02:13:51.045
ASHLY: Ah! Aw! Agh!

02:13:51.787 --> 02:13:52.898
(laughter)

02:13:52.898 --> 02:14:00.358
MATT: A moment passes before two more (projectiles
fire). These strange, quick objects moving at a

02:14:00.358 --> 02:14:04.940
rapid speed, cross by. Another one hits the bottom
of the stairs and clangs to a rest. This one you

02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:08.895
can actually see it. It appears to be a rather
long, solid crossbow bolt.

02:14:08.895 --> 02:14:12.094
SAM: Okay. I make Keg's hand fall off.

02:14:12.094 --> 02:14:14.613
(laughter)

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:16.317
SAM: Ah, I don't know. I don't know what happened.

02:14:16.317 --> 02:14:17.276
ASHLY: Aw! That was my good hand!

02:14:17.276 --> 02:14:17.997
SAM: Aah!

02:14:17.997 --> 02:14:22.447
MARISHA: Maybe it's a trap. Maybe it's definitely
a trap.

02:14:22.447 --> 02:14:27.320
SAM: Okay, step one went really well. What do we
do now?

02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:31.115
ASHLY: Are there any other crossbolt-y things?

02:14:31.115 --> 02:14:37.217
MARISHA: Nott, can you Mage Hand and lift up the
little leather skirt of the table, and see what's

02:14:37.217 --> 02:14:38.229
under there?

02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:39.992
SAM: This seems a bit far.

02:14:39.992 --> 02:14:45.675
LIAM: It's also-- It's not a trap, is it? Because
there's no weight to your illusion. What would

02:14:45.675 --> 02:14:46.708
have been set off?

02:14:46.708 --> 02:14:48.074
MARISHA: It's motion-sensored.

02:14:48.074 --> 02:14:50.302
SAM: It could be someone under the table.

02:14:50.302 --> 02:14:52.060
KHARY: No, it's not a motion sensor. They see it.

02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:52.814
LIAM: No, it's a person firing.

02:14:52.814 --> 02:14:55.342
KHARY: They see it. There's somebody watching.

02:14:55.403 --> 02:14:56.851
LIAM: It's a person firing.

02:14:56.851 --> 02:14:57.516
SAM: Yes it's someone--

02:14:57.516 --> 02:14:58.385
MARISHA: It's Protto.

02:14:58.385 --> 02:14:59.367
KHARY: Where are those shots coming from?

02:14:59.367 --> 02:15:02.373
SAM: From under the table, and also from somewhere
else.

02:15:02.373 --> 02:15:04.441
MARISHA: Maybe it's Protto and that lackey.

02:15:04.441 --> 02:15:11.514
SAM: Well we know that Protto shoots arrows,
right? And then someone else could be the other one.

02:15:11.815 --> 02:15:13.275
MARISHA: And then they had that hired hand with
them.

02:15:13.275 --> 02:15:14.872
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's them.

02:15:14.872 --> 02:15:17.316
ASHLY: Would we be able to see anything to make
perception checks from here?

02:15:17.316 --> 02:15:20.583
MATT: Not up in the stairway, you'd have to
descend into the actual chamber to see.

02:15:20.583 --> 02:15:21.106
ASHLY: Okay.

02:15:21.106 --> 02:15:27.187
MARISHA: I still got firecrackers. Just throwing
it out there.

02:15:27.187 --> 02:15:28.570
KHARY: There you go. Now we're talking.

02:15:28.570 --> 02:15:29.164
MARISHA: Yeah?

02:15:29.164 --> 02:15:29.842
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:15:29.842 --> 02:15:33.370
MARISHA: I take out a cherry bomb. I light it, I
throw it.

02:15:33.370 --> 02:15:37.921
MATT: (impact, sizzling noises)

02:15:37.921 --> 02:15:41.152
MARISHA: Wait for it... Wait for it.

02:15:41.152 --> 02:15:42.186
MATT: (explosion)

02:15:42.186 --> 02:15:43.743
MARISHA: All right, go! Go! Go!

02:15:43.743 --> 02:15:45.194
SAM: Wait, we're going in?

02:15:45.194 --> 02:15:46.920
MARISHA: Aah!

02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:48.273
MATT: What are you doing?

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:52.269
SAM and MARISHA: Aah!

02:15:54.096 --> 02:15:57.940
SAM: Sure! I'll run down the stairs and I'll fire
as soon as I see anything.

02:15:57.940 --> 02:15:58.733
MATT: All right.

02:15:58.733 --> 02:16:01.029
MARISHA: Do they seem distracted?

02:16:01.029 --> 02:16:04.149
MATT: Nott runs down the stairs. Who's after Nott?

02:16:04.650 --> 02:16:08.724
MARISHA: I'll tumble down the stairs, doing a
barrel roll and some parkour shit.

02:16:08.724 --> 02:16:12.672
MATT: Are you stopping where Nott is? You can move
a little further or elsewhere, wherever you want

02:16:12.672 --> 02:16:13.200
to go.

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:14.440
MARISHA: Can I tuck behind the wall?

02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:15.338
MATT: Over here?

02:16:15.338 --> 02:16:16.663
MARISHA: Yeah, and crouch and peek.

02:16:16.663 --> 02:16:18.470
MATT: Sure. Who else is going where?

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:20.487
ASHLY: I'll do the same. On the opposite wall.

02:16:20.487 --> 02:16:23.570
MATT: Keg you go ahead to the opposite wall?

02:16:23.570 --> 02:16:24.827
ASHLY: Yeah.

02:16:24.827 --> 02:16:26.827
MATT: Yeah, you can get to just about there.

02:16:26.827 --> 02:16:30.987
LIAM: Caleb will come invisibly down, but not
leave the stairs. He will stay on the stairs.

02:16:30.987 --> 02:16:32.474
MATT: About there?

02:16:32.474 --> 02:16:35.213
LIAM: Yeah, halfway down. But you can leave him up
there for the moment.

02:16:35.213 --> 02:16:38.662
MATT: That will give you the basic idea.
Shakäste?

02:16:38.662 --> 02:16:53.420
KHARY: I'm going to stay back, and put the Grand
Duchess over on Keg's shoulder.

02:16:53.420 --> 02:17:00.164
MATT: All right, so the Grand Duchess is currently
residing, we'll say, over here by Keg. That will

02:17:00.164 --> 02:17:01.922
represent he Grand Duchess's current position.

02:17:01.922 --> 02:17:03.057
ASHLY: (whispering) What the fuck?

02:17:03.057 --> 02:17:04.305
MATT: I mean, you're staying back up in the
stairway.

02:17:04.305 --> 02:17:07.373
KHARY: You know what? You had a spider on your
shoulder before; this should feel much better.

02:17:07.373 --> 02:17:08.538
ASHLY: It's all weird.

02:17:08.538 --> 02:17:12.771
MATT: You're staying up behind Caleb, up in the
hallway?

02:17:12.771 --> 02:17:13.276
KHARY: Right.

02:17:13.276 --> 02:17:18.000
MATT: All right, so your vision, with the Duchess
you can see beyond that but you do not have--

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.306
KHARY: A full--

02:17:19.306 --> 02:17:21.648
MATT: The ability to actually hit something unless
you move down below. Just a heads-up.

02:17:21.648 --> 02:17:22.246
KHARY: Right.

02:17:22.246 --> 02:17:23.731
MATT: All right. Caduceus?

02:17:23.731 --> 02:17:27.879
TALIESIN: I think i'm going to-- Oh god-- We don't
want all the magic in one place. That seems like a

02:17:27.879 --> 02:17:35.880
bad idea. I think I'll pull off and hug the wall
to the left and get as far back from that corner

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.033
as I can.

02:17:37.033 --> 02:17:46.942
MATT: All right. (counting) At this moment, make a
perception check, Nott.

02:17:47.311 --> 02:17:47.738
SAM: Me?

02:17:47.738 --> 02:17:49.583
MATT: Yep, as you came down the bottom of the
stairs.

02:17:49.583 --> 02:17:53.948
SAM: 12. Plus nothing, Taliesin.

02:17:53.948 --> 02:17:59.962
MATT: You look down and see the empty chamber. No
movement. Beauregard, you were looking around the

02:17:59.962 --> 02:18:01.500
corner. Make a perception check.

02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:11.200
MARISHA: Oh god! Five. Right? That was a two, plus
three. Five.

02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:14.655
MATT: Keg, you make a perception check as well,
since you're both at the wall.

02:18:14.655 --> 02:18:17.445
ASHLY: Come on, baby. (singing) 20!

02:18:17.445 --> 02:18:25.121
[cheering]

02:18:25.121 --> 02:18:26.635
MARISHA: Thank the gods.

02:18:26.635 --> 02:18:27.931
LIAM: What are you?!

02:18:30.451 --> 02:18:36.448
MATT: Keg, as you hit the wall and glance around
the side, you can see a humanoid shape ducked into

02:18:36.448 --> 02:18:42.094
the shadows underneath the table in the center,
who has pulled a heavy crossbow from underneath

02:18:42.094 --> 02:18:47.915
the leather and aiming it at Nott, which does
attempt to shoot. That is a 17 to hit. What's your

02:18:47.915 --> 02:18:48.471
armor class?

02:18:48.471 --> 02:18:49.453
SAM: It hits!

02:18:49.453 --> 02:18:56.359
MATT: It hits. For that, Nott, you take eight
points of piercing damage as a bolt hits right

02:18:56.359 --> 02:19:01.632
towards the kneecap and actually sticks out the
side, you almost falling to one edge.

02:19:01.632 --> 02:19:04.113
SAM: I will dodge uncannily.

02:19:04.113 --> 02:19:09.629
MATT: There you go. Reduce that to four. Caduceus,
as you walked around the corner, you turn around

02:19:09.629 --> 02:19:15.626
to see and come face to face with Ruzza, who is
back up against the corner, and looks towards you

02:19:15.626 --> 02:19:16.991
and goes, "What the fuck?!"

02:19:16.991 --> 02:19:18.847
TALIESIN: Do I have time to do a thing?

02:19:18.847 --> 02:19:20.155
MATT: No, now we roll initiative.

02:19:23.935 --> 02:19:25.193
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:19:25.193 --> 02:19:36.925
MATT: Unveiling. This guy's down there. Oh god,
Caleb fell. Let's go ahead and do this, guys. You

02:19:37.212 --> 02:19:38.580
guys got a little cluster at the top of the
stairs, goddamn it.

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:40.790
TALIESIN: Oh my god, this is so embarrassing.

02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:43.324
MARISHA: Did you say roll for initiative?

02:19:43.324 --> 02:19:45.850
MATT: Yes. All of you guys.

02:19:45.850 --> 02:19:49.881
SAM: Sorry, Mr. Clay.

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.211
TALIESIN: This is not going to be good.

02:19:51.211 --> 02:19:52.852
LIAM: Do you have a bonus?

02:19:52.852 --> 02:19:56.879
TALIESIN: What do I got as a-- it's bad enough I'm
looking up reactions!

02:19:56.879 --> 02:20:02.915
[groaning sympathetically]

02:20:08.775 --> 02:20:12.151
MATT: We have 25 to 20.

02:20:12.151 --> 02:20:13.752
SAM: 22.

02:20:16.242 --> 02:20:17.711
ASHLY: Okay, okay, okay.

02:20:17.711 --> 02:20:21.344
MATT: 20 to 15.

02:20:21.344 --> 02:20:22.224
LIAM: 15.

02:20:22.224 --> 02:20:23.052
MARISHA: 18.

02:20:23.052 --> 02:20:23.892
ASHLY: 15.

02:20:23.892 --> 02:20:34.524
MATT: We have Beau. Than we have Caleb and Keg
going at the same time. 15 to ten?

02:20:34.524 --> 02:20:35.778
ASHLY: Oh no.

02:20:35.778 --> 02:20:37.754
MATT: No? All righty.

02:20:40.454 --> 02:20:41.983
LIAM: I don't like this music.

02:20:41.983 --> 02:20:43.485
MARISHA: I know, so spooky!

02:20:49.975 --> 02:20:51.741
MATT: Ten to five?

02:20:51.741 --> 02:20:54.401
ASHLY: Taliesin, really? No!

02:20:54.401 --> 02:21:02.464
TALIESIN: Five. I was also supposed to be against
the wall, by the way. There you are, right there.

02:21:02.464 --> 02:21:03.583
Thank you. Five.

02:21:09.053 --> 02:21:10.381
MATT: What did you get, Shakäste?

02:21:10.381 --> 02:21:12.029
KHARY: Four.

02:21:12.029 --> 02:21:33.076
MATT: Ohh. All righty. Oh man! First, with a
natural 20 on initiative order, is Protto. What at

02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:42.384
first you thought was the thug's placement over
there, turns out to be Protto, who immediately

02:21:42.384 --> 02:21:51.854
throws the table up and in front, using it as a
block and as cover, and then aims over again with

02:21:51.854 --> 02:22:03.075
the heavy crossbow, firing once again at Nott.
That's a 23 to hit.

02:22:03.075 --> 02:22:06.058
SAM: That's a very big hit.

02:22:06.058 --> 02:22:09.634
MATT: It's only four piercing damage, however.
Really shitty damage roll.

02:22:09.634 --> 02:22:15.887
SAM: Four piercing damage? Can I also uncanny
dodge that, or no?

02:22:15.887 --> 02:22:22.723
MATT: Yeah, we're going back to the next combat
round. You technically have not gotten your

02:22:22.723 --> 02:22:24.108
reaction yet. So no.

02:22:24.108 --> 02:22:28.746
SAM: You know what? I won't, just in case I want
to react to something else.

02:22:28.746 --> 02:22:33.344
MATT: Well, that finishes Protto's turn. Nott,
you're up.

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:37.822
SAM: Did Protto duck or anything?

02:22:37.822 --> 02:22:42.264
MATT: Yeah, Protto is currently now behind the
table and using it as cover.

02:22:42.264 --> 02:22:45.461
SAM: So I cannot see The Devil Wears Prada?

02:22:45.461 --> 02:22:46.547
MATT: No, you cannot.

02:22:46.547 --> 02:22:48.255
TALIESIN: I was waiting for that.

02:22:48.255 --> 02:22:49.545
MATT: It was only a matter of time.

02:22:49.545 --> 02:22:55.212
SAM: Okay, I will run over to the table, and poke
over it, and shoot Protto.

02:22:55.511 --> 02:23:03.407
[cheering and laughter]

02:23:03.407 --> 02:23:06.829
MATT: As you rush up and glance over you can see
Protto, back against the table--

02:23:06.829 --> 02:23:07.511
SAM: Hello!

02:23:07.511 --> 02:23:09.565
MATT: Pulling and stretching a bolt and goes
"Huh?!"

02:23:09.565 --> 02:23:13.278
MARISHA: Come on! Come on, girl!

02:23:13.278 --> 02:23:14.677
KHARY: Come on!

02:23:14.677 --> 02:23:16.025
SAM: 12.

02:23:16.025 --> 02:23:17.988
MATT: No.

02:23:17.988 --> 02:23:19.532
MARISHA: Aw.

02:23:19.532 --> 02:23:21.533
SAM: I'm going to fuck you up-- Oh, shit!

02:23:21.533 --> 02:23:23.663
(laughter)

02:23:23.663 --> 02:23:26.549
MATT: He instinctually slaps his hand up and it
knocks your arm and it causes the shot to go

02:23:26.549 --> 02:23:28.275
firing off into the distance.

02:23:28.275 --> 02:23:30.279
SAM: I will reload and fire again!

02:23:30.279 --> 02:23:31.662
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:23:31.662 --> 02:23:32.747
SAM: That's 20.

02:23:32.747 --> 02:23:34.812
MATT: That'll hit, that'll hit.

02:23:34.812 --> 02:23:41.658
SAM: Aw, that's cocked. Okay, ten points of
damage.

02:23:42.009 --> 02:23:47.472
MATT: Ten points of damage. This one sinks deep
into the left pectoral muscle of Protto, piercing

02:23:47.472 --> 02:23:53.708
through the armor and then gets stuck. You hear
this expiring bit of air from the throat and he

02:23:53.708 --> 02:23:57.815
seems like he's now having a hard time breathing.
He's hurt, he's not at death's door but he's

02:23:57.815 --> 02:24:00.297
looking pretty hurt. All righty, Nott--

02:24:00.297 --> 02:24:01.385
SAM: I'll duck down.

02:24:01.385 --> 02:24:04.880
MATT: That ends your turn. Beau, you're up.

02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:07.324
MARISHA: Okay!

02:24:07.587 --> 02:24:09.249
SAM: (chanting) B-B-Beau!

02:24:09.249 --> 02:24:16.475
MARISHA: (air horn) I'm going to pop around the
corner. Pop around, and I'm going to go towards

02:24:16.475 --> 02:24:21.241
where Nott is. Keep going. Do I see anybody to my
left?

02:24:21.241 --> 02:24:26.676
MATT: You do, you see the other thug immediately
around that corner, who is also firing from that

02:24:26.676 --> 02:24:27.751
side across the way.

02:24:27.751 --> 02:24:29.634
MARISHA: I go, 'Sup! (pow)

02:24:29.634 --> 02:24:34.280
(laughter)

02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:39.883
MARISHA: Okay, first roll. Natural 20!

02:24:39.883 --> 02:24:49.508
[cheering]

02:24:49.508 --> 02:24:56.587
MARISHA: Doubling the dice damage. Ooh, that's a
seven! So 14 plus four, 18.

02:24:56.587 --> 02:25:05.239
MATT: 18 points of damage to him, nice. All
righty. So with a heavy clock to the side he gets

02:25:05.239 --> 02:25:10.647
thrown back into a torch that is in the wall. That
catches flame a little bit on his shoulder

02:25:10.647 --> 02:25:14.121
and he brushes it out. He is looking both
distracted and pretty hurt.

02:25:14.121 --> 02:25:20.424
MARISHA: That's cool. I'm going to take my off
hand, I'm going to run and just take the edge of

02:25:20.424 --> 02:25:21.752
my arm into his throat.

02:25:21.752 --> 02:25:23.130
MATT: Go for it, second strike.

02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:27.209
MARISHA: Second strike, 14?

02:25:27.209 --> 02:25:29.370
MATT: 14, does hit!

02:25:29.370 --> 02:25:30.711
ASHLY: Oh, yes!

02:25:30.711 --> 02:25:34.102
MATT: Actually, because he is just a lowly guy. He
is not as well armored as his compatriots. So...

02:25:34.102 --> 02:25:36.348
MARISHA: Not great damage: six damage.

02:25:36.348 --> 02:25:41.300
MATT: Six damage. Whack to the throat! (gasping)
He's now having a hard time inhaling. He's still

02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:42.316
standing but--

02:25:42.316 --> 02:25:50.424
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take palm to his nose
and try and bat his head back into that sconce

02:25:50.424 --> 02:25:51.214
behind him.

02:25:51.214 --> 02:25:51.906
SAM: Good god.

02:25:51.906 --> 02:25:52.710
KHARY: Come on girl.

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:58.725
MARISHA: Last hit, last hit. That's not good: 12.

02:25:58.725 --> 02:25:59.671
SAM: That's great!

02:25:59.671 --> 02:26:01.081
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately.

02:26:01.081 --> 02:26:02.334
SAM: Oh, that's not good.

02:26:02.334 --> 02:26:07.207
MATT: You go to hit a third time and he's a little
wiser and manages to push off. It's a sloppy parry

02:26:07.207 --> 02:26:11.588
but he manages to avoid most of the brunt of the
blow and pulls back. That end your turn?

02:26:11.588 --> 02:26:15.936
MARISHA: Yep, I'm going to stay here and just be
on this guy.

02:26:15.936 --> 02:26:20.243
MATT: All right. That brings us to Caleb and Keg.

02:26:20.243 --> 02:26:20.853
ASHLY: Okay.

02:26:20.853 --> 02:26:22.565
MATT: You guys can choose who goes first.

02:26:22.565 --> 02:26:23.311
ASHLY: After you.

02:26:23.311 --> 02:26:25.479
LIAM: Ah, ja, okay. I think--

02:26:25.479 --> 02:26:27.034
ASHLY: Unless, I can go first if you want.

02:26:27.034 --> 02:26:33.389
LIAM: I'm already gone. In my head I think, This
is still going very well. I have not been hit;

02:26:33.672 --> 02:26:38.334
here we go. And I'm at the bottom of the stairs
already, not at the top, so what I would like to

02:26:38.334 --> 02:26:45.507
do is move my full movement and then use my action
to dash. And just stroll to the right of Nott, and

02:26:45.507 --> 02:26:50.856
I will just touch her on the shoulder as I go; and
get as far as I can in that direction against the

02:26:50.856 --> 02:26:54.557
wall, if that's as far as I can get. So 60 feet.

02:26:54.557 --> 02:26:56.703
MATT: You can get all the way over here.

02:26:56.703 --> 02:27:02.113
LIAM: Ja, that's exactly where I want to be. And
then I will scooch down, not fully sitting but

02:27:02.113 --> 02:27:09.863
like bending my knees down and doing like a squat.
And thinking, This is okay. This is okay. That's

02:27:09.863 --> 02:27:10.727
the end of the turn.

02:27:10.727 --> 02:27:11.437
MATT: All right.

02:27:11.437 --> 02:27:12.997
MARISHA: You're in full poop stance?

02:27:12.997 --> 02:27:13.896
ASHLY: So now me?

02:27:13.896 --> 02:27:15.497
SAM: Squatty Potty.

02:27:15.497 --> 02:27:16.240
LIAM: Typically.

02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.713
ASHLY: Can I get to Protto?

02:27:17.713 --> 02:27:28.002
MATT: Protto? (counting) You kick a chair to get
there, but you can get right up against him.

02:27:28.002 --> 02:27:32.576
ASHLY: I say, Hey, little shit! And then I whack
him. That's a natural one.

02:27:32.576 --> 02:27:39.705
MATT: You swing with the battleaxe and it actually
gets wedged into the table. You have to put your

02:27:39.705 --> 02:27:41.926
foot on to manage to free it from the wood.

02:27:41.926 --> 02:27:47.625
ASHLY: All right. Trying again. Okay, that is a
19.

02:27:47.625 --> 02:27:49.608
MATT: 19 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:54.752
ASHLY: Yes. Okay, great. Okay. So that is seven
damage.

02:27:54.752 --> 02:28:00.057
MATT: Seven points of damage to Protto. With the
warhammer, whack! to the side of his head, he's

02:28:00.057 --> 02:28:03.985
pushed up against the side of the now
partially-splintered table, but he is still

02:28:03.985 --> 02:28:07.263
keeping his cool about him. He's hurt, but hanging
in there.

02:28:07.263 --> 02:28:08.566
ASHLY: I can't smack him again with the bonus
action.

02:28:08.566 --> 02:28:09.683
MATT: With your bonus action you can, yeah!

02:28:09.683 --> 02:28:10.699
ASHLY: Oh, well then I'm going to fucking do
that!

02:28:10.699 --> 02:28:12.108
MATT: You're a dual wielder! You got this girl!

02:28:12.108 --> 02:28:16.155
ASHLY: Ah, does that-- 15?

02:28:16.155 --> 02:28:22.812
MATT: Does not. It just misses, unfortunately.
Protto manages to just duck out of the way as your

02:28:22.812 --> 02:28:28.779
hammer slams into the bottom side of the table
where he has been using to break for cover. And it

02:28:28.779 --> 02:28:33.639
causes this huge open hole, this gap, almost like
a porthole in the top of the table where you can

02:28:33.639 --> 02:28:38.090
see through. As you manage to pull back your
hammer he kind of looks up through it right at

02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:39.348
Nott. "Aah!"

02:28:39.348 --> 02:28:40.135
SAM: Aah!

02:28:40.135 --> 02:28:41.616
MATT: That finish your turn Keg?

02:28:41.616 --> 02:28:42.221
ASHLY: Yes.

02:28:42.221 --> 02:28:47.404
MATT: All righty. You now hear once again, a
familiar voice.

02:28:47.404 --> 02:28:50.681
AUDIENCE: No!

02:28:50.681 --> 02:28:52.018
MATT: Crawls from the space that says...

02:28:52.018 --> 02:28:54.103
MARISHA: (quietly) This fucking sucks, right?

02:28:54.103 --> 02:28:56.675
KHARY: (whispering) I hate him.

02:28:56.675 --> 02:29:06.444
MATT: "Do not kill them. They have not earned the
mercy I give to their kaleidoscopic friends. Let

02:29:06.444 --> 02:29:15.159
"them bleed, and bring them in chains. Oh, the
horrors you'll see." And for Lorenzo's turn...

02:29:15.159 --> 02:29:19.113
[jeering]

02:29:19.113 --> 02:29:23.357
SAM: Oh, Lorenzo! He has such good mic technique.

02:29:23.357 --> 02:29:27.347
(laughter)

02:29:27.347 --> 02:29:42.822
MATT: Beau, you hear this momentary vibration of
metal cutting through the air, before-- That is

02:29:43.097 --> 02:29:45.230
going to be a 20 to hit.

02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:46.689
MARISHA: Yep, that hits.

02:29:51.379 --> 02:29:53.925
MATT: That is 17 points of slashing damage.

02:29:53.925 --> 02:29:56.350
AUDIENCE: Oh!

02:29:58.890 --> 02:30:00.184
KHARY: You have Aid.

02:30:00.184 --> 02:30:00.982
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:30:00.982 --> 02:30:03.267
MATT: And 16 to hit.

02:30:03.267 --> 02:30:06.507
MARISHA: Miss! The second one.

02:30:06.507 --> 02:30:15.130
MATT: So the first one strikes from behind. The
pain shoots into your head and the second swing is

02:30:15.328 --> 02:30:23.414
a backhanded, wide throw with this glave, now
seemingly more jagged and almost larger than the

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:30.261
one you saw before. You manage to duck out of the
way and spin around, and there, hovering in the

02:30:30.261 --> 02:30:39.554
air about ten feet off the ground, you see what
seems to be the essence of Lorenzo, but larger.

02:30:39.554 --> 02:30:47.436
You see in that same kind of thickened
leather-studded bits of armor and bracers, a

02:30:47.436 --> 02:30:56.275
bulging, muscular, blue-skinned body. Where once
was a bulging bald head with tattoo, two horns

02:30:56.275 --> 02:31:03.779
emerge from the front. Bits of a blackened beard
on once was a hairless, humanoid form, now curling

02:31:03.779 --> 02:31:10.853
down the front of the chest and back of the head,
one central plume behind. You see there before you

02:31:10.853 --> 02:31:14.330
what is Lorenzo, or at least, his true form.

02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:16.819
SAM AND AUDIENCE: Oh!

02:31:16.819 --> 02:31:30.235
[shouts and jeers]

02:31:30.235 --> 02:31:37.894
MATT: And as you look up into the burning red eyes
of this strange ogreish-like demon creature, which

02:31:37.894 --> 02:31:43.809
you do not recognize, all you hear is the chuckle.
(malicious chuckle)

02:31:50.169 --> 02:31:51.326
SAM: Jesus...

02:31:51.326 --> 02:31:59.831
MATT: As he flies back, further into the chamber,
about 15 feet up, his back to the ceiling of the

02:32:00.082 --> 02:32:08.274
interior, that's going to end Lorenzo's turn. It
is now Ruzza's turn. Ruzza, who saw you first run

02:32:08.274 --> 02:32:22.865
over there, Caduceus, is going attempt to cast
Confusion on you. So I need you, Caduceus, to make

02:32:22.865 --> 02:32:24.939
a wisdom saving throw.

02:32:24.939 --> 02:32:32.080
TALIESIN: A wisdom saving throw. That's a 27.

02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:32.671
ASHLY: Yes!

02:32:32.671 --> 02:32:40.487
[cheering]

02:32:40.487 --> 02:32:47.986
MATT: As you watch Ruzza begin to slightly hum
this incantation there is a musical element that

02:32:48.222 --> 02:32:52.259
is discordant and awful that seems to pierce
through your ears and into your brain. For a

02:32:52.259 --> 02:32:57.291
second your vision blurs, the colors fade to gray.
Up is down, the world makes no sense, and as you

02:32:57.291 --> 02:33:01.516
clasp your eyes tight once more, you manage to
shrug off the magical effect. You look back at

02:33:01.516 --> 02:33:05.688
Ruzza who notices that the spell has faded and
goes, "Oh, shit!"

02:33:05.688 --> 02:33:10.034
TALIESIN: (laughing) Ah.

02:33:10.034 --> 02:33:14.063
KHARY: He hasn't been the same since he left the
Fugees.

02:33:20.463 --> 02:33:24.311
MATT: And Ruzza is going to run the other
direction to try and get away from you. That's

02:33:24.585 --> 02:33:31.262
going to end Ruzza's turn. That brings us now to
the other thug. The one that is up against you.

02:33:31.262 --> 02:33:34.523
MARISHA: Oh, I thought you said the other fuck and
I was like, he is a fuck!

02:33:34.523 --> 02:33:38.280
MATT: You know. That thug is going to--

02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:41.317
MARISHA: Still heard it! Same thing. Keep going.

02:33:41.317 --> 02:33:43.140
MATT: Is going to attempt to move away from you.

02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:43.732
MARISHA: Ah!

02:33:43.732 --> 02:33:46.127
MATT: So take your attack of opportunity.

02:33:46.127 --> 02:33:57.329
MARISHA: Hell yeah. I was going to say: sentinel,
I don't want him getting away. Hm, 15. No 16! 16.

02:33:57.329 --> 02:33:58.793
MATT: 16 will hit, go ahead and roll damage.

02:33:58.793 --> 02:34:04.595
[cheering]

02:34:04.595 --> 02:34:10.324
MARISHA: Yes! All right, not bad. Ten damage and
he is not moving. Bish!

02:34:10.324 --> 02:34:12.747
MATT: No. He is not moving, and he is unconscious.

02:34:12.747 --> 02:34:17.410
[cheering]

02:34:17.410 --> 02:34:22.823
MATT: He's not very good up close, and really
wanted that range and took a gamble and it didn't

02:34:22.823 --> 02:34:28.020
work in his favor. But that's okay. All right,
that finishes his go. Caduceus you're up.

02:34:28.020 --> 02:34:37.308
TALIESIN: All right, let's see what I've got.
Okay... I feel like you're going to be a problem.

02:34:37.308 --> 02:34:45.531
I'm going to cast Blindness. On this beautiful,
beautiful singer.

02:34:45.531 --> 02:34:48.759
MATT: All right, is that a constitution saving
throw?

02:34:48.759 --> 02:34:55.841
TALIESIN: That is a constitution-- let me double
check. Yeah, that's a constitution saving throw

02:34:55.841 --> 02:34:57.042
against 16.

02:34:57.042 --> 02:35:03.082
MATT: Natural 18 plus two, that's a 20.
Unfortunately, no effect.

02:35:03.082 --> 02:35:03.842
TALIESIN: Hmm.

02:35:03.842 --> 02:35:08.516
MATT: You're trading spells, both of you manage to
shrug each other off. It's this massive duel of

02:35:08.516 --> 02:35:09.886
wits and willpower.

02:35:09.886 --> 02:35:12.303
SAM: Damn.

02:35:12.303 --> 02:35:13.626
MATT: Do you wish to move, as well?

02:35:13.626 --> 02:35:16.064
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't die on us!

02:35:16.064 --> 02:35:28.677
TALIESIN: Oh, it's happening. You know, I'm just
going to scoot a little-- No, I'm fine where I am,

02:35:28.677 --> 02:35:31.330
I think. It's just-- Yeah, that's fine.

02:35:31.330 --> 02:35:34.662
MATT: Shakäste. Your turn.

02:35:34.662 --> 02:35:35.777
SAM: Shakäste!

02:35:35.777 --> 02:35:37.036
MARISHA: (whispering) Shakäste!

02:35:37.036 --> 02:35:43.421
KHARY: Well let's see, I have The RZA right here
in front of me, right?

02:35:43.421 --> 02:35:46.238
MATT: You do. Right at the bottom of the stairs.

02:35:46.238 --> 02:35:52.380
KHARY: And I think everybody else is preoccupied
with other people. I think maybe I should take a

02:35:52.380 --> 02:36:05.816
whack at this one. So let's see: we could go
Sacred Flame or we could... I mean, she's standing

02:36:05.816 --> 02:36:07.268
right behind me.

02:36:07.268 --> 02:36:11.128
[cheering]

02:36:11.128 --> 02:36:12.482
SAM: (singing) Titi!

02:36:12.482 --> 02:36:14.393
KHARY: Come on Nefertiti, let's see what you got.

02:36:14.393 --> 02:36:18.222
[cheering]

02:36:18.222 --> 02:36:24.425
MATT: As the form of this Egyptian-- This
incredible ancient Egyptian woman from a world far

02:36:24.425 --> 02:36:30.400
from here apparates on the other side of Ruzza, go
ahead and make your attack roll with a d20.

02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:31.411
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Turn her on!

02:36:31.411 --> 02:36:35.158
KHARY: No, we don't turn her on yet.

02:36:35.158 --> 02:36:37.684
(laughter)

02:36:37.684 --> 02:36:38.815
MATT: Got to get that (engine revving).

02:36:38.815 --> 02:36:40.199
KHARY: So it's...

02:36:40.199 --> 02:36:41.191
MARISHA: Plus seven.

02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:42.527
KHARY: Plus seven, so 11.

02:36:42.527 --> 02:36:43.990
MATT: 11 is not going to hit.

02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:46.703
SAM: Nefertiti! Ugh.

02:36:46.703 --> 02:36:51.608
MATT: That's all right. You still have your action
if you wanted to--

02:36:51.608 --> 02:36:52.474
KHARY: Let's see--

02:36:52.474 --> 02:36:55.450
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sacred Flame!

02:36:55.450 --> 02:36:57.612
TALIESIN: Shh!

02:36:57.612 --> 02:36:59.997
SAM: Whoa, the audience turned.

02:36:59.997 --> 02:37:01.042
MARISHA: I know!

02:37:01.042 --> 02:37:12.930
KHARY: Let's have the Duchess come fly back
towards me and the other side of the chamber. Just

02:37:12.930 --> 02:37:17.177
to make sure that there's nothing-- Yeah, yeah,
further. Yeah, over on that side, just to make

02:37:17.177 --> 02:37:19.687
sure, just because nobody's really investigated
there yet.

02:37:19.687 --> 02:37:24.513
MATT: All right. The Duchess swings over and takes
a look. It looks like this side of the chamber is

02:37:24.513 --> 02:37:26.051
empty. There's nobody else waiting in the wings.

02:37:26.051 --> 02:37:29.402
KHARY: Is that all we've got?

02:37:29.402 --> 02:37:30.594
MATT: Well, you have your action still.

02:37:30.594 --> 02:37:31.738
KHARY: Oh, we've still got an action.

02:37:31.738 --> 02:37:32.686
MATT: And your movement, yeah.

02:37:32.686 --> 02:37:42.556
KHARY: Okay, good. I want to-- let's find our way
towards the Duchess, then. But just halfway there.

02:37:42.556 --> 02:37:47.332
A little further over; not so close to Ruzza.

02:37:47.332 --> 02:37:50.226
MATT: Right, so you can move over that way.

02:37:50.226 --> 02:37:53.152
KHARY: Yeah, back away. Yeah, there you go, that's
more like it.

02:37:53.152 --> 02:37:57.451
MATT: Ruzza does make a swing back with the sword
towards you as you move out of her melee range.

02:37:57.451 --> 02:38:00.853
That's going to be a 14. What's your armor class?

02:38:00.853 --> 02:38:02.317
KHARY: 15.

02:38:02.317 --> 02:38:04.373
MATT: (whoosh)

02:38:04.373 --> 02:38:07.953
KHARY: Can I make a defensive move?

02:38:07.953 --> 02:38:11.317
MATT: It does not actually hit you, though.

02:38:11.317 --> 02:38:16.332
KHARY: Okay, all right. You know what? Be glad,
RZA. Be glad.

02:38:16.332 --> 02:38:19.197
MATT: You do manage to move away from the strike,
no issue, and you still have your action if you

02:38:19.197 --> 02:38:21.447
wanted to use anything else, like a cantrip.

02:38:21.447 --> 02:38:26.341
KHARY: Yeah, let's go Sacred Flame at The RZA.

02:38:26.341 --> 02:38:32.817
MATT: Sacred Flame, that is a natural 18 plus
three on the-- so it does not hit, unfortunately.

02:38:32.817 --> 02:38:37.076
KHARY: Damn. All right. Fuck you, RZA!

02:38:37.076 --> 02:38:43.559
MATT: Guys, keep trading blows and dodging and
keeping it going. Shakäste, that ends your turn.

02:38:43.559 --> 02:38:45.379
Back to the top of the round. It is Protto's
turn.

02:38:45.379 --> 02:38:47.518
MARISHA: This little shit.

02:38:51.338 --> 02:38:53.613
SAM: Are you talking about me?

02:38:57.113 --> 02:39:04.186
MATT: Protto is going to go ahead and drop the
crossbow and pull out two shortswords.

02:39:04.613 --> 02:39:09.127
SAM: Ooh, ugh. Mistake.

02:39:09.127 --> 02:39:18.456
MATT: He's going to spin and dodge very quickly,
quicker than you expected, around you Keg, still

02:39:18.456 --> 02:39:19.761
staying in melee range.

02:39:19.761 --> 02:39:21.490
ASHLY: Do I get an attack of opportunity on him?

02:39:21.490 --> 02:39:24.726
MATT: Does not leave your range, so does not
provoke. He stays close enough, but whips around

02:39:24.726 --> 02:39:30.528
and is going to go ahead and make a strike with
each blade towards you. That is going to be a 12.

02:39:30.528 --> 02:39:32.301
ASHLY: Hell no!

02:39:32.301 --> 02:39:36.537
MATT: It just clangs off your armor, no issue. The
second strike is going to be a 14.

02:39:36.537 --> 02:39:41.232
ASHLY: (cackling)

02:39:41.232 --> 02:39:51.814
MATT: Then, as a-- no, he's just going to leave
that there. That's going to end Protto's turn.

02:39:51.814 --> 02:39:52.817
Nott, you're up.

02:39:52.817 --> 02:39:54.692
SAM: Am I in melee range of Protto?

02:39:54.692 --> 02:39:55.961
MATT: No, you are not.

02:39:55.961 --> 02:40:05.454
SAM: Okay. I am going to run away. Towards
Shakäste, and as I go, I will turn around and fire

02:40:05.454 --> 02:40:11.014
a crossbow bolt at Protto with sneak attack
because--

02:40:11.014 --> 02:40:12.403
MATT: Next to Keg? Go for it.

02:40:12.403 --> 02:40:16.841
SAM: Aw, fuck you! It's only a 12.

02:40:16.841 --> 02:40:20.747
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately. It goes
wide. Scrapes against the stone in the ceiling,

02:40:20.747 --> 02:40:22.398
and ricochets into oblivion.

02:40:22.398 --> 02:40:24.237
SAM: How much more movement do I have?

02:40:24.237 --> 02:40:28.866
MATT: You have quite a bit more movement, but
you'll be coming into melee range with Ruzza. But

02:40:29.222 --> 02:40:32.155
Ruzza cannot make an attack of opportunity against
you because she already took one, so you can keep moving.

02:40:32.155 --> 02:40:37.430
SAM: I'll use my bonus action to fire one more
bolt at that stupid Protto.

02:40:37.430 --> 02:40:38.145
MATT: Go for it.

02:40:38.145 --> 02:40:39.447
SAM: That's a 22 to hit.

02:40:39.447 --> 02:40:41.809
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll damage with
sneak attack.

02:40:41.809 --> 02:40:45.766
SAM: No sneak attack though, right? Matt? No sneak
attack, or--

02:40:45.766 --> 02:40:50.280
MATT: No, sneak attack! Yeah, because Protto's
still next to Keg.

02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:53.524
SAM: Okay, that's 17.

02:40:53.524 --> 02:40:55.578
ASHLY: Wow!

02:40:55.578 --> 02:41:03.776
MATT: Protto's looking pretty hurt as he takes it
right in the abdomen (grunts), and his eyes are

02:41:03.776 --> 02:41:06.069
going wide and (grunting) keeps looking up,
"Boss!"

02:41:06.069 --> 02:41:10.684
SAM: I'll keep moving as far as I can get around
that wall.

02:41:10.684 --> 02:41:15.190
MATT: You get right next to Shakäste, and you're
now right up against the wall, kind of between the

02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:15.964
wall and Shakäste.

02:41:15.964 --> 02:41:16.573
SAM: Great.

02:41:16.573 --> 02:41:19.772
MATT: That ends your turn. That brings us to
Beau.

02:41:19.772 --> 02:41:25.129
MARISHA: Where is Prada? Devil Wears Prada, where
is he?

02:41:25.129 --> 02:41:26.649
MATT: Over there, next to Keg.

02:41:26.649 --> 02:41:29.207
MARISHA: In the white thing?

02:41:29.207 --> 02:41:30.757
MATT: Yeah, right on the opposite side.

02:41:30.757 --> 02:41:31.599
KHARY: Just behind him.

02:41:31.599 --> 02:41:33.437
SAM: End him.

02:41:33.437 --> 02:41:43.680
MARISHA: I'm going to go kill this guy because
he's pissing me off. I'm going to do my movement,

02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:51.031
I'm going to parkour off of the table that he
knocked over, going to use Keg's shoulder to get

02:41:51.031 --> 02:41:52.592
the rest of the way over.

02:41:52.592 --> 02:41:57.353
SAM: I imagine when Beau walks down the street,
it's all parkour.

02:41:57.353 --> 02:42:01.428
MARISHA: Front barrels into the door!

02:42:01.428 --> 02:42:10.101
MATT: As you vault over, pushing that way, the
floating entity that is Lorenzo, who's coasting

02:42:10.101 --> 02:42:16.126
about 15 feet above you, and his wide form, having
a ten-foot range with that glaive-- you just leave

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:21.416
his combat range and he takes a swing of
opportunity towards you. That is going to be a

02:42:21.416 --> 02:42:23.305
seven plus eight, that is a 15 to hit.

02:42:23.305 --> 02:42:24.203
MARISHA: Miss.

02:42:24.203 --> 02:42:28.363
[cheering]

02:42:28.363 --> 02:42:29.383
KHARY: Parkour!

02:42:32.203 --> 02:42:33.646
SAM: She parkours!

02:42:33.646 --> 02:42:42.032
MARISHA: Macy's Day Parade balloon; it's not good
right now. It's bad. Okay, I'm going to unleash on Prada.

02:42:42.551 --> 02:42:45.066
SAM: Yeah, do it!

02:42:45.066 --> 02:42:46.418
MARISHA: Okay, first one.

02:42:46.418 --> 02:42:47.510
ASHLY: Fuck him up.

02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:54.273
MARISHA: Ah, Gil gave me a natural one. (singing)
Fuck you, Gil.

02:42:54.273 --> 02:42:58.764
MATT: You swing towards Protto, Protto ducks out
of the way, and your fist instead hits the edge of

02:42:58.764 --> 02:43:00.890
Keg's armor. Your hand goes back like that--

02:43:00.890 --> 02:43:02.392
ASHLY: Ah, sorry! Sorry!

02:43:02.392 --> 02:43:05.007
MARISHA: Ah! Why'd you put spikes on it?!

02:43:05.007 --> 02:43:06.112
ASHLY: I look cool!

02:43:06.112 --> 02:43:12.740
MARISHA: Fuck! Ow! Okay, next one. 17.

02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:14.612
MATT: That does hit, roll damage.

02:43:17.492 --> 02:43:19.573
MARISHA: Okay, nine.

02:43:19.573 --> 02:43:20.827
MATT: Nine points of damage against him.

02:43:20.827 --> 02:43:22.748
MARISHA, MATT, and AUDIENCE: Nein!

02:43:22.748 --> 02:43:27.308
MATT: Down on the back of the head, and you can
see blood spatter out of the nose and mouth across

02:43:27.696 --> 02:43:30.104
the stone. Looks back at you, like (grunting);
still standing.

02:43:30.104 --> 02:43:31.596
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

02:43:34.446 --> 02:43:36.424
SAM: (kung fu movie accent) Flurry!

02:43:36.424 --> 02:43:37.952
MATT: All right. How many ki points do you have
left now?

02:43:37.952 --> 02:43:38.899
MARISHA: Three.

02:43:38.899 --> 02:43:39.849
MATT: All righty.

02:43:39.849 --> 02:43:50.114
MARISHA: Okay. First attack-- that's cocked. I'm
sorry, it was a good one too. Oh, it's the same

02:43:50.385 --> 02:43:56.303
roll though: 19! These are two off-handed, right?

02:43:56.303 --> 02:43:57.757
MATT: Yeah, so it's the d6.

02:43:57.757 --> 02:44:08.062
MARISHA: Okay, eight damage on the first one. And
second one, same exact roll. 19 again.

02:44:08.062 --> 02:44:09.764
MATT: All right; damage on the next one.

02:44:09.764 --> 02:44:15.349
MARISHA: And same roll again, nine. Two nines, 18
total damage.

02:44:15.349 --> 02:44:17.512
SAM and MARISHA: (pow pow pow)

02:44:17.512 --> 02:44:24.459
MATT: The first hit clocks the side of Protto's
face: this weird, scraggly halfling goatee matted

02:44:24.459 --> 02:44:31.552
with his own blood. His blade still out, he looks
up at you, grits his teeth and is the middle of

02:44:31.552 --> 02:44:36.599
saying, "I'm going to gut you--" (fist impact),
and is out cold on the ground.

02:44:36.599 --> 02:44:38.625
MARISHA: Just throw in a few more!

02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:41.620
(cheering)

02:44:41.635 --> 02:44:43.153
SAM: All right, one down.

02:44:46.833 --> 02:44:48.865
MATT: That your turn?

02:44:48.876 --> 02:44:50.183
MARISHA: That's my turn.

02:44:50.183 --> 02:44:53.422
MATT: Okay. And with that, that brings us to Caleb
and Keg.

02:44:54.062 --> 02:45:03.658
LIAM: Okay, this is still going very good, so I am
going to slide along the wall that I'm on to try

02:45:03.658 --> 02:45:11.557
to get to the space where Beau had been before she
started. Now that the little weasel is dead, ja,

02:45:11.557 --> 02:45:13.011
I'll stay against the wall if I can.

02:45:13.011 --> 02:45:13.696
MATT: There?

02:45:13.696 --> 02:45:18.570
LIAM: Ja. And then I'm going to lose
Invisibility because I start to weave my hand

02:45:18.570 --> 02:45:25.844
around my arm and I am going to release Scorching
Ray, three globs of fire up his ass in the sky.

02:45:25.844 --> 02:45:27.139
MATT: All right.

02:45:27.139 --> 02:45:31.365
[cheering]

02:45:31.365 --> 02:45:36.846
MATT: From out of the ether, a
for-quite-a-while-invisible Caleb suddenly blinks

02:45:36.846 --> 02:45:42.337
into view as these glowing embers begin to swirl
around his hands, turning into a gouting burst of

02:45:42.337 --> 02:45:44.085
flame. Go ahead and roll for your strikes.

02:45:44.085 --> 02:45:46.488
LIAM: Well, the first one was a natural zwanzig,
so--

02:45:46.488 --> 02:45:53.282
[cheering]

02:45:53.282 --> 02:45:59.448
LIAM: The second is a 19, and the third is a 23.

02:45:59.448 --> 02:45:59.933
SAM: Ooh!

02:45:59.933 --> 02:46:05.876
[cheering]

02:46:05.876 --> 02:46:11.066
LIAM: So 8d6 total. Ja.

02:46:11.066 --> 02:46:12.455
MARISHA: Damage?!

02:46:12.455 --> 02:46:17.706
LIAM: Well, the critical gets-- okay, so this
becomes an eight. Okay, Hold on. Ja. Okay, so

02:46:17.706 --> 02:46:27.324
that's ten...Okay. Und that is eleven, okay. And
then also this becomes 17... It's a total of 19

02:46:27.324 --> 02:46:29.555
damage of Scorching Ray to his ass.

02:46:29.555 --> 02:46:30.849
MATT: 19?

02:46:30.849 --> 02:46:31.346
LIAM: Yeah.

02:46:34.836 --> 02:46:40.945
MATT: All of them burst across the muscular, but
somewhat still rotund, like a barrel of muscle and

02:46:40.945 --> 02:46:46.612
blue rhinoceros hide. You see the flames leave
these darkened, blackened spots on his exposed

02:46:46.612 --> 02:46:50.871
belly from the center of this leather armor
strapped like a harness around his torso. He just

02:46:50.871 --> 02:46:54.328
looks at you, "Glad you could join us."

02:46:54.328 --> 02:46:59.367
LIAM: Eh, Wie gehts? That's the end.

02:46:59.367 --> 02:47:00.828
MATT: Keg, you're up.

02:47:00.828 --> 02:47:02.954
ASHLY: Okay, so he's how high right now?

02:47:02.954 --> 02:47:07.573
MATT: He's currently ten feet above you against
the ceiling.

02:47:07.929 --> 02:47:10.787
ASHLY: There's no way I can just-- is there?

02:47:10.787 --> 02:47:15.482
MATT: You could try off of the table for a strike,
if you'd like.

02:47:18.762 --> 02:47:21.100
ASHLY: Yeah, fuck it; okay. I'll try it.

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:23.062
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an athletics
check.

02:47:23.062 --> 02:47:30.313
ASHLY: Okay. Oh! (squeaks) Nine?

02:47:30.313 --> 02:47:32.756
MARISHA and AUDIENCE: Nein!

02:47:32.756 --> 02:47:37.782
MATT: You go and put your foot up onto the edge of
the splintered wood that is still damaged from the

02:47:37.782 --> 02:47:42.424
impacts you had earlier, and as you go to leap,
the wood gives out from under you and the table

02:47:42.424 --> 02:47:46.645
collapses, so you're unable to quite get in range
with him at the moment.

02:47:46.929 --> 02:47:51.263
ASHLY: Okay. Then I'm going to go try to fuck with
The RZA.

02:47:51.263 --> 02:47:52.417
MATT: All right.

02:47:52.417 --> 02:47:55.315
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Get a room!

02:47:57.485 --> 02:47:58.546
TALIESIN: Solid.

02:47:58.546 --> 02:48:01.723
MATT: There you go. There's Ruzza right there, you
manage to get into contact.

02:48:02.215 --> 02:48:09.029
ASHLY: Okay, I'm going to smack. That's a 19 plus
seven. I think that maybe hits.

02:48:09.029 --> 02:48:09.684
MATT: That'll hit.

02:48:09.684 --> 02:48:16.282
ASHLY: Okay, very good, and here we go. That'll be
ten points of damage.

02:48:16.282 --> 02:48:17.654
MATT: Nice.

02:48:17.654 --> 02:48:19.373
SAM: Take that, Wu Tang Clan.

02:48:19.373 --> 02:48:22.626
ASHLY: Did that athletics jump count as an action,
I'm assuming?

02:48:22.626 --> 02:48:23.282
MATT: Hmm?

02:48:23.282 --> 02:48:25.111
ASHLY: Was the athletics check an action?

02:48:25.111 --> 02:48:26.374
MATT: That was more part of your movement, so--

02:48:26.374 --> 02:48:27.854
ASHLY: So I can hit her two more times?

02:48:27.854 --> 02:48:29.261
MATT: Two more times, yeah.

02:48:29.261 --> 02:48:31.336
ASHLY: Okay! 19.

02:48:31.336 --> 02:48:33.629
MATT: 19 hits.

02:48:33.629 --> 02:48:37.729
ASHLY: And that is 12.

02:48:37.729 --> 02:48:39.085
MATT: 12 does not hit.

02:48:39.085 --> 02:48:40.498
ASHLY: No, that's damage!

02:48:40.498 --> 02:48:42.745
MATT: Oh, 12 points of damage! There you go. Oof,
all right.

02:48:42.745 --> 02:48:49.588
ASHLY: And then one more time, just for fun, and
that will be a 16 plus seven, which I believe also hits.

02:48:49.874 --> 02:48:51.219
MATT: That hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage
again.

02:48:51.219 --> 02:48:56.117
ASHLY: Come on! Big money, no whammies! Well, that
was kind of a whammy: five.

02:48:56.117 --> 02:49:02.465
MATT: All right, got it. Ruzza's taken a few hits
and you're now starting to see blood streaks

02:49:02.465 --> 02:49:08.272
across the face from where the heavy flat side of
your warhammer has smashed into her jaw. Some of

02:49:08.272 --> 02:49:12.863
the teeth seem to be cracked, and you see her spit
one out onto the stone. "All right, I see your

02:49:12.863 --> 02:49:14.150
"game again, Keg."

02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:15.396
ASHLY: Hey, babe.

02:49:15.396 --> 02:49:18.167
MATT: That ends your turn?

02:49:18.167 --> 02:49:18.715
ASHLY: Yes.

02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:20.317
MATT: All right, it is now Lorenzo's turn.

02:49:20.317 --> 02:49:26.277
SAM: Oh, shit. Caleb? Stay safe, Caleb!

02:49:27.747 --> 02:49:28.823
LIAM: Help.

02:49:28.828 --> 02:49:36.838
[background music]

02:49:36.853 --> 02:49:39.718
SAM: Oh, he's trying. He's working the angles
right now.

02:49:39.718 --> 02:49:42.338
ASHLY: He's really thinking. Oh man. The
equations.

02:49:42.338 --> 02:49:45.623
SAM: He's thinking about all of the great stuff
available at D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

02:49:49.353 --> 02:49:55.109
MATT: All right. And with that, after the
scorching strikes that were against him, Lorenzo's

02:49:55.109 --> 02:50:00.829
going to coast through the air, arms out at the
side wielding the giant, jagged glaive, grinning,

02:50:00.829 --> 02:50:13.313
smiling towards Caleb. (malicious laugh) And is
going to arc down just enough to catch you on the

02:50:13.313 --> 02:50:20.827
outside of the glaive's range. Two strikes against
you. The first one is going to be a 14 to hit?

02:50:20.827 --> 02:50:21.492
LIAM: Hits.

02:50:21.492 --> 02:50:25.543
SAM: Oh, he's so weak!

02:50:28.323 --> 02:50:30.093
LIAM: Dead, the word is dead.

02:50:32.013 --> 02:50:40.105
MATT: That is going to be 14 points of slashing
damage. The next is going to be a 15 to hit.

02:50:42.305 --> 02:50:44.078
SAM: Shield! Shield! Shield!

02:50:44.078 --> 02:50:46.073
MATT: That is 15 points of slashing damage.

02:50:46.073 --> 02:50:47.408
LIAM: Okay.

02:50:51.058 --> 02:50:53.266
MARISHA: Are you still conscious?

02:50:53.266 --> 02:50:55.043
SAM: (cooing) Shield! (coo)

02:50:59.803 --> 02:51:01.050
LIAM: Who hurt you?

02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:05.302
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Lorenzo!

02:51:05.302 --> 02:51:09.806
MATT: And with that, he's going to go ahead and
shift further--

02:51:09.806 --> 02:51:10.806
SAM: Oh no.

02:51:16.740 --> 02:51:20.697
MATT: Back, just keeping an eye. Keeping his
options open, making sure he's not too far from

02:51:20.697 --> 02:51:25.806
anybody. That's going to go ahead and end
Lorenzo's turn, it's now Ruzza's turn. Ruzza is

02:51:25.806 --> 02:51:30.421
going to expend a level three Hold Person--

02:51:30.421 --> 02:51:31.089
ASHLY: Ooh.

02:51:35.979 --> 02:51:37.080
MATT: Against Keg.

02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:39.384
ASHLY: Surprise, surprise.

02:51:39.384 --> 02:51:44.538
MATT: And against Beau, who are the two that are
currently most visible and bludgeoning her allies.

02:51:44.538 --> 02:51:46.728
I need you both to make wisdom saving throws.

02:51:46.728 --> 02:51:49.230
KHARY: Come on, come on.

02:51:49.230 --> 02:51:50.855
ASHLY: 18.

02:51:50.855 --> 02:51:56.949
[cheering]

02:51:56.949 --> 02:51:58.147
MARISHA: Ten.

02:51:58.147 --> 02:52:01.400
[groaning]

02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:03.283
SAM: Matt, where is The RZA on the--

02:52:03.283 --> 02:52:04.852
ASHLY: Next to Nefertiti.

02:52:04.852 --> 02:52:11.718
MATT: This is a unique setup for the live show, so
thank you for being patient.

02:52:11.718 --> 02:52:13.193
ASHLY: It's the matchup you've all been waiting
for.

02:52:13.193 --> 02:52:18.068
MATT: Exactly. You manage to shrug off the effect.
You feel it encasing your brain, your body begins

02:52:18.068 --> 02:52:23.529
to tighten for a second before you manage to have
it have no effect. However, behind you over there,

02:52:23.529 --> 02:52:25.518
Beau's body seizes and freezes up.

02:52:25.518 --> 02:52:28.147
MARISHA: (groaning)

02:52:28.147 --> 02:52:29.141
SAM: Oh no.

02:52:32.031 --> 02:52:33.774
MARISHA: It's oddly painful.

02:52:33.774 --> 02:52:43.570
MATT: Ruzza's going to, as a bonus action, look up
and say "All right, Lorenzo! I think it's time you

02:52:43.882 --> 02:52:49.575
"really, er, really show them what you've got,
buddy!" She's going to give a d8 inspiration die

02:52:49.575 --> 02:52:50.260
to Lorenzo.

02:52:50.260 --> 02:52:51.420
ASHLY: Shit.

02:52:51.420 --> 02:52:55.561
MATT: Ending Ruzza's turn; Caduceus, you're up.

02:52:55.561 --> 02:53:12.881
TALIESIN: Okay. Yeah, okay. This'll be fun. I'm
going to-- Let's try something weird, I like weird.

02:53:13.658 --> 02:53:18.152
MATT: I like weird.

02:53:18.152 --> 02:53:21.718
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a couple steps towards
the wall and I'm going to get a little closer to

02:53:21.718 --> 02:53:29.561
that terrible little bard there. I'm going to put
my back against the upward wall, so that I'm out

02:53:29.561 --> 02:53:34.841
of range of the big blue. Am I, like, 15 feet from
the bard?

02:53:34.841 --> 02:53:35.672
MATT: You are.

02:53:35.672 --> 02:53:44.705
TALIESIN: Perfect. I'm going to cast Spirit
Guardians. I'm going to start whispering into my

02:53:44.705 --> 02:53:50.741
big purple crystal and then tons of tiny little
adorable, sharp-toothed fairies are going to come

02:53:50.741 --> 02:53:56.172
out and start biting and eating a lot. They're
adorable.

02:53:56.172 --> 02:53:58.161
MATT: All right, I believe that's a wisdom saving
throw for Ruzza?

02:53:58.161 --> 02:54:01.161
TALIESIN: That's a wisdom saving throw for half
damage.

02:54:01.161 --> 02:54:07.105
MATT: It's a 14 plus two, so 16. What's your DC?

02:54:07.105 --> 02:54:07.937
TALIESIN: Ooh. 16.

02:54:07.937 --> 02:54:09.551
MATT: So that's half damage from the Spirit
Guardians.

02:54:09.551 --> 02:54:15.171
TALIESIN: All right, that's fine; it stays up
forever. Let's see, where's the damage? Oh, there

02:54:15.171 --> 02:54:18.198
it is! One, two. I don't have enough dice for
this, that's great.

02:54:18.198 --> 02:54:19.016
SAM: Here.

02:54:19.016 --> 02:54:30.777
TALIESIN: Let me have a d8. So that's (counting)
nine points halved of radiant damage.

02:54:30.777 --> 02:54:32.008
MATT: How much total?

02:54:32.008 --> 02:54:34.256
TALIESIN: Half of nine points of radiant damage.

02:54:34.256 --> 02:54:37.395
MATT: So four. Four points to Ruzza.

02:54:37.395 --> 02:54:40.940
TALIESIN: As long as he's in the range of it, he's
at half speed.

02:54:40.940 --> 02:54:44.638
MATT: She's at half speed. Got it. Cool. Spirit
Guardians is up. That's your action?

02:54:44.638 --> 02:54:50.331
TALIESIN: That is my action. As a bonus action,
sorry, I'm learning this.

02:54:50.331 --> 02:54:53.555
MATT: I don't think you have much in the way of
bonus actions.

02:54:53.555 --> 02:55:01.926
TALIESIN: I thought I had a thing I could do!
Sorry, one second. I don't have much. As a bonus

02:55:01.926 --> 02:55:06.964
action, I'm going to-- can I see Caleb?

02:55:06.964 --> 02:55:08.428
MATT: You can, yes.

02:55:08.428 --> 02:55:13.984
TALIESIN: As a bonus action can I cast Healing
Word as a level two spell?

02:55:13.984 --> 02:55:17.575
MATT: You cannot, because you've already cast a
level one spell. Only a cantrip.

02:55:17.575 --> 02:55:19.784
TALIESIN: Only a cantrip now, okay. Nevermind,
then.

02:55:19.784 --> 02:55:23.008
MATT: That ends your turn? Shakäste. You're up.

02:55:23.008 --> 02:55:24.555
SAM: Shakäste!

02:55:24.555 --> 02:55:29.821
KHARY: I would like to--

02:55:29.821 --> 02:55:31.439
SAM: Rage.

02:55:31.439 --> 02:55:37.605
[laughter]

02:55:37.605 --> 02:55:44.111
KHARY: I would like to Command Lorenzo to freeze.

02:55:44.111 --> 02:55:49.747
MATT: So what is the Command word on that one?

02:55:49.747 --> 02:55:54.610
KHARY: So I can tell him, you know, as far as--
that means you can't do nothing. You just got to

02:55:54.610 --> 02:55:56.567
stand there, you've got to do nothing.

02:55:56.567 --> 02:56:02.159
MATT: Well you've got Halt, which means they don't
move and take no actions. Okay, is that what

02:56:02.159 --> 02:56:03.061
you're doing?

02:56:03.061 --> 02:56:12.268
KHARY: Freeze, baby. Just like in the 1970s
television with Starsky &amp;amp; Hutch. When they say

02:56:12.268 --> 02:56:15.806
freeze, you don't do shit. You just sit there, and
do nothing.

02:56:15.806 --> 02:56:19.547
MATT: It's a natural 15 plus one; it's a 16.
What's your DC?

02:56:19.547 --> 02:56:20.340
LIAM: 15.

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:28.254
MATT: Resists the command. I'm sorry! You still
have your Nefertiti.

02:56:28.254 --> 02:56:36.907
KHARY: All right. Let's see, we're so close to--
let's see if we can knock out The RZA.

02:56:36.907 --> 02:56:38.289
MATT: Go for it. Make the attack roll.

02:56:38.289 --> 02:56:39.535
MARISHA: She sucks.

02:56:39.535 --> 02:56:47.405
KHARY: Fuck me and my Mom! Why?!

02:56:50.595 --> 02:56:52.880
SAM: You've got to do it in Egyptian!

02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:56.909
KHARY: It's a what? I rolled a three.

02:56:56.909 --> 02:56:57.800
LIAM: Three plus--

02:56:57.800 --> 02:56:59.211
MATT: Yeah, that's not going to hit.

02:57:00.841 --> 02:57:02.756
KHARY: It's a ten! It's a ten.

02:57:02.756 --> 02:57:09.162
MATT: Nefertiti's still trying to apparate! She
hasn't quite taken her full form yet. The

02:57:09.429 --> 02:57:12.743
spiritual energy hasn't coalesced enough to have
an impact, but she's on her way.

02:57:12.743 --> 02:57:17.588
MARISHA: She's going to be the MVP, man. I can
feel it. When it works, it's going to be glorious.

02:57:18.014 --> 02:57:18.850
MATT: Would you like to move?

02:57:18.850 --> 02:57:20.091
KHARY: It's going to be amazing. Would I like to
move?

02:57:20.091 --> 02:57:21.611
LIAM: Egypt is just so far away!

02:57:21.611 --> 02:57:30.708
KHARY: Yeah. Just back away. Back into that corner
there. Yeah, back to The Duchess. Son of a bitch.

02:57:30.708 --> 02:57:36.143
MATT: All right, so that ends Shakäste's turn. Top
of the round: Nott.

02:57:36.143 --> 02:57:39.406
SAM: Is anyone engaged with The RZA?

02:57:39.406 --> 02:57:40.595
ASHLY: I am.

02:57:40.595 --> 02:57:41.887
MATT: Currently Keg is, yes.

02:57:41.887 --> 02:57:52.645
SAM: I will attack The RZA. Not good, 16. Oh, no--
yeah, 16.

02:57:52.645 --> 02:57:54.044
MATT: 16 hits, yeah.

02:57:54.044 --> 02:57:58.350
[cheering]

02:57:58.350 --> 02:57:59.422
KHARY: Come on!

02:57:59.422 --> 02:58:02.483
SAM: That's 17 points of damage.

02:58:02.483 --> 02:58:10.820
MATT: She has to make a constitution saving throw
to see if she can maintain. That was almost a 16,

02:58:10.820 --> 02:58:13.814
but turned into a three. So the Hold Person wore
off.

02:58:13.814 --> 02:58:16.634
[cheering]

02:58:16.634 --> 02:58:18.657
MARISHA: Thank you, girl! Thank you!

02:58:18.657 --> 02:58:21.257
SAM: Us ladies have to stick together.

02:58:21.257 --> 02:58:23.772
MARISHA: Girl power!

02:58:23.772 --> 02:58:27.002
SAM: Is she still alive, The RZA?

02:58:27.002 --> 02:58:30.195
MATT: Yes, though hurt very badly.

02:58:30.195 --> 02:58:36.250
SAM: I'll shoot one more time, why not? That is 17
to hit.

02:58:36.250 --> 02:58:37.460
MATT: That does hit, yes.

02:58:37.460 --> 02:58:41.331
SAM: Just seven that time.

02:58:41.331 --> 02:58:42.737
MATT: Seven points of damage?

02:58:42.737 --> 02:58:43.413
SAM: Yep.

02:58:43.413 --> 02:58:55.100
MATT: All righty. Ruzza takes the next bolt-- the
first one strikes right in the sternum area and

02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:59.016
sinks in rather deep. Instinctively, she reaches
up and grabs it, (grunt of pain), looks over in

02:58:59.016 --> 02:59:03.304
the direction where it came from, and at that
moment, the second crossbow bolt goes right into

02:59:03.304 --> 02:59:10.540
the throat. She opens her mouth, trying to make a
sound, and instead nothing but blood pours out of

02:59:10.540 --> 02:59:11.379
the corner.

02:59:11.379 --> 02:59:12.863
SAM: I'll just say--

02:59:12.863 --> 02:59:16.263
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:59:16.263 --> 02:59:19.836
ASHLY: Hell yeah!

02:59:19.836 --> 02:59:22.384
[cheering]

02:59:22.384 --> 02:59:23.712
SAM: Bards suck!

02:59:23.712 --> 02:59:30.571
(laughter)

02:59:30.571 --> 02:59:32.022
SAM: I'll just back up even further.

02:59:32.022 --> 02:59:34.176
MATT: You'll back up a little bit, you said?

02:59:34.176 --> 02:59:37.923
SAM: Back up even further, away from any danger.

02:59:37.923 --> 02:59:39.835
MATT: Over by Shakäste?

02:59:39.835 --> 02:59:41.314
SAM: Yeah.

02:59:41.314 --> 02:59:44.341
MATT: Or all the way to the furnace?

02:59:44.341 --> 02:59:52.583
SAM: Oh, in the testes area up there. The little
closet thing that's-- yeah, that's good.

02:59:52.583 --> 03:00:00.134
MATT: There you go. That ends your turn; that
brings us to Beau.

03:00:00.134 --> 03:00:10.953
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to turn around, and can I
quickly flip the table that Protto had flipped

03:00:10.953 --> 03:00:13.396
over-- flip it back onto its legs?

03:00:13.396 --> 03:00:14.844
MATT: Yeah, sure. You manage to--

03:00:14.844 --> 03:00:18.554
MARISHA: (impact) Then I'm going to--

03:00:18.554 --> 03:00:24.776
MATT: That is your action. Because you have to
grab it, and it's a whole motion to get it up there.

03:00:25.124 --> 03:00:37.262
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. I'm going to jump on it.
(singing) Jump on it! Then I'm going to take my

03:00:37.262 --> 03:00:46.358
bonus action to do Patient Defense. I'm going to
look at Lorenzo and be like: Your new look sucks,

03:00:46.358 --> 03:00:50.242
man! Then do Patient Defense.

03:00:50.242 --> 03:00:54.267
MATT: Patient Defense, good. All righty. Caleb and
Keg.

03:00:54.267 --> 03:01:04.474
LIAM: So I am bleeding profusely everywhere, and I
am going to stumble in the direction-- I think

03:01:04.853 --> 03:01:14.273
that's Keg, she's short. I will go that way as far
as I can, and as I go I say: This is going very well.

03:01:14.273 --> 03:01:18.591
MATT: You have ten more feet, you can go in either
direction.

03:01:18.591 --> 03:01:27.054
LIAM: If I go to the right, will I clear out of
that flying guy's line of sight?

03:01:27.054 --> 03:01:32.775
MATT: You have two more spaces. You can go near
Caduceus--

03:01:32.775 --> 03:01:37.717
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to cut directly right
towards Caduceus and just before I disappear out

03:01:37.717 --> 03:01:43.954
of view, I'm going to say: Hey, how's your day?
And I will send a Fire Bolt at Lorenzo.

03:01:43.954 --> 03:01:45.375
MATT: Roll for the attack.

03:01:45.375 --> 03:01:52.251
LIAM: Ja. Eh, it's not that great. It's a 16.

03:01:52.251 --> 03:01:56.084
MATT: All righty. That does hit, exactly.

03:01:56.084 --> 03:02:01.204
(cheering)

03:02:01.204 --> 03:02:03.110
TALIESIN: Well, this has been exciting.

03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:09.512
LIAM: Okay. That's good. That's also good. So 14
points of fire damage.

03:02:09.512 --> 03:02:17.675
MATT: Flames burst across, you see the leather
cracks in one part of the harness. He just grins

03:02:17.884 --> 03:02:18.621
back at you.

03:02:18.621 --> 03:02:23.167
LIAM: Ja, and then hopefully I'm disappearing
around the corner and leaning my face against the

03:02:23.167 --> 03:02:24.256
wall, like that.

03:02:26.626 --> 03:02:28.674
MATT: That ends your turn. Keg?

03:02:28.674 --> 03:02:31.612
ASHLY: I'm rushing and I'm jumping on top of the
table.

03:02:31.612 --> 03:02:34.430
SAM: This table, man.

03:02:35.154 --> 03:02:38.444
ASHLY: It's the centerpiece of our attack plan. Is
that enough--

03:02:38.444 --> 03:02:46.828
MARISHA: Oh my god, Keg. This is just like
Titanic. Just me and you, floating on this--

03:02:46.828 --> 03:02:54.242
ASHLY: Keg is... in love? It's gone past just
arousal. Can I reach Lorenzo from the table?

03:02:54.242 --> 03:02:59.010
MATT: Possibly, yeah. You give a little jump as
you swing; he's just in reach with the table's help.

03:02:59.010 --> 03:03:03.002
ASHLY: Okay, here we go. 18.

03:03:03.002 --> 03:03:04.078
MATT: 18 hits.

03:03:07.218 --> 03:03:08.429
ASHLY: That's six.

03:03:08.429 --> 03:03:10.770
MATT: Six points of damage, nice.

03:03:10.770 --> 03:03:16.672
ASHLY: Here we go again, on my own. That will not
hit. And one more time, for the cheap seats; that

03:03:16.672 --> 03:03:18.210
will not hit. Okay, go ahead.

03:03:18.210 --> 03:03:23.418
MATT: Aw. But you still get one swing that cuts
through and carves through part of the outer leg

03:03:23.789 --> 03:03:28.610
and calf of Lorenzo. The leg gets pushed back a
bit from the impact as he's floating. His large,

03:03:28.610 --> 03:03:35.732
almost-corpulent form, though of solid muscle,
just sitting there, enduring it. His face focus

03:03:35.732 --> 03:03:42.222
comes from where Caleb was back towards you and
says, "Well, glad you could join the party, Keg."

03:03:42.222 --> 03:03:43.480
That ends your turn?

03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:44.151
ASHLY: Yes.

03:03:44.151 --> 03:03:46.323
MATT: That makes it Lorenzo's turn.

03:03:46.358 --> 03:03:49.428
AUDIENCE: No!

03:03:49.433 --> 03:03:54.001
SAM: He's going to decide to turn over a new leaf,
and--

03:03:54.001 --> 03:03:56.500
TALIESIN: Manage a Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond. It's going
to be nice.

03:03:56.500 --> 03:03:57.147
SAM: Yeah, sure.

03:03:57.147 --> 03:03:58.426
MARISHA: He gets into real estate.

03:03:58.426 --> 03:04:00.843
SAM: Yeah, gets his license on the second try.

03:04:00.843 --> 03:04:06.333
(laughter)

03:04:06.333 --> 03:04:11.592
ASHLY: There's so much thinking when Lorenzo's
turn comes up and it's very scary.

03:04:11.592 --> 03:04:13.127
MARISHA: Do I get a thing?

03:04:13.127 --> 03:04:17.119
MATT: No. You've got to jump to hit him, but he's
not within your melee range when you're standing.

03:04:20.199 --> 03:04:26.027
[groaning]

03:04:26.027 --> 03:04:27.801
TALIESIN: Why are we standing next to each other?

03:04:27.801 --> 03:04:28.692
SAM: You guys tried--

03:04:28.692 --> 03:04:33.243
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, once he's within 15 feet of
me, he gets half speed. Oh, no, he's not walking.

03:04:33.730 --> 03:04:37.580
MATT: Spirit Guardian still slows his movement, I
believe. Does it say walking speed, or just walking.

03:04:37.580 --> 03:04:39.250
TALIESIN: Once he enters the field he also, I
believe--

03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:45.007
MATT: Has to make a wisdom save, which is a 12
plus four, 16.

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:46.141
TALIESIN: 16 is the--

03:04:46.141 --> 03:04:50.085
MATT: So take half damage, roll for damage. He
still takes damage. You also watch, as Lorenzo

03:04:50.085 --> 03:04:54.066
coasts through the air, some of the wounds that he
suffered seem to be slowly sealing up.

03:04:54.066 --> 03:04:56.563
ASHLY: Oh, come on!

03:04:56.563 --> 03:05:09.630
SAM: God, this guy. Matt, there's an audience here
that deserves a certain amount of death and payoff.

03:05:09.883 --> 03:05:12.767
TALIESIN: 18, so half of 18. It's radiant damage.
Is radiant damage doing anything to him?

03:05:12.767 --> 03:05:15.637
MATT: Nothing more than just terrible radiant
damage.

03:05:15.637 --> 03:05:16.241
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:05:16.241 --> 03:05:25.693
MATT: It blasts him, and as he pulls into the
area, he goes, "Ooh. That's not going to do," and vanishes.

03:05:25.693 --> 03:05:31.709
MARISHA: No! Why?!

03:05:34.129 --> 03:05:36.223
MATT: Caduceus, it's your turn.

03:05:39.163 --> 03:05:40.942
TALIESIN: Hmm.

03:05:44.182 --> 03:05:46.755
LIAM: I'm having Raishan flashbacks.

03:05:46.755 --> 03:05:51.853
TALIESIN: I'm having a little regret that I didn't
pack that Faerie Fire, man.

03:05:51.853 --> 03:05:54.123
AUDIENCE: Aw.

03:05:54.123 --> 03:05:57.416
TALIESIN: Who knew? I was drinking tea last time I
got to pick spells.

03:05:57.416 --> 03:06:00.056
MARISHA: Faerie Fire is one of the best fucking
spells, man!

03:06:00.056 --> 03:06:04.786
TALIESIN: I'm curious about these rooms back here,
those grates that you've still got covered over.

03:06:04.786 --> 03:06:05.886
What's over there?

03:06:05.886 --> 03:06:07.259
MATT: I don't know, do you want to go see?

03:06:07.259 --> 03:06:08.406
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to run over there--

03:06:08.406 --> 03:06:09.990
SAM: Wait, you're looting?!

03:06:09.990 --> 03:06:11.441
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over there.

03:06:11.441 --> 03:06:18.040
MATT: That's your movement can get you that close.
You can use your action to make a perception check

03:06:18.327 --> 03:06:19.617
if you want to glare through.

03:06:19.617 --> 03:06:23.671
TALIESIN: It'll get me that close? I would like to
be a little further away so that I am not in blast

03:06:23.671 --> 03:06:25.483
radius with two other people.

03:06:25.483 --> 03:06:26.119
MATT: There?

03:06:26.119 --> 03:06:35.699
TALIESIN: Yeah. Looks to be a little better. Darn
it, yeah. I'm going to use my action to--

03:06:35.699 --> 03:06:39.666
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage
because there is no light source inside that

03:06:39.666 --> 03:06:42.680
chamber, and you do not have darkvision, which I
remembered.

03:06:42.680 --> 03:06:48.301
SAM: (stage whisper) Liam, don't you have a potion
or something?

03:06:48.301 --> 03:06:49.728
LIAM: Ja.

03:06:49.728 --> 03:06:52.446
MATT: Make your roll.

03:06:52.446 --> 03:06:56.283
SAM: I mean-- (cooing)

03:06:59.673 --> 03:07:01.214
TALIESIN: 15.

03:07:01.214 --> 03:07:08.085
MATT: 15. Looking through, it's hard to see, but
you can make out a few shapes; they look to be

03:07:08.345 --> 03:07:13.210
humanoid figures that are still gagged and chained
on the far-back side of the interior there.

03:07:13.210 --> 03:07:19.489
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to turn back around.
That was my action to take a look in there?

03:07:19.489 --> 03:07:24.629
MATT: Yeah. You're peering in very closely to try
and make out the details of an area with no light

03:07:24.629 --> 03:07:25.919
source in the middle of combat.

03:07:25.919 --> 03:07:32.772
TALIESIN: Aw, man. Okay, that's my turn.

03:07:32.772 --> 03:07:33.376
MATT: Okay.

03:07:33.376 --> 03:07:36.592
SAM: Weirdly, the map looks even more like my
penis now.

03:07:36.592 --> 03:07:45.228
MATT: You should really get that checked out, Sam.
All right, finishing Caduceus's turn. Shakäste,

03:07:45.228 --> 03:07:46.107
you're up.

03:07:46.107 --> 03:07:56.938
KHARY: All right, I guess Shakäste and the Duchess
will move into the chamber and check the other

03:07:57.190 --> 03:07:58.554
side of this chamber now that it's--

03:07:58.554 --> 03:08:00.137
MATT: Whereabouts do you want to go?

03:08:00.137 --> 03:08:07.066
KHARY: As far to the other side of this penis as
we can get, yeah.

03:08:07.066 --> 03:08:09.624
MATT: That's about as far as you can get with your
movement.

03:08:09.624 --> 03:08:17.650
KHARY: Have the Duchess follow me as well. Go
ahead and go to the end of the chamber there--

03:08:17.650 --> 03:08:19.038
MATT: Right over here?

03:08:19.038 --> 03:08:23.229
KHARY: Yeah, and perch there. Can she see inside?

03:08:23.229 --> 03:08:26.558
MATT: Make a perception check for the Duchess with
a disadvantage.

03:08:26.558 --> 03:08:30.583
KHARY: Yes it is, it's at disadvantage.

03:08:31.339 --> 03:08:36.350
MATT: Actually, no. We decided that the Duchess
design had darkvision, so just a straight roll.

03:08:36.350 --> 03:08:37.269
Whatever you rolled.

03:08:37.269 --> 03:08:39.646
LIAM: Seven plus...

03:08:39.646 --> 03:08:42.274
KHARY: 11.

03:08:42.274 --> 03:08:44.520
MATT: It's hard to make out anything in there.

03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:45.732
KHARY: Hard to see in there.

03:08:45.732 --> 03:08:49.346
MATT: There is a chamber in there, but there's not
enough light to make out the details of it,

03:08:49.346 --> 03:08:54.994
unfortunately. Does that finish your turn? You can
move your Nefertiti, if you'd like.

03:08:56.619 --> 03:08:59.279
[laughter]

03:08:59.279 --> 03:09:18.818
KHARY: You know, why don't you hang back? Is there
any light in that chamber that Thaumaturgy could

03:09:18.818 --> 03:09:20.278
maybe illuminate?

03:09:20.278 --> 03:09:23.974
MATT: There is a candelabra that has low light
over there that is giving a faint glow and there

03:09:23.974 --> 03:09:27.540
are two torches in the sides here that are also
giving off this low red-orange--

03:09:27.540 --> 03:09:29.949
KHARY: But nothing in the room?

03:09:29.949 --> 03:09:31.365
MATT: Nothing in the room, no.

03:09:31.365 --> 03:09:38.936
KHARY: We might as well Thaumaturgy to see if we
can make a little more light in the room.

03:09:38.936 --> 03:09:46.113
MATT: As you do so, the flames flare up, and the
long shadows stretch from beyond the bars into the

03:09:46.113 --> 03:09:53.631
chamber and you can see an unconscious figure on
the far back end that is also in full manacles:

03:09:53.631 --> 03:09:57.367
chained, and gagged-- facing away from you. You
can't see any more details than that.

03:09:57.367 --> 03:10:03.292
KHARY: That's really all I've got. I can't start
working on these locks at all, can I?

03:10:03.292 --> 03:10:06.082
MATT: Not with using Thaumaturgy as your action,
no.

03:10:06.082 --> 03:10:07.424
KHARY: All right, there you go.

03:10:07.424 --> 03:10:09.920
MATT: That finishes your turn. Back to the top--
Nott, what are you doing?

03:10:09.920 --> 03:10:17.763
SAM: Me? I'm going to peek around the corner; do I
see anything or anyone to attack?

03:10:18.277 --> 03:10:23.912
MATT: You don't see anybody in there. You could
make a perception check if you want to use that as

03:10:23.912 --> 03:10:25.474
your action. It's up to you.

03:10:25.474 --> 03:10:33.198
SAM: No, I will stay tucked in my little closet.
Is there a way I can hide but still see around the

03:10:33.198 --> 03:10:34.492
corner? No?

03:10:34.492 --> 03:10:39.646
MATT: Maybe? Roll a high stealth check, maybe.
We'll see.

03:10:39.646 --> 03:10:44.095
SAM: Nope. I mean 15, it's decent.

03:10:44.095 --> 03:10:45.367
MATT: Good to know.

03:10:45.367 --> 03:10:47.555
SAM: I'll just hold my action until I see
something.

03:10:47.555 --> 03:10:49.583
MATT: Okay, good to know. What are you holding?

03:10:49.583 --> 03:10:52.283
SAM: A crossbow bolt, ready to fire.

03:10:52.283 --> 03:10:54.705
MATT: You got it. Beau.

03:10:54.705 --> 03:10:59.268
MARISHA: I'm going to do the same thing: I am
going to crouch down and I'm going to pull two

03:10:59.268 --> 03:11:03.834
ninja stars, and I'm going to hold my action until
I see Lorenzo.

03:11:03.834 --> 03:11:06.570
MATT: You got it. Caleb, Keg.

03:11:06.570 --> 03:11:12.858
LIAM: (slurring) Caleb's face is pressed into the
wall and he says: I am so glad that we have two

03:11:12.858 --> 03:11:13.831
clerics, they will--

03:11:13.831 --> 03:11:20.785
[cheering]

03:11:20.785 --> 03:11:29.779
LIAM: They will get to you lickity-split. You're
going to be fine. But you know, maybe in the

03:11:29.779 --> 03:11:36.312
meantime I will pull that potion out of-- where is
it? That's not it. No, that's licorice; hold on,

03:11:36.312 --> 03:11:41.162
that's-- In our game, it's a bonus action to quaff
a potion? Am I remembering that right?

03:11:41.162 --> 03:11:42.765
MATT: Yeah, we're keeping that rule for our game.

03:11:42.765 --> 03:11:54.490
LIAM: So I'll shove that in my gullet. That's
totally the wrong die. Oh, that's okay. Seven

03:11:54.490 --> 03:11:56.120
points back. Okay, I'm cured!

03:11:56.120 --> 03:11:59.925
MATT: Absolved of all dam-- no.

03:11:59.925 --> 03:12:12.551
LIAM: I don't know where anything is or what's
going on and I feel real bad, so I'm going to try

03:12:12.551 --> 03:12:20.269
to crawl up the steps a bit, through the blood in
my face. Ja, I'll crawl up the steps and then,

03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:26.147
hey, I will just throw a Fire Bolt where he was.
That probably won't work, but let's do it.

03:12:26.147 --> 03:12:27.836
MATT: Roll for an attack with disadvantage.

03:12:27.836 --> 03:12:31.134
LIAM: Ja. Natural 20.

03:12:31.134 --> 03:12:34.301
[groaning]

03:12:34.301 --> 03:12:36.230
LIAM: That is a total of 12.

03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:39.713
MATT: It just burst into stone.

03:12:39.713 --> 03:12:41.510
LIAM: We did it, you guys.

03:12:44.090 --> 03:12:45.076
MATT: Keg.

03:12:45.076 --> 03:12:49.916
ASHLY: Would a perception check give me any
indication of what Lorenzo is doing?

03:12:49.916 --> 03:12:51.286
MATT: It's possible.

03:12:51.286 --> 03:12:52.916
ASHLY: All right, I'll give it a go.

03:12:52.916 --> 03:12:54.853
MATT: So you use your action to make a perception
check.

03:12:54.853 --> 03:12:57.963
ASHLY: That is 18?

03:13:03.333 --> 03:13:10.663
MATT: You just, looking over your shoulder, see
some sort of shift across the stone, like the

03:13:10.663 --> 03:13:16.128
pattern just moves and quakes ever so faintly
unnaturally against what would be the rather still

03:13:16.128 --> 03:13:18.028
though warm air.

03:13:18.028 --> 03:13:19.253
ASHLY: Right next to me?

03:13:19.253 --> 03:13:23.354
MATT: No, in the back of the chamber right here.
That's your action.

03:13:23.354 --> 03:13:24.402
ASHLY: Okay.

03:13:24.402 --> 03:13:26.004
SAM: Use your bow and arrow.

03:13:26.004 --> 03:13:28.232
ASHLY: I have a javelin.

03:13:28.232 --> 03:13:28.911
SAM: Ooh!

03:13:28.911 --> 03:13:30.919
ASHLY: I could try to javelin.

03:13:30.919 --> 03:13:31.508
SAM: Yeah!

03:13:31.508 --> 03:13:33.075
ASHLY: Shall I try to javelin?

03:13:33.075 --> 03:13:33.669
SAM: Yeah!

03:13:33.669 --> 03:13:36.972
ASHLY: Okay, here we go! 17?

03:13:36.972 --> 03:13:40.202
MATT: Well it was your action to try and perceive
where this--

03:13:40.202 --> 03:13:41.765
ASHLY: But can I bonus action?

03:13:41.765 --> 03:13:45.991
MATT: You can't take a bonus action attack unless
you've used your attack action before it, unfortunately.

03:13:46.411 --> 03:13:49.473
ASHLY: Tits McGee. Okay. Huh?

03:13:49.473 --> 03:13:52.804
SAM: Why don't you heal? (pigeon coos) Heal.

03:13:52.804 --> 03:13:56.245
ASHLY: Heal? I'm maxed.

03:13:56.245 --> 03:13:57.826
SAM: Okay.

03:13:57.826 --> 03:14:10.406
ASHLY: I will hop off the table and move toward
Nefertiti. Can I get closer?

03:14:10.406 --> 03:14:14.973
MATT: You can go there if you want. Or there.

03:14:14.973 --> 03:14:16.924
ASHLY: I'll go there, yeah, there.

03:14:16.924 --> 03:14:19.533
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn.

03:14:19.533 --> 03:14:20.916
SAM: (pigeon coos)

03:14:20.916 --> 03:14:24.149
ASHLY: I communicate that information to the group
as well.

03:14:24.149 --> 03:14:27.113
MATT: As Keg walks over saying, pointing
that direction telling the group.

03:14:27.113 --> 03:14:28.502
What do you tell them?

03:14:28.502 --> 03:14:31.704
ASHLY: I think there's something spooky happening
on the stone over here.

03:14:31.704 --> 03:14:33.091
SAM: Oh no, ghosts!

03:14:33.091 --> 03:14:38.046
MATT: As Keg walks forward pointing in that
direction, a familiar voice rings out right before

03:14:38.046 --> 03:14:46.923
you and says, "Oh little girl, you're making
crafting this nightmare too easy." With that,

03:14:46.923 --> 03:14:55.743
there's this curl of blueish arcane energy right
before you. Your hair begins to blow back from the

03:14:56.066 --> 03:15:01.566
force as a cold temperature begins to gather
directly ahead. With that, in a brief instant

03:15:01.566 --> 03:15:08.035
Lorenzo appears before you in his large demonic
form and unleashes--

03:15:08.035 --> 03:15:10.110
MARISHA: Do I have range?

03:15:10.110 --> 03:15:10.904
LIAM: Confetti!

03:15:10.904 --> 03:15:12.574
MARISHA: I think I see him!

03:15:12.574 --> 03:15:15.531
ASHLY: At least he's not floating.

03:15:15.531 --> 03:15:16.641
KHARY: Oh shit.

03:15:16.641 --> 03:15:23.891
[horrified gasping]

03:15:23.891 --> 03:15:26.300
SAM: Wait, I did not see Caleb in that cone.

03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:26.854
LIAM: No.

03:15:26.854 --> 03:15:27.874
MATT: A Cone of Cold.

03:15:27.874 --> 03:15:31.589
MARISHA: We get our held actions for when we see
him, though, first?

03:15:31.589 --> 03:15:33.150
MATT: You do, it happens simultaneously.

03:15:33.150 --> 03:15:34.663
MARISHA: (nervously) Okay.

03:15:34.663 --> 03:15:36.016
MATT: Go ahead and make your attacks.

03:15:40.576 --> 03:15:44.211
MARISHA: First one is an 18, second one's a 17.

03:15:44.211 --> 03:15:49.328
MATT: Well you only make one attack-- no two
attacks. I've allowed that house rule. Held

03:15:49.747 --> 03:15:52.429
attacks get the extra attack feature, so go for
it. So both hit.

03:15:52.429 --> 03:16:01.427
MARISHA: Both hit. First one. 13 damage.

03:16:01.427 --> 03:16:02.279
MATT: Nice.

03:16:03.989 --> 03:16:09.848
MARISHA: Second one-- wait! No, I'm wrong. These
are throwing stars.

03:16:09.999 --> 03:16:11.375
MATT: They're throwing stars, yeah. Sorry.

03:16:11.657 --> 03:16:18.929
MARISHA: Wrong die, I was doing my melee attack.
First one. Okay. Seven damage. Second one: five damage.

03:16:18.929 --> 03:16:22.208
MATT: A total of 12 damage from those two strikes.
Nott you also got one as well.

03:16:22.208 --> 03:16:24.593
SAM: Missed. Rolled a nine.

03:16:24.593 --> 03:16:25.473
MATT: With a what?

03:16:25.473 --> 03:16:26.259
SAM: Rolled a nine.

03:16:26.259 --> 03:16:27.578
MATT: Okay, yeah no.

03:16:27.578 --> 03:16:29.080
AUDIENCE: Nein!

03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:33.626
SAM: What? What is that number? Why are you saying
that?

03:16:36.606 --> 03:16:47.254
MATT: Okay, I need Caduceus, Beau, Shakäste, and
Keg to all roll constitution saving throws, please.

03:16:47.765 --> 03:16:49.234
SAM: You got this.

03:16:51.777 --> 03:16:53.407
KHARY: Roll this?

03:16:53.794 --> 03:16:54.865
LIAM: Yeah.

03:16:55.580 --> 03:16:59.607
[cheering]

03:16:59.607 --> 03:17:01.926
SAM: Come on, guys.

03:17:02.813 --> 03:17:03.894
ASHLY: 13.

03:17:03.894 --> 03:17:04.759
MATT: What was that?

03:17:04.759 --> 03:17:05.746
ASHLY: 13?

03:17:05.746 --> 03:17:07.340
MATT: 13? You just succeed.

03:17:07.340 --> 03:17:09.905
ASHLY, LIAM, AUDIENCE: Oh!

03:17:09.905 --> 03:17:11.231
TALIESIN: 14.

03:17:11.231 --> 03:17:12.716
MATT: 14. Nice.

03:17:14.606 --> 03:17:15.527
KHARY: Two.

03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:17.585
MARISHA: Six.

03:17:17.765 --> 03:17:19.545
AUDIENCE: Oh!

03:17:20.086 --> 03:17:23.899
MATT: Beau and Shakäste, you each suffer 44 points
of cold damage.

03:17:28.219 --> 03:17:30.471
ASHLY: No! No!

03:17:30.471 --> 03:17:32.669
LIAM: Were you at 33? You're unconscious.

03:17:32.669 --> 03:17:34.204
MARISHA: Beau is unconscious.

03:17:34.204 --> 03:17:35.025
LIAM: Both.

03:17:35.025 --> 03:17:36.412
KHARY: Shakäste's unconscious.

03:17:36.412 --> 03:17:37.298
SAM: Ugh!

03:17:40.498 --> 03:17:42.068
KHARY: I should have stayed.

03:17:42.234 --> 03:17:48.313
MATT: Nefertiti vanishes. That's 22 points of cold
damage to both Keg and Caduceus.

03:17:48.313 --> 03:17:51.219
SAM: Oh boy. Guys...

03:17:51.706 --> 03:17:53.034
TALIESIN: 22 points?

03:17:53.034 --> 03:17:58.767
MATT: You see the body of the thug you had killed
earlier, the body of Ruzza, and the body of

03:17:58.767 --> 03:18:08.310
Protto. Frozen statues, corpses on the ground
turned to sheer flash-frozen ice. There, on the

03:18:08.310 --> 03:18:16.215
ground covered and encased in pieces of frozen air
and moisture from the vicinity, the unconscious

03:18:16.215 --> 03:18:21.690
and dying bodies of Beauregard and Shakäste.

03:18:21.967 --> 03:18:23.736
AUDIENCE: No!

03:18:26.399 --> 03:18:27.528
TALIESIN: I'm good.

03:18:27.528 --> 03:18:34.342
MATT: Lorenzo, glancing back down at Keg, who
manages to shrug most of this off, says, "Don't

03:18:34.342 --> 03:18:43.010
worry. You're all next." And begins to back away.
You do get an attack of opportunity.

03:18:43.010 --> 03:18:46.329
ASHLY: Yes, I'm going to fucking take that attack
of opportunity.

03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:48.868
That's an 18!

03:18:48.868 --> 03:18:50.570
MATT: That hits.

03:18:52.340 --> 03:18:54.883
ASHLY: Seven damage.

03:18:55.406 --> 03:19:02.039
MATT: Seven damage. All righty. With that, it goes
to Caduceus' turn.

03:19:02.039 --> 03:19:13.831
TALIESIN: Okay, let's see what I can do with this.
First thing I'm going to do is use my bonus action--

03:19:14.262 --> 03:19:16.429
SAM: A little gardening.

03:19:16.429 --> 03:19:24.175
TALIESIN: To pot a very nice plant. Oh man, it's
so hard to do this. Okay, I'm going to use my

03:19:24.175 --> 03:19:32.340
bonus action to Spare the Dying to you, so we got
that.

03:19:33.648 --> 03:19:35.447
MATT: Spare the Dying is an action.

03:19:35.447 --> 03:19:38.937
TALIESIN: No, Spare the Dying for me is a bonus.

03:19:38.937 --> 03:19:41.001
MATT: Oh! Because-- that's right.

03:19:41.001 --> 03:19:42.971
[cheering]

03:19:44.291 --> 03:19:46.015
SAM: What does that do?

03:19:46.015 --> 03:19:52.228
TALIESIN: No more death saves. I'm going to run
over to Beau; I'm going to tap her and use--

03:19:53.378 --> 03:20:02.628
Where's my 1st-level spells? Is it Cure Wounds?

03:20:02.628 --> 03:20:04.217
MATT: Cure Wounds is the first level.

03:20:04.217 --> 03:20:06.308
TALIESIN: But I can cast it at a 2nd-level if I
have a 2nd-level left?

03:20:06.308 --> 03:20:08.146
MATT: You can.

03:20:08.146 --> 03:20:11.757
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds, but
because she's unconscious she gets all the hit

03:20:11.757 --> 03:20:13.829
points back, not just--

03:20:13.829 --> 03:20:17.023
[cheering]

03:20:18.848 --> 03:20:20.176
ASHLY: Oh my god!

03:20:20.176 --> 03:20:21.512
MATT: At what level?

03:20:21.512 --> 03:20:23.108
TALIESIN: You're at 21 hit points.

03:20:23.108 --> 03:20:24.359
MARISHA: Huh? What?!

03:20:24.359 --> 03:20:25.555
TALIESIN: You're at 21 hit points.

03:20:25.555 --> 03:20:27.611
MARISHA: Whoa!

03:20:28.984 --> 03:20:30.229
MATT: What level did you cast it at?

03:20:30.229 --> 03:20:31.620
TALIESIN: Level two.

03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:33.551
MATT: So it's 2d8--

03:20:33.551 --> 03:20:34.693
TALIESIN: Plus five.

03:20:34.693 --> 03:20:40.096
MATT: So 16 plus five-- yeah, that's-- Jesus, 21.
21 hit points!

03:20:40.096 --> 03:20:48.777
MARISHA: (gasps) What does Spare the Dying do?

03:20:48.777 --> 03:20:53.340
TALIESIN: It means he doesn't have to make death
saves at least for the moment, but probably could

03:20:53.340 --> 03:20:57.510
use some healing and I've already used all my
actions.

03:20:58.344 --> 03:21:02.738
MATT: Ending Caduceus' turn. Shakäste, you are
stable. You can still move if you want.

03:21:02.738 --> 03:21:05.577
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up against the one in
the corner so I have a little bit of cover.

03:21:05.577 --> 03:21:06.326
MATT: There?

03:21:06.326 --> 03:21:08.902
TALIESIN: No, the other corner. Yeah a little
coverage, there we are.

03:21:08.902 --> 03:21:12.442
MATT: There you go. Caduceus' turn's up. Shakäste,
you don't have to make any death saving throws

03:21:12.442 --> 03:21:16.450
because Spare the Dying, so you're fine, but
that's your turn. To the top of the round, Nott,

03:21:16.450 --> 03:21:17.398
you're up.

03:21:17.398 --> 03:21:34.674
SAM: Oh god, me? I guess I'll poke around and just
take a shot. I can't do anything else! I'll run in

03:21:34.674 --> 03:21:37.813
closer so I'm within 30 feet and then fire.

03:21:39.421 --> 03:21:44.355
I miss. Bonus action fire.

03:21:45.847 --> 03:21:47.021
18.

03:21:47.021 --> 03:21:49.228
MATT: 18 hits. Roll damage.

03:21:51.473 --> 03:21:53.241
SAM: That's nine points of damage.

03:21:53.241 --> 03:21:55.322
AUDIENCE: Nein!

03:21:55.980 --> 03:21:58.924
SAM: Then I'll run back to my cubbyhole.

03:22:03.261 --> 03:22:06.522
MATT: There goes Nott. That brings us to Beau!
What are you doing? You come to consciousness.

03:22:06.522 --> 03:22:08.462
You're prone. You have to use half your movement
to get up.

03:22:08.462 --> 03:22:14.410
MARISHA: I get up. Still have 20 feet of movement
left. Can I make it to Lorenzo?

03:22:14.410 --> 03:22:17.895
MATT: (counting)

03:22:17.895 --> 03:22:23.905
MARISHA: God, I'm so mad. How far away am I?

03:22:23.905 --> 03:22:26.699
MATT: You are ten feet from Lorenzo.

03:22:26.699 --> 03:22:32.862
MARISHA: God, that sucks! I'm going to use a ki
point to get there.

03:22:37.816 --> 03:22:41.473
(grunts) Step of the Wind.

03:22:43.096 --> 03:22:56.559
Hope that was a good call. I'm going to unleash on
him, because I'm fucking pissed. First attack.

03:22:56.559 --> 03:22:59.838
Uh-huh! Yep! 24.

03:22:59.838 --> 03:23:02.459
[cheering]

03:23:03.804 --> 03:23:05.343
MATT: Roll damage.

03:23:05.343 --> 03:23:07.798
MARISHA: All the rage and fury.

03:23:10.326 --> 03:23:12.421
And--

03:23:14.662 --> 03:23:26.230
I'm going to spend
my last ki point to do Stunning Strike.

03:23:33.199 --> 03:23:38.125
MATT: I'm going to use my little Shapeways dice for
this one.

03:23:40.338 --> 03:23:44.259
That's a plus six constitution modifier
on this one, but it rolled a natural four.

03:23:44.259 --> 03:23:49.493
[cheering]

03:23:49.493 --> 03:23:55.364
ASHLY: Hell yes! Oh my god!

03:23:55.364 --> 03:23:56.554
SAM: He's stunned?

03:23:56.724 --> 03:23:58.087
ASHLY: He's stunned.

03:23:58.347 --> 03:24:02.413
[cheering]

03:24:03.342 --> 03:24:11.081
ASHLY and AUDIENCE: (chanting) Beau!

03:24:11.464 --> 03:24:13.498
SAM: You're a golden god!

03:24:14.596 --> 03:24:22.420
MARISHA: I go full Ip Man on the next attack with
advantage. So everyone has advantage. Oh god, I

03:24:22.420 --> 03:24:25.537
thought it was a natural 20, but a 21 total!

03:24:25.537 --> 03:24:27.590
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

03:24:28.860 --> 03:24:31.313
MARISHA: Wait, did I do damage for the first one?

03:24:31.473 --> 03:24:32.803
AUDIENCE: No!

03:24:32.803 --> 03:24:34.549
MARISHA: No, okay.

03:24:34.816 --> 03:24:36.709
SAM: We need you guys every week.

03:24:38.449 --> 03:24:46.177
MARISHA: I'll use this for the first roll, which
will be seven points of damage. Yeah? Second roll.

03:24:47.448 --> 03:24:49.582
Ugh, that was a one.

03:24:49.854 --> 03:24:51.692
SAM: How do you want to do this?

03:24:51.692 --> 03:25:01.746
MARISHA: Five points of damage, and then my last
bonus action attack with advantage. Same roll, 13

03:25:01.746 --> 03:25:15.711
on both. No, a 16. I'll take that 16, plus seven?
That hits, and then eight damage. Pop-pop-pop!

03:25:21.491 --> 03:25:24.423
He's stunned for a round. Everyone has advantage?

03:25:24.423 --> 03:25:29.874
MATT: If anyone wants to physically attack him.
Yeah, in melee. Or actually, for stunned, attack

03:25:29.874 --> 03:25:31.319
rolls have advantage, yeah.

03:25:31.319 --> 03:25:33.435
MARISHA: Attack rolls.

03:25:34.843 --> 03:25:36.494
SAM: Lay it on.

03:25:36.494 --> 03:25:40.412
MATT: That's my fault for not having him fly to
the ceiling last turn.

03:25:40.808 --> 03:25:45.918
MARISHA: I turn around and with all the rage,
popping blood vessels, I say: (shouting) Fuck him up!

03:25:46.008 --> 03:25:50.884
[cheering]

03:25:51.888 --> 03:25:53.728
MATT: Caleb and Keg?

03:25:53.728 --> 03:25:55.406
LIAM: Okay. Ah--

03:26:01.555 --> 03:26:07.153
I would like to push myself up the
stairs as far as I can, while still being able to

03:26:07.153 --> 03:26:09.370
have a bead on him.

03:26:09.759 --> 03:26:11.934
MATT: Any higher up the stairs and you won't be
able to see him.

03:26:11.934 --> 03:26:21.677
LIAM: Okay. Then I will collapse onto my ass on
the stairs and make that symbol shape thing that

03:26:21.677 --> 03:26:29.043
Fjord used to make, and go: Ey, buddy. I will send
out another Fire Bolt.

03:26:29.043 --> 03:26:30.479
MATT: You have advantage on the attack roll.

03:26:30.479 --> 03:26:31.472
LIAM: Ja.

03:26:34.167 --> 03:26:35.903
That is a 16. 16.

03:26:37.873 --> 03:26:38.873
SAM: 16?

03:26:38.873 --> 03:26:45.898
MATT: 16? That hits, that just hits. Sorry, I was
doing math in my head.

03:26:46.068 --> 03:26:54.210
LIAM: No worries. That's six points of fire
damage, and I will now push myself up out of

03:26:54.210 --> 03:27:05.769
sight, up the stairs a little bit. It's going very
well. Shakäste will get to you any second.

03:27:09.084 --> 03:27:11.428
ASHLY: I would like to fuck him up, if I may? If I
could?

03:27:11.428 --> 03:27:14.390
[cheering]

03:27:16.702 --> 03:27:21.914
ASHLY: All right, here we go! Don't fuck me! Yes,
20, bam. Bing bam boom.

03:27:22.141 --> 03:27:24.411
MARISHA: They all have advantage, so roll twice.

03:27:24.411 --> 03:27:29.910
ASHLY: Oh, you are right. Okay, that was still
better. That's seven points of damage to start.

03:27:31.012 --> 03:27:34.504
Nope. Yep. 19, and I crit on a 19!

03:27:34.504 --> 03:27:39.396
[cheering]

03:27:41.640 --> 03:27:51.863
ASHLY: I forget what I do when I crit. I just
double it, okay. Oh, that's sad. Six. Bummer.

03:27:51.863 --> 03:27:56.157
Okay, here we go. Nope. 14 doesn't hit, does it?

03:27:56.157 --> 03:28:00.503
MATT: 14 does not hit. Unable to penetrate the
hide with that third strike. It hits the outside

03:28:00.503 --> 03:28:07.712
of the muscular blubber on his giant torso and it
shimmies and shakes and then tightens. All right,

03:28:07.712 --> 03:28:08.702
that ends your turn?

03:28:08.702 --> 03:28:09.952
ASHLY: That's that.

03:28:09.952 --> 03:28:18.172
MATT: All right, it is now Lorenzo's turn. Lorenzo
shrugs off the stun at the end, but can do nothing

03:28:18.172 --> 03:28:27.535
else on his turn, and is still locked. As soon as
he gets his ability to speak back, goes, "Oh,

03:28:27.535 --> 03:28:33.735
y'all being tricksy. I like it." That's going to
bring us to Caduceus.

03:28:33.735 --> 03:28:38.925
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over to Shakäste and
while I'm running, I'm going to use my bonus

03:28:38.925 --> 03:28:51.262
action to down a potion of healing, which is--
let's see if I'm doing this right. That's seven

03:28:51.262 --> 03:28:59.348
hit points that I regain. I should mark that as
used. Then once I'm there, I have to use an action

03:28:59.348 --> 03:29:00.839
to feed him a potion, correct?

03:29:00.839 --> 03:29:02.155
MATT: You do, yes.

03:29:02.155 --> 03:29:07.014
TALIESIN: Okay. Here's the question: does the
potion also get my bonus?

03:29:07.014 --> 03:29:08.979
MATT: No, because it's not your healing spell.

03:29:08.979 --> 03:29:11.811
TALIESIN: I figured not, but I thought it was
worth asking.

03:29:12.243 --> 03:29:14.577
MATT: (nasally voice) It's worth an inquiry. Most
definitely!

03:29:16.718 --> 03:29:18.913
ASHLY: I wish that was Lorenzo's voice.

03:29:23.105 --> 03:29:32.072
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you a potion, and
let's see what I roll. That's (counting) 15 hit

03:29:32.072 --> 03:29:40.469
points. You're awake again. I'm going to use the
rest of my movement to get some cover behind the

03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:46.943
table, I suppose, is the closest cover I've got
right now.

03:29:48.095 --> 03:29:53.000
MATT: You could push it. The table is righted now,
so it's an empty space.

03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.751
TALIESIN: I'm getting partial cover.

03:29:55.751 --> 03:29:59.362
MATT: Okay. I'll give you some cover on that.
Finishing Caduceus' turn, Shakäste, you are

03:29:59.362 --> 03:30:01.406
conscious now.

03:30:04.164 --> 03:30:06.654
TALIESIN: Smoke them if you got them, man.

03:30:07.382 --> 03:30:10.095
KHARY: I will use Mass Healing Word.

03:30:10.095 --> 03:30:15.416
[cheering]

03:30:17.162 --> 03:30:22.148
KHARY: Let's see. Up to six creatures of your
choice that you can see within range.

03:30:22.148 --> 03:30:31.640
MATT: What's the range? 60? You can see everybody
but Caleb. You can heal everybody but Caleb,

03:30:31.640 --> 03:30:39.263
because he went way up the stairs. You don't even
know where he is. You came to consciousness and

03:30:39.445 --> 03:30:41.216
Caleb's gone.

03:30:42.278 --> 03:30:45.794
KHARY: All right. Who's in need here?

03:30:45.794 --> 03:30:48.496
LIAM: This is going very well!

03:30:49.645 --> 03:30:51.902
SAM: You can't see me.

03:30:51.902 --> 03:30:59.810
KHARY: I say: Everybody that I can see, except
Caleb, gets mass healing!

03:31:04.622 --> 03:31:08.676
MATT: 1d4 plus your wisdom modifier, which is
four. So roll a d4.

03:31:10.008 --> 03:31:12.415
MARISHA: Big money, big money!

03:31:14.052 --> 03:31:15.438
That's good!

03:31:15.438 --> 03:31:17.088
LIAM: Seven total.

03:31:17.088 --> 03:31:18.686
MATT: How much?

03:31:18.686 --> 03:31:19.761
ASHLY: Seven?

03:31:19.761 --> 03:31:22.672
MATT: Everyone but Caleb heals seven hit points.

03:31:22.672 --> 03:31:26.874
TALIESIN: Seven points! Oh my god. I'm feeling a
little better.

03:31:27.345 --> 03:31:31.056
MATT: Are you going to stay put, Shakäste? Or are
you going to move somewhere?

03:31:31.056 --> 03:31:34.324
KHARY: Nefertiti is still floating, is she not?

03:31:34.324 --> 03:31:36.847
MATT: No, you lost her, unfortunately.

03:31:39.415 --> 03:31:41.257
SAM: Worst prop ever.

03:31:41.257 --> 03:31:44.663
KHARY: Still love you! Still love you!

03:31:46.766 --> 03:31:50.476
MATT: That's all right. You can still move if you
want to; it's up to you.

03:31:54.528 --> 03:32:04.888
KHARY: We should move away. I'm going to move back
into the testicle area. No, go around. Yeah, there

03:32:04.888 --> 03:32:07.944
you go. Then into the testicle.

03:32:08.095 --> 03:32:09.796
LIAM: Now cough.

03:32:09.796 --> 03:32:12.225
KHARY: Bring the Duchess with me.

03:32:12.434 --> 03:32:14.084
TALIESIN: Just cup around.

03:32:14.671 --> 03:32:17.675
MATT: All righty. That ends your go. Top of the
round: Nott, you're up first.

03:32:17.675 --> 03:32:22.716
SAM: I'll do the same thing. Poke out. Shoot. Is
Lorenzo engaged with anyone?

03:32:22.716 --> 03:32:25.853
MATT: He is engaged with both Beau and Keg.

03:32:25.853 --> 03:32:27.327
SAM: Okay. 19 to hit.

03:32:27.327 --> 03:32:29.102
MATT: That hits!

03:32:30.637 --> 03:32:39.828
SAM: Let's finish this. That is 17 points of
damage plus Fury of the Small--

03:32:42.799 --> 03:32:49.861
--make it 22. Then I'll shoot again!

03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:52.567
Nope, miss.

03:32:53.741 --> 03:33:00.370
MATT: That bolt impacts and now that you guys are
close enough, both Keg and Beau: as the bolt hits,

03:33:00.370 --> 03:33:07.519
the wear and tear in Lorenzo's form is really
starting to show. Wounds are-- they're still

03:33:07.519 --> 03:33:13.245
closing with each round that comes back to his go,
but the wounds' closing seems to be slowing, or at

03:33:13.245 --> 03:33:19.533
least the wounds are getting more and more deep
and dangerous. He's looking quite haggard and wounded.

03:33:20.257 --> 03:33:21.679
ASHLY: Fuck yes!

03:33:21.955 --> 03:33:23.523
MATT: Beau, you're up.

03:33:23.967 --> 03:33:29.282
MARISHA: All right, seeing where Nott just put a
bunch of bolts in him, I'm going to flat hand,

03:33:29.282 --> 03:33:32.832
palm the bolts right deeper into him.

03:33:32.832 --> 03:33:34.699
MATT: Go for it.

03:33:34.699 --> 03:33:37.482
MARISHA: First one. That is successful, 18.

03:33:37.482 --> 03:33:39.691
MATT: Yeah that hits, roll damage.

03:33:41.623 --> 03:33:51.660
MARISHA: Eight damage on first one. Second one,
that was cocked. One more time, same attack, 19,

03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:59.968
with another four, that's eight damage. Then I'm
going to just do one more with my offhand, I'm

03:33:59.968 --> 03:34:04.914
going to try and break his nose because that feels
personal.

03:34:09.145 --> 03:34:10.412
16?

03:34:10.412 --> 03:34:12.936
MATT: 16 just hits.

03:34:13.861 --> 03:34:15.820
MARISHA: And that's seven damage.

03:34:15.820 --> 03:34:19.929
MATT: Nice. He's looking real hurt.

03:34:23.979 --> 03:34:25.194
MARISHA: That's it.

03:34:25.194 --> 03:34:26.410
MATT: Keg?

03:34:26.410 --> 03:34:28.099
SAM: Yes.

03:34:28.099 --> 03:34:32.440
MARISHA: Keg!

03:34:35.810 --> 03:34:41.209
AUDIENCE: (chanting) Keg!

03:34:41.209 --> 03:34:42.077
SAM: Come on!

03:34:44.018 --> 03:34:46.182
ASHLY: Okay, here we go!

03:34:49.896 --> 03:34:52.181
Not a great start. 11.

03:34:52.181 --> 03:34:56.616
MATT: You go to swing, now being wounded and
looking-- a glare of desperation in the burning

03:34:56.616 --> 03:35:03.524
red eyes of Lorenzo. You swing and he grabs the
hilt of your weapon as it swings downward, and

03:35:03.524 --> 03:35:07.432
holds it aloft and in your face and goes, "Try
it."

03:35:08.098 --> 03:35:13.504
ASHLY: Okay! Fuck! Nine.

03:35:13.504 --> 03:35:16.045
AUDIENCE: Nein!

03:35:16.045 --> 03:35:22.363
MATT: No. The other hand grabs the other weapon,
and you're just locked in that moment now.

03:35:22.363 --> 03:35:23.702
ASHLY: Last one.

03:35:25.202 --> 03:35:27.622
MARISHA: Keg!

03:35:27.726 --> 03:35:30.649
ASHLY: Please! 17.

03:35:30.649 --> 03:35:33.622
MATT: That'll hit, roll damage.

03:35:34.450 --> 03:35:39.637
ASHLY: Okay, come on, come on, come on! Six?

03:35:40.907 --> 03:35:42.302
MATT: All righty.

03:35:42.302 --> 03:35:45.456
[groaning]

03:35:47.598 --> 03:35:50.845
ASHLY: (singing) I really wish I'd saved that
action surge.

03:35:50.845 --> 03:35:52.860
[cheering]

03:35:52.860 --> 03:35:55.491
ASHLY: No! I wish I had saved it.

03:35:55.491 --> 03:35:59.910
MATT: You wish you had saved it. She used it last
session and they didn't take a short rest. Sorry,

03:35:59.910 --> 03:36:01.012
guys.

03:36:01.012 --> 03:36:02.178
ASHLY: Sorry, sorry!

03:36:02.178 --> 03:36:03.366
MARISHA: That was so almost awesome!

03:36:03.366 --> 03:36:04.348
MATT: Caleb.

03:36:04.348 --> 03:36:11.067
LIAM: I mean, of course they're going to come for
you because you could have fucked off days ago but

03:36:11.067 --> 03:36:18.995
you're a big team player now! Oh, I better try to
hit that guy again. I will scooch down again. Oh,

03:36:18.995 --> 03:36:23.726
he's holding both of her blades. Okay, well, I
probably won't hit, but let's do it again, pew pew!

03:36:30.056 --> 03:36:31.564
That is a six-- 14.

03:36:31.894 --> 03:36:33.085
MATT: 14 does not hit.

03:36:33.085 --> 03:36:37.581
LIAM: Or is it? Hold on, let me double check,
because my iPad died and I can't see my shit.

03:36:38.876 --> 03:36:40.502
It's okay, everybody.

03:36:42.428 --> 03:36:43.180
It's 16.

03:36:43.302 --> 03:36:46.609
[cheering]

03:36:47.143 --> 03:36:48.703
MATT: Roll damage.

03:36:53.183 --> 03:36:55.002
LIAM: It's 11 points of damage.

03:36:55.002 --> 03:36:56.665
MATT: 11 points of damage.

03:36:57.444 --> 03:37:01.764
MARISHA and ASHLY: Come on, come on.

03:37:01.978 --> 03:37:04.142
TALIESIN: That's a lot of calculator.

03:37:06.129 --> 03:37:07.400
MATT: (quietly) Fuck.

03:37:11.147 --> 03:37:12.825
How do you want to do this?

03:37:12.927 --> 03:37:32.861
[cheering]

03:37:32.861 --> 03:37:41.487
AUDIENCE: (chanting) Caleb!

03:37:46.046 --> 03:37:54.726
LIAM: Oh, well fuck me running, it worked. I watch
it leave my finger and take an impossible

03:37:54.726 --> 03:38:02.144
spiralling trajectory through the air, and he's so
preoccupied with that charming dwarf woman with

03:38:02.144 --> 03:38:08.590
the stubble, it takes him in the back of the head
and it starts to burn through the back of his

03:38:08.590 --> 03:38:14.869
skull and eat away through the back of his head
and burn through his eyes!

03:38:14.869 --> 03:38:21.709
[cheering]

03:38:33.712 --> 03:38:35.329
ASHLY: What the fuck?!

03:38:37.495 --> 03:38:45.440
MATT: You watch as Lorenzo, in desperation, begins
to take flight. Both you and Beau try and swing

03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:52.220
for his form, but it doesn't matter at this point.
As he attempts to try and make for an exit, the

03:38:52.220 --> 03:38:57.588
flames curl across the body, leaving ash;
dissipating as the outer sides of his form begin

03:38:57.588 --> 03:39:05.380
to fall away into dust and blackened shale. As
both of your weapons and fists swing upward, they

03:39:05.380 --> 03:39:11.256
hit what feels like rock and scatter it like ash
against both sides of the walls. The torso falls

03:39:11.256 --> 03:39:19.640
and tumbles to the ground, one arm still dragging
Lorenzo towards the stairs in this last minute bit

03:39:19.640 --> 03:39:24.869
of desperation before it tumbles onto its back,
the flame curling and burning away the rest of his

03:39:24.869 --> 03:39:30.404
face and jaw. The hand left there limp before
that, eventually, is taken too, leaving nothing

03:39:30.404 --> 03:39:34.690
but charred charcoal behind.

03:39:34.690 --> 03:39:39.901
[cheering]

03:39:44.722 --> 03:39:47.554
LIAM: You shouldn't have killed my cat.

03:39:47.554 --> 03:39:50.666
[laughter]

03:40:01.497 --> 03:40:07.527
MATT: One tactical fuck up on his part and that
stunning strike turned that completely around.

03:40:07.527 --> 03:40:12.373
[cheering]

03:40:12.373 --> 03:40:13.620
TALIESIN: Monks, man.

03:40:22.626 --> 03:40:24.081
KHARY: I need a drink.

03:40:25.685 --> 03:40:27.861
TALIESIN: Hey, welcome back.

03:40:28.185 --> 03:40:31.275
ASHLY: Keg just falls to her knees and starts
crying.

03:40:32.885 --> 03:40:40.308
SAM: I go get some of the ash off the ground and
give it to Mr. Clay and say: Maybe you could make

03:40:40.308 --> 03:40:42.751
some tea with this?

03:40:46.809 --> 03:40:49.685
TALIESIN: Do I get any sense of what this is? I'm
going to do Detect Undead, I'm going to see if I

03:40:49.685 --> 03:40:51.867
can understand what he was.

03:40:51.867 --> 03:40:55.993
MATT: Go ahead and make an arcana check.

03:40:57.472 --> 03:40:59.405
LIAM: Also, in the meantime, DM, I--

03:40:59.405 --> 03:41:00.297
TALIESIN: 16.

03:41:00.297 --> 03:41:04.104
MATT: Definitely don't want to make tea from this.

03:41:04.104 --> 03:41:06.959
TALIESIN: I figured.

03:41:07.564 --> 03:41:14.643
MATT: There are certain creatures that are, you
would assume, distantly related to giant kin.

03:41:14.643 --> 03:41:21.147
You're used to seeing the ogre-ish, mighty beasts.
This was something entirely different. You've

03:41:21.147 --> 03:41:30.182
heard terms thrown around, like "ogre mage," but
this is commonly referred to in children's nursery

03:41:30.182 --> 03:41:36.272
rhymes-- the kind that are meant to scare kids
from going out at night-- as an oni.

03:41:39.999 --> 03:41:44.337
TALIESIN: I don't know if there's much we can do
with this. This is a bit-- yeah, no, you don't

03:41:44.337 --> 03:41:49.189
want to drink that. Let's sweep that away, why
don't we?

03:41:50.409 --> 03:42:00.150
MARISHA: Beau is going to immediately run over
here to this undiscovered prison ballsack region.

03:42:00.494 --> 03:42:03.725
SAM: There's four balls on this dick.

03:42:06.065 --> 03:42:13.052
MATT: You glance inside that additional chamber
and you can now see, within that chamber, there is

03:42:13.052 --> 03:42:17.494
a singular figure on the opposite side of the
wall, chained up. Your eyes adjust and you pull

03:42:17.494 --> 03:42:27.079
the candelabra close and you can see the familiar
dark gray leather and white hair of a chained and

03:42:27.079 --> 03:42:29.302
unconscious Yasha on the far end.

03:42:29.302 --> 03:42:35.010
[cheering]

03:42:36.850 --> 03:42:41.632
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and start figuring out
how to open that other gate that I'm next to.

03:42:41.632 --> 03:42:45.687
MATT: Go ahead and make a check. Do you have
thieves' tools?

03:42:45.687 --> 03:42:53.121
TALIESIN: No, I was just going to hit it with my
stick until the lock broke, or hit the lock with

03:42:53.121 --> 03:42:56.063
Sacred Flame or something fun. Just blow it.

03:42:56.063 --> 03:43:01.341
MATT: You take a while with it before you realize
this particular type of metal seems to be made to

03:43:01.341 --> 03:43:03.820
endure such spells.

03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:06.508
SAM: I can help a little, if--

03:43:06.508 --> 03:43:07.302
TALIESIN: Oh, really?

03:43:07.302 --> 03:43:08.583
SAM: Oh yeah.

03:43:08.583 --> 03:43:11.621
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I want to watch. This looks
like fun.

03:43:11.621 --> 03:43:13.678
SAM: I don't do well in crowds.

03:43:16.536 --> 03:43:17.914
Natural 20.

03:43:17.914 --> 03:43:22.304
[cheering]

03:43:27.065 --> 03:43:30.322
TALIESIN: That was so cool. Wow.

03:43:30.322 --> 03:43:34.844
MATT: That little boost of confidence was just
enough for you to find every tumbler within one

03:43:34.844 --> 03:43:41.091
quick attempt, and with a swift (click and creak)
it hangs open to the inside.

03:43:41.091 --> 03:43:43.078
TALIESIN: After you.

03:43:43.078 --> 03:43:47.015
SAM: Oh, thank you. I'll go in there.

03:43:47.015 --> 03:43:58.524
MATT: There you see three figures. You see one
that appears to be an older woman, chained and

03:43:58.524 --> 03:44:02.209
gagged. This is a familiar pattern with all of
these. You can see they've dealt with magic users

03:44:02.209 --> 03:44:06.478
and people who have special abilities in the past,
so as a precaution they do this to every prisoner

03:44:06.478 --> 03:44:17.349
they can. There you see on the ground as well a
familiar blue-haired, horned ally as well as a

03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:23.160
taller, more rugged half-orc friend.

03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:28.008
[cheering]

03:44:32.476 --> 03:44:36.927
LIAM: I have a question. I don't know if the
situation calls for it-- I rolled a voluntary

03:44:36.927 --> 03:44:39.501
wisdom save for--

03:44:39.887 --> 03:44:41.683
MATT: Thank you for reminding me.

03:44:41.683 --> 03:44:43.843
LIAM: Ja, but I rolled an 18, so it's a 21.

03:44:43.843 --> 03:44:45.655
MATT: Okay.

03:44:48.813 --> 03:44:55.342
SAM: I'll just run over to Jester and give her a
hug and just say: Case closed.

03:44:55.342 --> 03:44:59.181
AUDIENCE: Aww!

03:45:04.132 --> 03:45:06.520
MARISHA: They're all unconscious?

03:45:06.520 --> 03:45:16.387
MATT: They're all unconscious, yeah. At this point
you can see, coming down the stairs behind you,

03:45:16.387 --> 03:45:26.238
Caleb, the older fellow that you had saved earlier
with the swollen eye. Behind him, the dwarf and

03:45:26.238 --> 03:45:36.211
the child. He seems to have been able to free them
from the cage, and they come down and say, "Is it

03:45:36.211 --> 03:45:38.996
over? Is it safe?"

03:45:38.996 --> 03:45:42.095
LIAM: It's better than it was.

03:45:42.766 --> 03:45:53.854
KHARY: It will be. It's absolutely better than it
was, but I think you should thank these people who

03:45:53.854 --> 03:45:59.748
came down into the catacombs. This is the second
time that I've come across these people and

03:45:59.748 --> 03:46:09.837
they've gone from fresh air into dark, dank air
for no other reason than to find people and to

03:46:09.837 --> 03:46:17.576
help them out. They're special as far as I'm
concerned and you should remember them. So what do

03:46:17.576 --> 03:46:19.255
we call you?

03:46:22.398 --> 03:46:23.766
SAM: Us?

03:46:23.766 --> 03:46:28.367
KHARY: Yeah, you! I mean, you're obviously--

03:46:32.567 --> 03:46:36.095
MARISHA: I think we're all still The Mighty Nein.

03:46:38.024 --> 03:46:41.764
[cheering]

03:46:46.306 --> 03:46:50.386
MARISHA: The Mighty Nein seems pretty amorphous at
this point.

03:46:51.814 --> 03:46:58.885
LIAM: You know, we thought it would be a joke in
the beginning, it kind of stuck. It doesn't make

03:46:58.885 --> 03:47:06.507
any sense. I'm going to go sit on the table that
got knocked all over the place during that fight

03:47:06.507 --> 03:47:11.133
and sit and just stare at the three unconscious
and feel very tired.

03:47:12.953 --> 03:47:20.608
MARISHA: Shakäste, did you say something about
making all this better than what it was?

03:47:22.332 --> 03:47:27.008
KHARY: Well, that's what I've been trying to do.
I've been doing it a long time on my own; it feels

03:47:27.008 --> 03:47:30.089
good to know that there are other people out here
doing the same.

03:47:30.089 --> 03:47:31.913
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:47:31.913 --> 03:47:36.682
KHARY: You know? It can get a little crazy talking
to a little bird all the time.

03:47:38.772 --> 03:47:42.156
MATT: (buzzing) onto your shoulder.

03:47:42.666 --> 03:47:47.163
ASHLY: What did you say to me, Nott? Some are
people are just good?

03:47:47.895 --> 03:47:52.995
SAM: Maybe? I may have been drunk at the time.

03:47:52.995 --> 03:47:55.506
[laughter]

03:47:56.877 --> 03:47:59.044
ASHLY: I was, too.

03:47:59.418 --> 03:48:08.754
TALIESIN: I mean, really? People aren't good.
That's not how this works. I mean, things that you

03:48:08.754 --> 03:48:17.007
do are good or bad, but people are just people.
You guys keep doing good things, and all I've seen

03:48:17.007 --> 03:48:22.276
is you doing good things. I'm not sure what the
confusion is about.

03:48:24.347 --> 03:48:27.004
SAM: Well, we used to be-- no, you're right.

03:48:27.004 --> 03:48:29.638
[laughter]

03:48:32.097 --> 03:48:34.181
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

03:48:35.769 --> 03:48:43.678
KHARY: Every once in a while, I run into people,
and I find that a lot of people do a lot of

03:48:43.678 --> 03:48:52.661
talking, but I've always found it's the people who
hush and do good things are the best ones. I'd say

03:48:52.661 --> 03:49:00.332
that you're in that class. If you ever hear the
word "hush," know that I'm close. I'm going to

03:49:00.332 --> 03:49:03.931
take these people and get them back to where they
belong.

03:49:05.056 --> 03:49:11.498
SAM: Thank you, Shakäste. Oh, here. I stole a
bunch of gold from you last time.

03:49:11.498 --> 03:49:18.439
[laughter]

03:49:19.926 --> 03:49:29.740
SAM: But that's when we were bad people, and now I
guess we're good now? So here. It was about 20, 25 gold.

03:49:33.171 --> 03:49:41.910
KHARY: Whether you realize it or not, I gave you
that gold. People don't take money from Shakäste.

03:49:41.910 --> 03:49:47.774
[cheering]

03:49:49.955 --> 03:49:52.453
KHARY: Spend it on something you like.

03:49:52.453 --> 03:49:53.673
SAM: Thank you.

03:49:53.673 --> 03:49:54.828
KHARY: Thank you.

03:49:54.828 --> 03:49:56.723
SAM: (quickly) You're very handsome.

03:49:58.451 --> 03:50:03.182
ASHLY: Are both cages open at this point, or just
the one?

03:50:03.182 --> 03:50:06.418
MATT: One is open, the other is still closed.

03:50:06.418 --> 03:50:10.799
MARISHA: We still haven't found your partner. He's
not here yet, right?

03:50:13.219 --> 03:50:18.855
ASHLY: It was a pie in the sky thing. I'm sure
he's long gone.

03:50:20.527 --> 03:50:22.892
MARISHA: Let's open the other cage.

03:50:22.892 --> 03:50:25.096
KHARY: You never can tell.

03:50:25.635 --> 03:50:28.541
ASHLY: All right. I can't.

03:50:28.541 --> 03:50:30.458
KHARY: I'll go ahead.

03:50:30.458 --> 03:50:33.102
SAM: Oh! I'll assist.

03:50:35.326 --> 03:50:37.486
KHARY: 17 plus--

03:50:38.066 --> 03:50:45.235
MATT: Yeah, that'll do it. It opens up, and on the
inside of the chamber there is just Yasha.

03:50:47.731 --> 03:50:49.027
ASHLY: It's all right.

03:50:49.027 --> 03:50:50.513
KHARY: I'm sorry.

03:50:53.582 --> 03:50:56.508
ASHLY: Let's get your friends out of here, huh?

03:50:59.219 --> 03:51:01.430
MARISHA: What are you going to do?

03:51:01.430 --> 03:51:03.313
ASHLY: Sorry?

03:51:03.313 --> 03:51:06.489
MARISHA: Are you going to keep looking?

03:51:06.489 --> 03:51:12.683
ASHLY: I don't know what I'm going to do. I've
only been thinking about killing that son of a

03:51:12.683 --> 03:51:26.427
bitch now. I don't really know what my life is
going to be like. I'll probably go on a nice

03:51:26.427 --> 03:51:32.652
drunken bender for a while, and then when I come
to, I'll figure something out.

03:51:33.399 --> 03:51:36.944
LIAM: Do either of you want to come with?

03:51:37.369 --> 03:51:41.136
MARISHA: At least for a drunken bender. Tonight,
you want to stay with me?

03:51:41.136 --> 03:51:44.904
[cheering]

03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:56.305
MARISHA: You can sneak out in the morning, if you
want. It won't be weird.

03:52:02.839 --> 03:52:05.498
ASHLY: Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, totally!

03:52:09.328 --> 03:52:11.234
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

03:52:13.934 --> 03:52:17.797
MARISHA: What was it Shakäste just said? Get
yourself something nice?

03:52:22.559 --> 03:52:25.626
ASHLY: You know what is happening. Keg is
aroused.

03:52:26.914 --> 03:52:32.792
MATT: Gathering up the rest of those who were
captured by the Iron Shepherds, Shakäste shepherds

03:52:32.792 --> 03:52:39.277
them off to their proper locations, free and far
from the confines, outside of the Dwendalian

03:52:39.277 --> 03:52:49.885
Empire. The rest of you, with your friends in tow,
make your way back towards Shadycreek Run and to

03:52:49.885 --> 03:52:57.023
the rest of the morning light, which now begins to
slowly curl over the distant mountains. A long

03:52:57.023 --> 03:53:07.890
evening, exhausted and tired. You look forward to
enjoying comfort, alcohol, and whatever else

03:53:07.890 --> 03:53:10.491
transpired thereafter.

03:53:10.862 --> 03:53:12.959
ASHLY: Sex. It's sex. It's lots of sex.

03:53:12.959 --> 03:53:18.550
[cheering]

03:53:21.863 --> 03:53:25.972
MATT: All right. Well then, we're going to finish
tonight's episode there.

03:53:25.972 --> 03:54:29.217
[cheering]

03:54:29.217 --> 03:54:37.174
KHARY: You know what, hold on! Take a bow! Come
around and take a bow. That's how you do it.

03:54:46.192 --> 03:55:04.594
[cheering]

03:55:05.247 --> 03:55:14.212
MATT: Thank you all so very much for coming and
for watching. Man, he was supposed to get away.

03:55:14.212 --> 03:55:17.914
[laughter]

03:55:18.799 --> 03:55:30.641
MATT: Ugh! Well done. Hey, sometimes I kill a
party member, sometimes you kill mine. I guess it

03:55:30.641 --> 03:55:39.533
works out well. But no, in all seriousness, guys,
this is perpetually, continuously becoming a more

03:55:39.533 --> 03:55:44.405
and more surreal experience. This wonderful game
with wonderful friends.

03:55:44.405 --> 03:55:50.378
[cheering]

03:55:50.998 --> 03:55:56.345
MATT: There aren't words to describe how much this
crazy phenomenon of family means to us, and thank

03:55:56.345 --> 03:56:02.617
you for your support, your engagement, your
support and engagement of each other. This is a

03:56:02.617 --> 03:56:07.364
testament to a new era in storytelling that we all
get to share in.

03:56:08.327 --> 03:56:32.137
[cheering]

03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:38.179
MATT: Thank you, Khary, for coming and joining us
for the live episode.

03:56:38.179 --> 03:56:43.467
[cheering]

03:56:43.762 --> 03:56:48.633
MATT: Pretty much came straight here from being in
the UK this past weekend, so he was barely home

03:56:48.633 --> 03:56:54.047
and then flew back out to be here with us. Hiding
the whole day so nobody would see him, so he could

03:56:54.047 --> 03:57:00.576
make the surprise drop. Thank you so much. Ashly,
thank you for coming along with us for this crazy journey.

03:57:00.737 --> 03:57:15.521
[cheering]

03:57:23.673 --> 03:57:27.433
MATT: I'm just rambling now. You guys are amazing,
thank you for coming. Hope you have a wonderful

03:57:27.433 --> 03:57:34.758
night. We have our panel tomorrow. Go check out
The Invulnerable Vagrant at Gen Con. Love you

03:57:34.758 --> 03:57:41.983
guys, and is it Thursday yet? Good night.

03:57:41.983 --> 03:58:04.445

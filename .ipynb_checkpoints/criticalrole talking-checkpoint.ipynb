Since it is our first episode of\\nthe year, of the campaign, I want to make sure\\nthat we get our announcements out of the way.\\nWe've got some cool stuff to talk about. First and\\nforemost, we have two sponsors tonight. Our first\\nsponsor-- and we're going into, for a time, a cool\\npartnership with the folks at DnD Beyond,\\nactually. They've been really awesome, and we've\\nbeen talking, and anybody who hasn't seen it, it's\\nan online digital tool where you can create your\\nown D&amp;D character, they have options to purchase\\nany of the current D&amp;D books out there, and then\\ncarry over any of the character options and racial\\noptions over into it, so you can basically use it\\nas a tool. We'll be using it to help us out in the\\ngame as we go, 'cause it's actually got some pretty\\ncool stuff. So excited about that. It is D-N-D\\nBeyond, by the way, if you haven't seen, not the\\nampersand. It's D-N-D.>,\n",

They should have\\navailable the Blood Hunter class that I created a\\ncouple of years ago, kind of refining. Should be\\navailable for you guys to find on the DnD Beyond,\\nwhich I'm excited about, and there's a one-time\\ndiscount of $10 off any digital book in the\\ndndbeyond.com marketplace if you use the codeword\\n'beginnings' in there right now.

There's a bunch of stuff to\\nexplore on there, and a bunch of cool ways to\\nincorporate the existing breadth of D&amp;D lore and\\noptions in there, and now you have some of our stuff in\\nthere as well, and hopefully more Critical Role\\ncontent and Tal'Dorei content and Exandria content\\ndown the road to also be available on there as we\\ngo.

This continent is divided both\\nby jagged terrain and political powers. The\\nMenagerie Coast, a collection of city-states\\nunited under the Clovis Concord, monopolizes the\\nsouthwestern shores and ports of Wildemount,\\nthriving on open trade and cultural freedom.\\nBeyond the Cyrios Mountains lies the massive\\nregion known as Wynandir, bisected by the\\nAshkeeper Peaks. Eastern Wynandir houses the\\nexpansive wastes and turbulent badlands of\\nXhorhas, overrun with all manner of beasts and\\nterrors, relics from the final battles of the\\nCalamity that ruined that scarred landscape.\\nNorthward, you would find the Greying Wildlands, a\\nlawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it\\nunconquered by human hands. However, this story\\nbegins in the territory of Western Wynandir,\\nwithin the boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire.\\nEmerging 13 generations before, the Dwendalian\\nEmpire has slowly spread to encompass the\\nsurrounding societies of the region, absorbing the\\npeoples of the Zemni Fields and the Marrow Valley,\\nbefore finally conquering the Julous Dominion and\\ntaking the whole of Western Wynandir for the\\nEmpire.>,\n",
       "  <Caption start=00:18:08.104 end=00:20:17.780 text=MATT: No. This is-- let me continue. Under the\\nrule of the current King Bertrand Dwendal, now in\\nhis 68th year, most are left to their own devices.\\nYou live as you did before. The crown only takes a\\ntithe of what you produce and earn. You follow its\\nlaws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed\\nlocal leadership. In return, denizens of the\\nEmpire are protected from the chaotic horrors and\\nshadowed evils that stalk the edges of the\\ncivilized lands. This accord has led to a\\nprosperous century for the Empire, or at least the\\npolitical elite. Tensions brew beneath the\\nchafing watch of the Crown's Guard. Every temple\\nis government-owned and run, and worship outside\\nthe approved idolatry is met with imprisonment.\\nRumors of military clashes at the eastern border\\nnear Xhorhas have many common folk on edge. Our\\nstory, however, begins much smaller. Here in the\\nsouthern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the\\nentry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small\\nrural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue\\nwaters of the Ustaloch, this town came to\\nprominence near the turn of this recent century,\\nwhen the surrounding fertile farmlands were\\ndiscovered to produce a unique type of grain and\\nwheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the\\nglut subsided, three large families stood\\ntriumphant in the local business of fermented\\ndelights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports\\nof fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade\\nstop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering\\ndestinies slowly begin to intersect.\\nWe begin in the early hours of the morning on the\\nday of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor\\nof the Nestled Nook Inn. A bleary-eyed, bruised\\nman in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his\\nlengthy sleep, catching his small, snoring ally\\ncurled at the foot of the bed. Liam, if you would\\nlike to describe your character, please.>,\n",

       "  <Caption start=00:25:15.133 end=00:25:25.268 text=MATT: At this point, you notice the gentle smell\\nof cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge\\nand eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the\\nsubtle floor of your room, meet your nostrils.>,\n",

The southern, more rural\\nregion of the Empire, especially near Felderwin,\\nwhich is one of the largest tilling and farming\\nareas of the entire Empire, has a very heavy\\nhalfling population. And so while this city is not\\nthe core of it, you'd probably see a larger 20-25%\\nof the population here in Trostenwald is halfling.\\nSo you pass off pretty decently as long as you\\nkeep away from discerning, intent eyes. So the two\\nof you manage to gather your things for the time\\nbeing, wander down the stairs from the top floor\\ndown to the base of the tavern, which, the air is\\nalready bustling with townsfolk and all manner of\\ntravelers preparing to take on the day's\\nresponsibilities. Yorda, the 40-something woman\\nbarkeep with shoulder-length blonde hair and\\nweathered skin that you previously rented your\\nroom at the inn from, frantically darts behind the\\nbar while the red-headed barmaid rushes from table\\nto table. It seems that the clientele is a bit\\nmore than they were expecting this morning. Yorda\\nyells from behind the bar to the barkeep,\\n\"Adelaine, two more brats and a bit of mush at the\\ncorner table.\" She looks up, \"I'm working on it!\"\\nAnd she runs over and heads back to the kitchen.\\nThere's a faint bit of music as two\\nslovenly-looking musicians in the corner are\\ntrying to work for tips with a small hat on the\\nfloor that it looks like nobody's thrown any coin\\ninto it.

A tall half-orc masculine\\nman with a well-groomed handlebar mustache that\\ncurves out to the side, billowing white silk shirt\\nand black trousers, follows behind with a big drum\\nslung over his shoulder, going (drumming) along with the\\nfiddle. The tiefling man of lavender skin that you\\nsaw earlier walks along with a grin, juggling two\\ncurved scimitars as he walks in place, almost\\nloses one and catches it, continues to go.\\nFamilies are beginning to gather out to see this\\ndisplay. The two dancers part, and then a woman of\\nshort, fiery red hair and dark skin walking\\nbetween them, lifting a small candle before--\\nfwoosh! A giant burst, a gout of flame emerges\\nfrom the front of her mouth, brightens the\\nvicinity, and everyone collectively gasps and\\nbegins cheering and clapping as they continue the\\nwalk. There, to the back of it, you see the rather\\nburly-looking pale woman, arms crossed, just\\nfollowing behind and keeping an eye like a\\nsecurity guard to ensure that no business gets out\\nof hand. The gasps and the cheers begin to follow,\\nand as the procession continues down its way, the\\nfamilies and civilians begin to gather and follow\\nbehind. As the last bit of the sun sets behind the\\nmountain range, the torches glowing, the\\nprocession curves through the center of the Loch\\nWard to the edge of the Ustaloch itself. Through\\nthe fishing village, more folks begin to gather.\\nDo you all follow?>,\n",

The procession continues\\ntowards the eastern side, out along the southern\\nedge of this Loch Ward, to the Ustaloch's\\nsouthern place, towards the new, completely\\nconstructed, large, dark blue tent. Lengthy\\nstreamers of white and silver flap with the cold\\nwinds from the top of the structure.

The familiar sound of the\\nfiddle begins to play, and everyone quickly gets\\nquiet, down to a hush. The music seems sourceless\\nin the interior of the tent. Everyone begins to\\nlook around to see where it may come from. You\\nhear points of hushed \"look\"s, pointing off in\\ndifferent areas, and at the top of the tent, you\\nsee, seeming to stretch and fall, like a slow drop\\nof water, the man in red you saw earlier descends\\nfrom the top of the tent, but now dressed\\nhead-to-toe in a matching deep blue outfit and\\nfull makeup, to where he appears out of the canopy\\nof the tent.

It's a\\nvery strange but alluring sight, and you can't\\nhelp but notice that you forget that these are two\\nhalfling girls, and you find yourself pulled into\\nthis wordless story they tell of climbing back to\\ntheir place, to the surface, towards the dark sky\\nof lightless blue cloth. As the baubles that\\ncontain the interior light of the tent begin to\\nglow brighter and brighter, their climbing becomes\\nmore fevered. The two of them, arm into arm, leg\\ninto leg, rolling up and swirling, until\\neventually at the apex they grab each other's arms\\naround the pole before spinning downward,\\nback-to-back, legs outward, with a rapid pace, the\\nmusic coming to a full crescendo.

The\\ncrowd audibly gasps as one, the entrancing song of\\nthis girl bringing every person into this music.\\nThe devil-toad stops struggling against the\\nchains, seemingly caught by the sound of her\\nvoice. Its face drops into a soft smile as it\\nslowly walks towards the base of the pole and\\nsits. The half-orc and the fool drop the chains and\\nback away, leaving the beast free in its rapture.\\nHer voice almost begins to summon a chorus from\\nthe ether, magical in nature, as there are no\\nothers but her joining into this piece. Her smile\\nis infectious, and you can't tear your eyes away.\\nYou only now realize the tears down your cheeks,\\nbut you cannot break your gaze. From the front row\\nof the audience, on the left, a man stands up, his\\narms outstretched towards her. His dirtied cloak\\nfalls away, his face and skin wracked with age.\\nYou see his legs shaking as he stands, his cheeks\\nwet with tears. He shouts (exclaims). His arms\\ndrop and clutch his chest. Gurgles a burst of vocal pain\\nonce more, and folks nearest to him begin to lean\\naway as he begins to shake. You glance over as the\\nold man yells out once more, as the skin on his\\narms suddenly begins to tear, the bones splitting\\nfrom the flesh, writhing, cracking. Dust and blood\\nshake from his wounds as his form swells. Screams\\nbegin to ring out from the audience around him,\\npeople rising up and running for the exit. Chaos\\nbreaks into the room around you. Toya's song\\nabruptly ends, the little girl looking down with\\nfright in her eyes, the devil-toad glancing about\\nworriedly, the half-orc and the fool rushing up\\nbeside him to look at the transforming man. The\\nhalf-orc yells, escorting patrons to the exit,\\n\"Everyone! Leave the tent now! Kylre--\" As he\\npoints to the devil-toad. \"--get her to safety.\"\\nThe devil-toad glances up and leaps with a sudden\\ngust of strength to the top and grabs the center\\npole of the room as it begins to almost quiver to\\nhis weight. He grabs the little girl safely under\\nhis arm and leaps back down. What are you all doing?>,\n",

Under the\\nrule of the current King Bertrand Dwendal, now in\\nhis 68th year, most are left to their own devices.\\nYou live as you did before. The crown only takes a\\ntithe of what you produce and earn. You follow its\\nlaws, worship its gods, and bow to its installed\\nlocal leadership. In return, denizens of the\\nEmpire are protected from the chaotic horrors and\\nshadowed evils that stalk the edges of the\\ncivilized lands. This accord has led to a\\nprosperous century for the Empire, or at least the\\npolitical elite. Tensions brew beneath the\\nchafing watch of the Crown's Guard. Every temple\\nis government-owned and run, and worship outside\\nthe approved idolatry is met with imprisonment.\\nRumors of military clashes at the eastern border\\nnear Xhorhas have many common folk on edge. Our\\nstory, however, begins much smaller. Here in the\\nsouthern reaches of the Marrow Valley, beyond the\\nentry gates of the Wuyun Gorge, lies the small\\nrural town of Trostenwald. Bordering the blue\\nwaters of the Ustaloch, this town came to\\nprominence near the turn of this recent century,\\nwhen the surrounding fertile farmlands were\\ndiscovered to produce a unique type of grain and\\nwheat, leading to a boom of breweries. When the\\nglut subsided, three large families stood\\ntriumphant in the local business of fermented\\ndelights. Now Trostenwald thrives on their exports\\nof fish, crops, and ale. Here in this sleepy trade\\nstop along the Amber Road, a handful of wandering\\ndestinies slowly begin to intersect.\\nWe begin in the early hours of the morning on the\\nday of Grissen in a messy room on the second floor\\nof the Nestled Nook Inn. A bleary-eyed, bruised\\nman in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his\\nlengthy sleep, catching his small, snoring ally\\ncurled at the foot of the bed.

You\\nhear points of hushed \"look\"s, pointing off in\\ndifferent areas, and at the top of the tent, you\\nsee, seeming to stretch and fall, like a slow drop\\nof water, the man in red you saw earlier descends\\nfrom the top of the tent, but now dressed\\nhead-to-toe in a matching deep blue outfit and\\nfull makeup, to where he appears out of the canopy\\nof the tent. He hangs from a rope by one foot,\\nit's wrapped around and clutched as his foot\\ncatches the edge. Playing his violin\\never-so-slowly as he carefully descends, and then\\nat the last moment releases the rope and lands on\\nhis feet, continuing the music he's playing. He\\nslowly spins as the longer-haired elf leader of\\nthe earlier parade that you saw, the one that had\\nmarked back briefly to your two new friends over\\nhere, enters the tent from the distant flaps, the\\nperformers' entrance, his head now sporting that\\nsame tall hat, flopping backwards at the apex. He\\nextends his arms, removing the hat, and takes a\\ndeep bow as the crowd begins to clap.>,\n",

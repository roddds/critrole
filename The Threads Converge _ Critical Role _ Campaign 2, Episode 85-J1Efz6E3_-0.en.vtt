00:00:00.052 --> 00:00:01.930
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.834
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:05.621
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:08.379
TRAVIS: Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:09.212
MARISHA: That was nice, you guys.

6
00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:12.925
MATT: That was (stammering)... that was a thing.

7
00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:14.484
So before we jump into tonight's

8
00:00:14.484 --> 00:00:16.534
already starting off crazy episode,

9
00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:17.610
we have a few announcements to get through,

10
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.118
beginning with our fantastic sponsors for the night,

11
00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:21.738
the first one, our friends,

12
00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:23.970
since the beginning of this fantastic storyline,

13
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.803
D&amp;D Beyond.

14
00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:26.199
Sam?
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond ♪

15
00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.094
SAM: (like Morty) Ah, oh Brick,

16
00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:33.471
I've made a major discovery!

17
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:36.792
LIAM: (like Rick) Look, whatever it is, make it fast, Sorty.

18
00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:39.067
My life expectancy is shorter than your pubes.

19
00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:42.103
SAM: Okay, listen, D&amp;D Beyond wants you to know

20
00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:44.626
about a brand-new rule and adventure book,

21
00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:47.174
Dungeons and Dragons Vs. Rick and Morty,

22
00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:51.687
releasing next week on Tuesday, November 19th!

23
00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:54.716
LIAM: DNA was a major discovery, Sorty, okay?

24
00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:57.451
Nuclear fusion was a major discovery.

25
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:58.585
Another Rick and Morty promo

26
00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:01.007
is more like an unexpected taco burp.

27
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:02.438
Momentarily pleasurable,

28
00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:04.374
but about as rare as Matt Mercer dropping the words

29
00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.133
"toothy maw" with tabletop game.

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.643
(laughter)

31
00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:10.516
SAM: Okay, but don't you get it?

32
00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:13.852
Oh Brick, you can play D&amp;D through the lens

33
00:01:13.852 --> 00:01:15.723
of the mad genius Rick Sanchez

34
00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:17.541
from the animated cartoon series,

35
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:20.046
and find out what happens when his high-power

36
00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.483
gaming sensibilities and sarcastic meta commentary

37
00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.547
are paired with the world of D&amp;D.

38
00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:28.047
That's pretty cool, right?

39
00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:30.415
LIAM: Sarcastic meta commentary?

40
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.958
Sounds like Sam "Pay-Attention-To-Me" Riegel would do

41
00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.375
in one of his D&amp;D Beyond "ads."

42
00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:39.128
SAM: Okay, Brick, just shut the fuck up and listen!

43
00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:40.811
You can pre-order now, and it'll appear

44
00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:43.976
in your D&amp;D Beyond account on the 19th!

45
00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:45.355
LIAM: Sorty, the only account I have

46
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.867
is on Pornhub, thank you very much.

47
00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.428
(laughter)

48
00:01:48.428 --> 00:01:49.716
Now, if you've shot your wad here,

49
00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:51.815
let's (burps) end this bit.

50
00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:53.390
(laughter)

51
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.533
I have a one-shot to run in an alternate timeline

52
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.487
that's 10% less fucked-up than this one.

53
00:01:57.487 --> 00:01:58.320
Chop-chop!
SAM: Okay,

54
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.986
find out more and order

55
00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:02.709
at dndbeyond.link/rickandmorty!

56
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.455
LIAM: Wubba lubba dub dub!

57
00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.420
(laughter)

58
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.795
TRAVIS: Yes!

59
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.296
Oh, five stars!

60
00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.178
(clapping)

61
00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:14.500
Some of your best.

62
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.663
Recast for Morty, but Rick was fucking great.

63
00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:19.719
(laughter)

64
00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.529
MATT: Roiland's still has a job, then, there you go.

65
00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.918
TALIESIN: This is the amusement park Rick and Morty.

66
00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:31.703
MATT: The bad hire-able birthday actors Rick and Morty.

67
00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:33.412
Thank you very much, D&amp;D Beyond,

68
00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:36.355
for your fantastic continued sponsorship

69
00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.285
and friendliness to our story.

70
00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:41.221
Our second sponsor tonight is Ten Speed Press.

71
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.709
For those guys who haven't seen,

72
00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.543
they've been releasing their young D&amp;D adventurers guide

73
00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:47.866
series, it's awesome.

74
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.446
It's a rules-free introduction to D&amp;D

75
00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:53.194
specifically made for young and new players

76
00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:55.209
that really emphasizes the creative elements

77
00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.342
of playing the game and creating characters

78
00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:58.868
and running a story, that makes the experience

79
00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:01.636
so special, and without being too technical

80
00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:02.535
and too heavy in the rules.

81
00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:05.303
So it's a good on-ramp and introduction

82
00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:07.858
to the actual game, and role-playing games in general.

83
00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:09.702
So they put character roles, equipment,

84
00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:11.269
things are very easy to pick up.

85
00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.833
They've already put out some awesome books,

86
00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:13.666
if you've seen already,

87
00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:15.950
they have the Warriors and Weapons book,

88
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.388
there's the Monsters and Creatures book,

89
00:03:17.388 --> 00:03:20.069
and then coming up on November 26th,

90
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.002
Dungeons and Tombs. So slowly building that element there.

91
00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:27.314
Then March next year is the Wizards and Spells book,

92
00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:28.375
so looking forward to that, too.

93
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.295
But for those of you who are trying to

94
00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:30.953
get your kids to play with you,

95
00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:33.694
or have people that are like, "It's too complicated for me,"

96
00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:35.777
these are kind of your thing.

97
00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:37.053
They're actually really cute, the art's amazing,

98
00:03:37.053 --> 00:03:38.353
everyone who worked on it did a great job,

99
00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:40.845
so check it out if you haven't had the opportunity yet.

100
00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:41.678
You can find it at

101
00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:46.678
bit.ly/10Speed,

102
00:03:46.964 --> 00:03:50.411
and thank you guys so much for supporting our show tonight.

103
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:51.379
Let's see.

104
00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.189
Next up, Marisha, you've got some announcements.

105
00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.430
MARISHA: Oh man and oh man!

106
00:03:57.574 --> 00:03:58.407
Tomorrow.

107
00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:04.721
7:00pm.

108
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:07.054
(laughter)

109
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:10.171
Fucking UnDeadwood is back!

110
00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.799
TALIESIN: That was a load circle turning there for a second.

111
00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.782
MARISHA: The exciting conclusion

112
00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:20.115
of our four-part miniseries.

113
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.487
Watch it, please.

114
00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:25.545
(laughter)

115
00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:26.378
Please.

116
00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:30.236
Watch it live, because you're not going to want to

117
00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.859
have it spoiled, and I can't guarantee that,

118
00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:36.588
because shit is fucking crazy in this finale,

119
00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:40.383
so grab a loved one, sit on a couch,

120
00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:44.133
binge it tomorrow if you haven't, UnDeadwood.

121
00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:46.478
Tomorrow.

122
00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:48.738
(laughter)

123
00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:49.688
MATT: Thank you, Marisha.

124
00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:50.924
TRAVIS: We'll be watching live.

125
00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:52.196
MATT: Oh yeah.

126
00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:55.092
MARISHA: Oh yeah, sitting on Brian's couch.

127
00:04:55.092 --> 00:04:58.871
LAURA: Snuggled up in some Tal'Dorei blankets.

128
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.137
SAM: Nice merch drop.

129
00:05:01.137 --> 00:05:03.715
MATT: You're good at what you do.

130
00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.522
Travis, you have some things to chat about.

131
00:05:05.522 --> 00:05:07.453
TRAVIS: Yes, once again, for the month of November,

132
00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:09.945
we have partnered with OSD.

133
00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:11.532
(cheering)

134
00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:14.466
OSD, we've helped support our active and veteran

135
00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.520
military communities, and so far,

136
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.231
with our campaign in the month of November,

137
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:20.960
we have helped almost 400 veterans,

138
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.378
and we are on a mission to help even more,

139
00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:25.278
so thank you for you guys that have supported already.

140
00:05:25.278 --> 00:05:28.169
Please give if you can, if can't, share the message.

141
00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.231
Love our military community so much.

142
00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:31.648
It's so important that we give back to them

143
00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:33.700
for everything that they do for us.

144
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.533
We're doing it again,

145
00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:35.720
all the way through the month of November,

146
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.686
the link is critrole.com/OSD.

147
00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:42.827
the link is critrole.com/OSD.

148
00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:44.394
MARISHA: Nailed it!

149
00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:45.487
TRAVIS: Was that a backwards D?

150
00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:46.670
It's right, okay, good.

151
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.124
MATT: No, the D was right, the S was.

152
00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:51.052
(laughter)

153
00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:55.080
So (laughs) thank you, Travis.

154
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.232
Last up, next weekend, in Austin, Texas,

155
00:05:58.232 --> 00:05:59.699
we are having our live show,

156
00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.657
The Adventures of the Darrington Brigade.

157
00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:03.258
(cheering)

158
00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:05.508
For those who are attending, we'd like to remind you,

159
00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:07.269
we have a strict no-spoiler policy.

160
00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:08.110
So those who will be there,

161
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.209
please do not post spoilers online for the show,

162
00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:14.855
as you'll be the only ones to see it for a little bit.

163
00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:17.840
It'll be held at the Bass Concert Hall in Austin.

164
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.695
Super excited for it,

165
00:06:18.695 --> 00:06:20.895
and for everyone else who cannot be there,

166
00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.158
you can catch The Adventures of the Darrington Brigade

167
00:06:23.158 --> 00:06:26.418
on Friday, November 29th, at 7:00pm Pacific

168
00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:28.099
on our Twitch channel, and the VOD

169
00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.535
will be immediately available after for our subscribers,

170
00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:33.376
and will be on our YouTube channel the following Sunday.

171
00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:34.458
So you don't have to wait too long.

172
00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.379
SAM: Is that the day after Thanksgiving?

173
00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.702
So you can huddle around with your family,

174
00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:41.058
and eat leftovers and watch us be silly.

175
00:06:41.058 --> 00:06:43.535
LAURA: Snuggled up in some... Tal'Dorei blankets.

176
00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:46.095
(laughter)

177
00:06:46.095 --> 00:06:47.920
MATT: All right, Laura.

178
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.670
It is comfortable, but all right.

179
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.108
Yeah, I'm super excited, everyone's made their characters,

180
00:06:55.108 --> 00:06:57.480
and it's going to be interesting.

181
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.283
(laughs) Some fun stuff in this one.

182
00:07:01.283 --> 00:07:02.722
So yeah, check out all the information

183
00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.594
at critrole.com/events.

184
00:07:05.594 --> 00:07:08.452
I believe that concludes my announcements,

185
00:07:08.452 --> 00:07:10.843
and as such, I think it's time

186
00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:15.115
to bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

187
00:07:15.115 --> 00:07:17.741

(flames whooshing)

209
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:55.666
MATT: And welcome back.

210
00:08:55.666 --> 00:09:00.666
So last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

211
00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.128
through the help of some allies they've gathered

212
00:09:03.128 --> 00:09:05.784
from now different parts of Exandria.

213
00:09:05.784 --> 00:09:10.784
You uncovered the true form, the true identity,

214
00:09:11.132 --> 00:09:13.586
of the mysterious Angel of Iron's entity

215
00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.920
that this cult was based around.

216
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.723
And it turns out to be Tharizdun,

217
00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:20.556
the Chained Oblivion, no big deal.

218
00:09:22.743 --> 00:09:24.744
Uncertain if members of the cult are aware

219
00:09:24.744 --> 00:09:27.613
that they're worshiping, or are along with the secret,

220
00:09:27.613 --> 00:09:30.446
it's a very bad dude.

221
00:09:31.725 --> 00:09:34.879
So you began to gather information

222
00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:37.419
about this individual,

223
00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:40.526
and elements of Obann's possible plan.

224
00:09:40.526 --> 00:09:44.581
As part of this endeavor, you've made your way to Zadash,

225
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:47.284
back in the Empire, to ask for some aid,

226
00:09:47.284 --> 00:09:48.555
as you were sent to Oremid Hass,

227
00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:51.216
one of the members of the Cerberus Assembly,

228
00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:54.913
who has some sort of connection or old friendship

229
00:09:54.913 --> 00:09:58.927
with Yussa, and you have started the process

230
00:09:58.927 --> 00:10:01.679
of disseminating the information of the dangers

231
00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:04.790
that seem to be mounting around you.

232
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.125
After which, you made your way to the Invulnerable Vagrant

233
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:10.829
to check up the stock of items they have

234
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:14.995
and to just check in on good old Pumat Sol.

235
00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:17.345
After looking around at the wares, which were a bit thin,

236
00:10:17.345 --> 00:10:19.689
as it seems that him and his simulacrum

237
00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:22.498
have been focusing on producing items

238
00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:24.135
that have been commissioned for the war effort

239
00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:26.177
by the Cerberus Assembly.

240
00:10:26.177 --> 00:10:29.019
Partway into this conversation,

241
00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:33.840
Caduceus felt a sudden terrible

242
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.538
sharp pain in your back,

243
00:10:36.538 --> 00:10:37.681
all of you beginning to realize

244
00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:42.646
that a blade had penetrated him between the shoulder blades,

245
00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:44.858
and you watched as this entity,

246
00:10:44.858 --> 00:10:49.339
this dark elf female figure with reddish hair,

247
00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:52.443
pulled back back a little bit by a black bandana,

248
00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.532
swathed in cloak and leathers,

249
00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:57.182
seemed to be halfway emerging from the ground,

250
00:10:57.182 --> 00:11:01.645
semi-spectral, and had stabbed Caduceus,

251
00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:06.324
smiling, then vanished back into the floor, out of sight.

252
00:11:06.324 --> 00:11:08.374
And that's where we left off.

253
00:11:08.374 --> 00:11:12.138
So Mighty Nein, roll initiative.

254
00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.227
(laughter)

255
00:11:14.227 --> 00:11:16.269
MARISHA: Out the gate!

256
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:19.233
LIAM: You a bad enough dude to bring back the Betrayer Gods?

257
00:11:19.233 --> 00:11:21.917
MATT: (laughs)

258
00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:23.045
SAM: Bad dudes.

259
00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:25.795
LIAM: Average as fuck for Mr. Caleb Widogast.

260
00:11:27.157 --> 00:11:28.300
TALIESIN: AAF.

261
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.630
MATT: So starting at the top here,

262
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.210
we have 25 to 20.

263
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.548
SAM: 24!

264
00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:36.381
MARISHA: Yes!

265
00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:39.572
MATT: 20 to 15.

266
00:11:40.723 --> 00:11:41.556
MARISHA: 15.

267
00:11:42.473 --> 00:11:43.715
LIAM: Oh, wow.

268
00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:44.996
MARISHA: Yeah.

269
00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.066
MATT: All right.

270
00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:49.056
15 to 10.

271
00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:49.950
LAURA: 13.
TALIESIN: 12.

272
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.529
TRAVIS: 11.

273
00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:54.181
MATT: Okay, so we have Jester.

274
00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:56.681
TRAVIS: Nott-- or Caduceus and Caleb.

275
00:11:58.363 --> 00:12:00.013
MATT: You guys have had a couple of battles

276
00:12:00.013 --> 00:12:01.510
where you guys went at the same time.

277
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.383
Fjord, you have?

278
00:12:02.383 --> 00:12:04.084
TRAVIS: 11.
LIAM: That bit has ruined me,

279
00:12:04.084 --> 00:12:06.151
because my head is just going (like Rick) Woo-woo-woo!

280
00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:09.318
SAM: (stammering like Morty)

281
00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:11.658
MATT: All righty.

282
00:12:12.569 --> 00:12:13.585
LAURA: Is that all of us?

283
00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:15.310
MATT: So top of the round,

284
00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:18.663
you've just watched this creature,

285
00:12:18.663 --> 00:12:21.986
this assassin-type entity vanish into the floorboards

286
00:12:21.986 --> 00:12:23.389
underneath the Invulnerable Vagrant.

287
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:25.056
Everyone's staring in shock.

288
00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:26.445
It's your turn, what are you doing?

289
00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:28.609
SAM: (like Morty) (stammering) Where-- shit.

290
00:12:28.609 --> 00:12:31.242
(laughter)

291
00:12:31.242 --> 00:12:33.515
Turns out Morty and Nott are pretty close.

292
00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:36.184
(laughter)

293
00:12:36.184 --> 00:12:38.425
Where did they disappear down to?

294
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.933
MATT: Right behind Caduceus.

295
00:12:39.933 --> 00:12:41.525
SAM: Oh, shit!

296
00:12:43.524 --> 00:12:44.418
Where?

297
00:12:44.418 --> 00:12:46.296
MATT: Right behind Caduceus, right there.

298
00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:48.162
LIAM: (like Rick) Yeah, okay.

299
00:12:50.544 --> 00:12:52.297
SAM: Well, I have no shot.

300
00:12:52.297 --> 00:12:57.048
MATT: You have no shot, you have no eyes on the creature.

301
00:12:57.048 --> 00:12:58.484
MARISHA: Oh, she's gone.

302
00:12:58.484 --> 00:12:59.830
MATT: She sunk into the floor.

303
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.629
SAM: The Inevitable End, I assume,

304
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:05.487
can see up through the floor, I'm just guessing,

305
00:13:05.487 --> 00:13:07.154
so in order to hide,

306
00:13:08.717 --> 00:13:10.881
I'm going to go jump on that table.

307
00:13:10.881 --> 00:13:13.194
LAURA: That's what I was going to do, too!
MATT: You want to jump on which table?

308
00:13:13.194 --> 00:13:15.152
SAM: The one with the pillow.

309
00:13:15.152 --> 00:13:15.985
LAURA: The one in the middle?

310
00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:17.263
TRAVIS: Are you going to treat it like Tremors?

311
00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:19.225
MARISHA: Yeah, no one move.

312
00:13:19.225 --> 00:13:20.133
MATT: All righty.

313
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.508
So you leap up onto the table there.

314
00:13:21.508 --> 00:13:24.082
SAM: Bonus action, hide, get low.

315
00:13:24.082 --> 00:13:25.405
MATT: Can't hide in the middle of a table,

316
00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:26.310
it's elevated in the middle of the chamber.

317
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.045
SAM: But I'm hiding from the bottom.

318
00:13:28.045 --> 00:13:29.464
MATT: Oh, from the floor.

319
00:13:29.464 --> 00:13:31.406
SAM: So they can't see me.

320
00:13:31.406 --> 00:13:32.384
MATT: So you're underneath.

321
00:13:32.384 --> 00:13:34.247
SAM: No, I'm over it.

322
00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:38.546
Assuming that whoever is under the floor can see up.

323
00:13:38.546 --> 00:13:40.282
MATT: Okay.

324
00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:42.427
SAM: But not through the bottom of it.

325
00:13:42.427 --> 00:13:44.239
MATT: We'll see what it does.

326
00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:45.344
Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

327
00:13:45.344 --> 00:13:46.541
SAM: Okay.

328
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:50.590
With advantage, because of me, yeah, a million, like 30.

329
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.537
MATT: Your cloak blends into the actual coloration

330
00:13:52.537 --> 00:13:54.446
and pattern of the wood on the top.

331
00:13:54.446 --> 00:13:58.416
SAM: Then I will hold my action 'til I see an enemy.

332
00:13:58.416 --> 00:13:59.844
MATT: Okay, what action are you holding?

333
00:13:59.844 --> 00:14:02.430
SAM: Firing a crossbow-type device.

334
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.263
MATT: You got it.

335
00:14:03.263 --> 00:14:05.202
That finishes Nott's go.

336
00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:06.279
All right.

337
00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:07.482
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck, already?

338
00:14:07.482 --> 00:14:08.376
Come on, man!

339
00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:10.709
(shouting)

340
00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:15.657
I'm just writing "The End" for their turn.

341
00:14:15.657 --> 00:14:17.990
(laughter)

342
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.917
Creepy laugh. Which creepy laugh was that?

343
00:14:26.336 --> 00:14:30.307
MATT: As you all quietly look around as Nott jumps

344
00:14:30.307 --> 00:14:33.935
onto the table, gets low and begins to prepare.

345
00:14:33.935 --> 00:14:36.768
SAM: The table is the Inevitable End.

346
00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:39.378
LAURA: (yelling) No!

347
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.127
MATT: Swooping up from underneath,

348
00:14:41.127 --> 00:14:43.215
you see, rising into the air,

349
00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:47.191
and actually slightly floating about six or seven inches

350
00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:51.191
off the ground, takes two strikes at Beauregard.

351
00:14:52.407 --> 00:14:54.013
SAM: May I fire?

352
00:14:54.013 --> 00:14:54.846
MATT: You may.

353
00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:56.540
SAM: I'll take my shot.

354
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.373
LAURA: It's going to go straight through her.

355
00:14:57.373 --> 00:14:59.294
SAM: Ooh, not good.

356
00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:00.974
Not good.
LAURA: That was balls, dude.

357
00:15:00.974 --> 00:15:02.037
SAM: 15.

358
00:15:02.037 --> 00:15:02.955
MATT: 15 misses.

359
00:15:02.955 --> 00:15:04.900
SAM: Yeah, for sure, it does.

360
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.986
MATT: It actually goes
(whooshes, arrow twanging) into the table,

361
00:15:06.986 --> 00:15:08.529
and everyone at this point who's been looking around,

362
00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:10.314
and hears the sound of you fire the crossbow,

363
00:15:10.314 --> 00:15:13.114
glance over, and you see emerge,

364
00:15:13.114 --> 00:15:15.982
and both blades going towards Beauregard.

365
00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:17.757
The first attack against you.

366
00:15:17.757 --> 00:15:19.385
MARISHA: Wait, what?

367
00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:20.720
MATT: 28 to hit.

368
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.157
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: 28 to hit.

369
00:15:22.157 --> 00:15:24.152
TRAVIS: 28.
MATT: Correct.

370
00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:26.777
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Barely misses.

371
00:15:26.777 --> 00:15:31.543
MATT: And the second attack is going to be 20.

372
00:15:31.543 --> 00:15:32.564
MARISHA: 20's my AC.

373
00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:33.866
MATT: So yeah, they both hit.

374
00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:34.997
Okay.

375
00:15:34.997 --> 00:15:38.423
So that being the case, you take--

376
00:15:38.423 --> 00:15:41.692
TRAVIS: We didn't figure out
what class we think they are, right?

377
00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:42.908
MARISHA: She's fucking backstabbing people.

378
00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:46.347
MATT: 10 points of slashing damage from the blade,

379
00:15:46.347 --> 00:15:49.315
and then sneak attack, because you did not know

380
00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:51.949
where she was coming from from underneath.

381
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:53.218
It's going to be--

382
00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:54.638
TRAVIS: That's bad.

383
00:15:54.638 --> 00:15:55.919
MATT: Oh, it's fine, what are you talking about?

384
00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:57.644
SAM: Don't monks get, like--

385
00:15:57.644 --> 00:15:59.377
they can't be surprised or something?

386
00:15:59.377 --> 00:16:01.602
I don't know, I'm just making this up.

387
00:16:01.602 --> 00:16:03.038
MARISHA: No. (laughs)

388
00:16:03.038 --> 00:16:06.436
TRAVIS: I hear a lot of dice.

389
00:16:06.436 --> 00:16:08.766
SAM: Can you take that feat?

390
00:16:08.766 --> 00:16:11.266
MARISHA: I could, the Observant feat.

391
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:14.003
MATT: Additional 34 points of piercing damage.

392
00:16:14.003 --> 00:16:15.398
MARISHA: How much?
MATT: 34.

393
00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:17.488
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: In addition to the 10?

394
00:16:17.488 --> 00:16:18.321
MATT: Correct.

395
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:20.423
MARISHA: So that's 44 damage.
MATT: 44 points of piercing damage.

396
00:16:20.423 --> 00:16:23.921
And I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

397
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:26.366
LAURA: It's poison daggers.

398
00:16:26.366 --> 00:16:28.091
SAM: That was their first attack?
MATT: Correct.

399
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:28.994
SAM: Ooh!

400
00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:31.574
MARISHA: Although, I don't, no I do.

401
00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.991
LAURA: That was one dagger did 40?

402
00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:36.475
SAM: Oh my god, it's Vax.

403
00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:38.362
Vax is attacking us.

404
00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:39.374
MARISHA: What was it?

405
00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.568
Poison?
MATT: Poison, yeah.

406
00:16:40.568 --> 00:16:42.602
MARISHA: I'm immune to poison.

407
00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:44.127
MATT: That's right.
SAM: All poison.

408
00:16:44.127 --> 00:16:47.086
MARISHA: Because of monk shit.
SAM: There you go.

409
00:16:47.086 --> 00:16:51.815
MATT: The second attack does 11 points of piercing damage.

410
00:16:51.815 --> 00:16:53.285
TALIESIN: Oh god.

411
00:16:53.285 --> 00:16:56.848
MATT: But you are immune to poison, so no effect.

412
00:16:56.848 --> 00:17:00.144
As the two strikes (whooshes) into you, you feel the pain,

413
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:02.288
you turn around to defend yourself.

414
00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:03.247
You can see from the wounds

415
00:17:03.247 --> 00:17:07.057
this dark liquid beyond your own blood

416
00:17:07.057 --> 00:17:08.525
spilling across the wound,

417
00:17:08.525 --> 00:17:09.834
and you can sense it would've been poison,

418
00:17:09.834 --> 00:17:11.365
but your body rejects it entirely,

419
00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:15.090
and you can see this assassin

420
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:17.223
(growls) grimace look,

421
00:17:17.223 --> 00:17:18.807
and is going to go ahead and try and slip

422
00:17:18.807 --> 00:17:20.763
back under the floor.
LAURA: Sentinel!

423
00:17:20.763 --> 00:17:21.596
MARISHA: Exactly.

424
00:17:21.596 --> 00:17:23.478
MATT: You do, all right, go ahead and make an attack.

425
00:17:23.478 --> 00:17:26.766
TRAVIS: Are you poisoned, Caduceus?
TALIESIN: No.

426
00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:29.016
I got decent--
TRAVIS: Grave cleric shit?

427
00:17:30.022 --> 00:17:31.590
MARISHA: No, 15.

428
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.423
MATT: 15.

429
00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:37.466
Slips back into the floor.
TRAVIS: What the fuck!

430
00:17:37.466 --> 00:17:38.299
Coward!

431
00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:41.136
(laughter)

432
00:17:41.136 --> 00:17:44.900
MATT: Finishing their turn, Beauregard, you're up.

433
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.733
MARISHA: Ow!

434
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.375
Fuck!

435
00:17:50.523 --> 00:17:52.246
I'm going to--

436
00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:54.071
SAM: Hit the floor.

437
00:17:54.071 --> 00:17:57.921
MARISHA: I kind of, actually--
I'm going to stagger to the middle.

438
00:17:57.921 --> 00:17:58.754
MATT: Okay.

439
00:17:58.754 --> 00:18:00.628
MARISHA: I'm three-point landing this shit,

440
00:18:00.628 --> 00:18:04.798
they crouch down into a low crow thing,

441
00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:07.696
and take Patient Defense.

442
00:18:07.696 --> 00:18:08.529
MATT: Okay.

443
00:18:08.529 --> 00:18:11.224
MARISHA: And that's my bonus action, can I hold my attack

444
00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:12.794
for if I see her?

445
00:18:12.794 --> 00:18:15.081
MATT: See her within range?

446
00:18:15.081 --> 00:18:15.916
Yeah.

447
00:18:15.916 --> 00:18:18.236
If you have any daggers or things you want to throw,

448
00:18:18.236 --> 00:18:19.972
you can do that.

449
00:18:22.793 --> 00:18:24.375
It's up to you.

450
00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:26.708
And Jester, you are on deck.

451
00:18:31.308 --> 00:18:33.206
MARISHA: Actually, yeah, I'm going to stay right here,

452
00:18:33.206 --> 00:18:35.636
because I'm in this awesome cross section

453
00:18:35.636 --> 00:18:38.198
where I'm between everybody.

454
00:18:38.198 --> 00:18:39.281
MATT: You got it.

455
00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:42.743
Okay, and you're holding your physical or ranged attack?

456
00:18:42.743 --> 00:18:43.832
You can hold attack and you can choose

457
00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.951
at the moment, actually, that's fine.

458
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:46.784
I'll allow that.

459
00:18:46.784 --> 00:18:49.819
All right, Jester, what's your dexterity, by the way?

460
00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:51.069
LAURA: My dexterity?

461
00:18:52.189 --> 00:18:54.126
Saving or just regular?

462
00:18:54.126 --> 00:18:55.201
18?

463
00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:56.850
Plus four.

464
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.201
MATT: Oh, your dexterity's really high,

465
00:18:58.201 --> 00:19:00.701
so yeah, you go. Go ahead.

466
00:19:01.873 --> 00:19:03.092
LAURA: Oh.

467
00:19:03.092 --> 00:19:07.342
Okay, I'm going to jump up on the table next to me,

468
00:19:09.885 --> 00:19:12.230
and backing my back against the wall,

469
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.426
not next to the window.

470
00:19:14.426 --> 00:19:18.187
I'm going to, as an action, I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

471
00:19:18.187 --> 00:19:19.478
MATT: All righty.

472
00:19:19.478 --> 00:19:20.864
LAURA: I'm going to make my duplicate appear

473
00:19:20.864 --> 00:19:23.248
directly next to me, and then I'm going to have her

474
00:19:23.248 --> 00:19:26.643
hop down off the table, and run across the room

475
00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:28.663
and jump up on the table across the room,

476
00:19:28.663 --> 00:19:31.613
and put her back to the wall over there.

477
00:19:31.613 --> 00:19:32.716
MATT: You got it.

478
00:19:32.716 --> 00:19:34.716
LAURA: And as my free action.

479
00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:38.385
SAM: Free action?

480
00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:41.315
LAURA: Can I kick the shield that's at my feet

481
00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:43.804
and bring it up and use it?

482
00:19:43.804 --> 00:19:45.384
MATT: Sure, do you have a shield already?

483
00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:46.393
LAURA: I have a shield.

484
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:47.469
SAM: Like a skateboard kick?

485
00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:49.077
LAURA: Yeah, a skateboard kick.

486
00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:51.850
MATT: Let me double check and see if it requires attunement.

487
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.844
I don't know if it does, because if not, it's pretty rare.

488
00:19:54.844 --> 00:19:56.581
MARISHA: Wait, is this the fancy shield,

489
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:59.234
that you're like-- oh, hell yeah.

490
00:19:59.234 --> 00:20:00.447
You're fighting and stealing?

491
00:20:00.447 --> 00:20:01.917
MATT: It does not require attunement.

492
00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:05.252
LAURA: Fuck yeah, skateboard kick it up, grab onto it.

493
00:20:05.252 --> 00:20:06.838
SAM: Kick flip!
MATT: All right, so,

494
00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.118
your armor class is considered one higher

495
00:20:08.118 --> 00:20:09.423
for the duration of this encounter,

496
00:20:09.423 --> 00:20:10.648
as long as you hold that shield.

497
00:20:10.648 --> 00:20:11.648
LAURA: All right.

498
00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:13.618
MATT: For that base, I'm going to go ahead

499
00:20:13.618 --> 00:20:15.319
and pull the shield off the battlefield.

500
00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.558
LAURA: Woo!

501
00:20:16.558 --> 00:20:18.304
SAM: Nicely shielded!
LAURA: Thank you.

502
00:20:18.304 --> 00:20:19.890
TALIESIN: Way to go!

503
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.125
MATT: All righty.

504
00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:24.188
So Jester, is that the end of your turn?

505
00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:25.023
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: All right,

506
00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:26.832
it's the Pumats' turn.

507
00:20:26.832 --> 00:20:27.923
TRAVIS: The Pumats' turn!?

508
00:20:27.923 --> 00:20:30.550
SAM: Ooh, they get to fight!

509
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.393
MATT: So Pumat, who sees this happening,

510
00:20:33.393 --> 00:20:34.581
first, he sees Caduceus making that face,

511
00:20:34.581 --> 00:20:37.442
and go, "Oh, what, are you hungry?"

512
00:20:37.442 --> 00:20:39.946
Then sees the whole assault, going,

513
00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:42.637
"Oh no, this is real bad.

514
00:20:42.637 --> 00:20:44.143
"Pumats, upstairs!"

515
00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:47.156
This Pumat goes ahead and runs this way,

516
00:20:47.156 --> 00:20:48.197
is going to go ahead and double dash

517
00:20:48.197 --> 00:20:51.354
and head back up in the stairway out of the way.

518
00:20:51.354 --> 00:20:53.797
SAM: Watch all the Pumats be blood hunters or something.

519
00:20:53.797 --> 00:20:56.311
(laughter)

520
00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:58.479
SAM: They start slicing their arms.

521
00:20:58.479 --> 00:21:01.572
MATT: After Pumat Prime sees that one run off

522
00:21:01.572 --> 00:21:03.638
and ensure the other two aren't down here,

523
00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:06.040
looks back and sees all of you getting up on tables,

524
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.983
and goes, "Well, I ain't one to miss a clue here,"

525
00:21:09.983 --> 00:21:14.849
gets up on the counter, and is going to go ahead and...

526
00:21:18.385 --> 00:21:19.776
This'll be interesting.

527
00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:21.055
TALIESIN: I love it when you say that.

528
00:21:21.055 --> 00:21:22.973
MATT: He's going to go ahead and--

529
00:21:22.973 --> 00:21:24.569
the people who look the most hurt right now

530
00:21:24.569 --> 00:21:27.234
are Beauregard and Nott.

531
00:21:27.234 --> 00:21:28.067
Sorry, Caduceus, right?

532
00:21:28.067 --> 00:21:28.900
TALIESIN: Yes.

533
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.050
MATT: He's going to cast Greater Invisibility.

534
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:33.883
SAM: Ooh!

535
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:38.560
MATT: Has the ability called Split Enchantment,

536
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.269
cast an enchantment spell, first level or higher.

537
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:42.208
Actually, no, I don't know if it's an enchantment,

538
00:21:42.208 --> 00:21:43.285
that's an illusion, shit.

539
00:21:43.285 --> 00:21:44.785
I don't know if I can do that.

540
00:21:44.785 --> 00:21:46.266
SAM: Split Enchantment?

541
00:21:46.266 --> 00:21:47.669
TRAVIS: Where you can like split the targets.

542
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:49.228
MATT: Yeah, no, that's not an enchantment spell.

543
00:21:49.228 --> 00:21:50.960
That's my bad.

544
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.235
Instead...

545
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.205
TALIESIN: Know everything about D&amp;D!

546
00:21:55.205 --> 00:21:57.138
MATT: I know.
LAURA: (laughs)

547
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:00.944
MATT: No, we'll still go ahead and cast Greater Invisibility

548
00:22:00.944 --> 00:22:02.016
on you, because you're the one

549
00:22:02.016 --> 00:22:03.640
who seems to need it the most.

550
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.999
TALIESIN: Does that mean I can't do anything

551
00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:07.863
without dropping Invisibility?

552
00:22:07.863 --> 00:22:09.140
MATT: Greater Invisibility means you can use anything

553
00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.745
you want to, you can cast spells, whatever.

554
00:22:10.745 --> 00:22:11.787
LAURA: What!

555
00:22:11.787 --> 00:22:14.744
SAM: But someone just bought them, right?

556
00:22:14.744 --> 00:22:17.530
LIAM: Did we buy them in here? That's true. I'm out of them.

557
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.144
SAM: Who bought the potion, who has all those potions?

558
00:22:20.144 --> 00:22:21.921
LAURA: I think we bought them as a group.

559
00:22:21.921 --> 00:22:23.568
MATT: You did, but somebody's holding them.

560
00:22:23.568 --> 00:22:25.212
SAM: That's four to Caduceus.

561
00:22:25.212 --> 00:22:26.124
LAURA: It would've been four to Caduceus,

562
00:22:26.124 --> 00:22:28.043
because you were at the table, yeah.

563
00:22:28.043 --> 00:22:29.310
MATT: All right, and then Pumat's going to move up

564
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.270
against the wall as well,

565
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.520
so everybody else can stay right there.

566
00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:35.414
All righty.

567
00:22:36.344 --> 00:22:39.076
So you are, for the time being, invisible.

568
00:22:39.076 --> 00:22:40.393
TALIESIN: Cool.

569
00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:41.810
MATT: That's going to finish Pumat's turn.

570
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.801
That brings us to Caduceus and Caleb,

571
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:46.693
you guys can choose between the two of you.

572
00:22:46.693 --> 00:22:49.659
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up

573
00:22:51.768 --> 00:22:53.622
into the stairs.

574
00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:54.985
MATT: Okay, like onto the stairs?
TALIESIN: Yeah,

575
00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:56.106
I think onto the stairs.

576
00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:56.939
MATT: Like right around there?

577
00:22:56.939 --> 00:22:59.444
TALIESIN: Yeah, probably like halfway up, just to be--

578
00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:02.799
MATT: Okay, I'll say for the purposes of that.

579
00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:05.064
TALIESIN: And I'm holding a spell.

580
00:23:05.064 --> 00:23:05.897
MATT: Okay, what spell are you holding?

581
00:23:05.897 --> 00:23:06.749
TALIESIN: I'm holding Bane.

582
00:23:06.749 --> 00:23:08.587
MATT: Bane, okay, got it.

583
00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:10.964
We'll consider this to be you halfway up the steps.

584
00:23:10.964 --> 00:23:14.025
All right, Caleb, what are you doing?

585
00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:15.741
LIAM: Caleb was examining a brass lantern

586
00:23:15.741 --> 00:23:17.355
when all this happened, and he turned and saw,

587
00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:20.086
(whooshing) people disappeared,

588
00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:21.849
so the brass lantern goes to the floor,

589
00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:25.136
and Caleb just goes (whooshes), and is also invisible.

590
00:23:25.136 --> 00:23:26.775
MATT: All righty.

591
00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:30.403
LIAM: And will woodenly climb up onto the table

592
00:23:30.403 --> 00:23:32.236
that he's in front of.

593
00:23:33.226 --> 00:23:36.001
LAURA: I like that all of us are just like, I don't know.

594
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:37.710
SAM: It's a rat. There's a rat lost.

595
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.091
(laughter)

596
00:23:39.091 --> 00:23:41.368
MATT: Okay, that's you for the time being.

597
00:23:41.368 --> 00:23:42.612
That'll work.

598
00:23:42.612 --> 00:23:43.529
All righty.

599
00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:47.462
So that finishes your turn.

600
00:23:47.462 --> 00:23:50.221
Then that brings us to Fjord.

601
00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:55.221
TRAVIS: Yes, I will also hop up on the bar in front of me,

602
00:23:55.372 --> 00:23:58.002
and I will turn to face the main floor,

603
00:23:58.002 --> 00:24:00.398
and I will hold Eldritch Blast

604
00:24:00.398 --> 00:24:03.522
whenever we see invisi-fuck.

605
00:24:03.522 --> 00:24:04.428
MATT: You got it.

606
00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:05.776
All right, top of the round.

607
00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:07.168
Nott.

608
00:24:07.168 --> 00:24:09.876
SAM: But they're not here.
MATT: It's eerie and quiet,

609
00:24:09.876 --> 00:24:11.468
everyone's in position,

610
00:24:11.468 --> 00:24:13.060
and there's just this tension in the air,

611
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.300
not quite sure where they're going to pop up.

612
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.850
SAM: Good god!

613
00:24:19.794 --> 00:24:23.396
I will, bonus action, well, I can't really hide,

614
00:24:23.396 --> 00:24:25.729
because they know where I am.

615
00:24:26.723 --> 00:24:29.350
Unless I scramble and go somewhere else.

616
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.222
I'm going to scramble across to the bookshelf

617
00:24:31.222 --> 00:24:33.493
and hide on the third shelf up.

618
00:24:33.493 --> 00:24:34.326
MATT: Over here?
SAM: Yeah.

619
00:24:34.326 --> 00:24:36.659
(laughter)

620
00:24:38.848 --> 00:24:40.307
LIAM: Shrinks in.

621
00:24:40.307 --> 00:24:41.506
MATT: I'll allow it.

622
00:24:41.506 --> 00:24:42.422
Being a goblin.

623
00:24:42.422 --> 00:24:46.422
SAM: I'm going to ready my Bola shot,

624
00:24:46.422 --> 00:24:49.116
my trappy...

625
00:24:49.116 --> 00:24:51.117
Yeah, and ready it.

626
00:24:51.117 --> 00:24:52.057
MATT: All right, so, roll your stealth check for your hide.

627
00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:54.205
LIAM: Hiding a gremlin on a toy shelf.

628
00:24:54.205 --> 00:24:56.364
SAM: Stealth was not great, 15.

629
00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:57.947
MATT: 15, got it, okay.

630
00:24:59.173 --> 00:25:00.453
Next up.

631
00:25:00.453 --> 00:25:01.286
SAM: 16.

632
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.632
MATT: A figure emerges here under the floor.

633
00:25:07.632 --> 00:25:08.804
SAM: I fire!

634
00:25:08.804 --> 00:25:11.836
TALIESIN: Actually, I bet Bane, I would
be first, so, Bane first.

635
00:25:11.836 --> 00:25:12.669
MATT: Correct.

636
00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:14.908
So Bane, what is the saving throw on that?

637
00:25:14.908 --> 00:25:16.086
TALIESIN: 17 charisma.

638
00:25:16.086 --> 00:25:19.364
MATT: 17 charisma, fail.

639
00:25:19.364 --> 00:25:21.525
ALL: Yeah!

640
00:25:21.525 --> 00:25:24.271
SAM: Bane makes her weaker.

641
00:25:24.271 --> 00:25:27.864
TALIESIN: Saves, Bane means that--

642
00:25:27.864 --> 00:25:29.376
MATT: Saves and attacks are minus the d4.

643
00:25:29.376 --> 00:25:30.659
TALIESIN: Yeah.

644
00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:33.147
Saving throw and attack rolls.

645
00:25:33.147 --> 00:25:35.010
SAM: Oh, Jesus!

646
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:35.843
TALIESIN: Okay.

647
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.156
All right.

648
00:25:38.156 --> 00:25:39.485
MATT: All right, that goes off,

649
00:25:39.485 --> 00:25:40.741
and then now Nott, you can take your attack,

650
00:25:40.741 --> 00:25:43.910
and you can take your Eldritch Blast.

651
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.630
MARISHA: And my throwing dart.

652
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.366
MATT: All right.

653
00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:48.601
LIAM: And my axe.

654
00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:50.551
(laughter)

655
00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:52.718
TRAVIS: That one totally misses.

656
00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:55.880
MATT: Wait for Fjord to finish.

657
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.983
SAM: Oh, if only that was something better than a dart.

658
00:25:59.983 --> 00:26:01.243
TRAVIS: 17.

659
00:26:01.243 --> 00:26:02.614
MATT: What is it?

660
00:26:02.614 --> 00:26:03.909
17?

661
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:05.533
TRAVIS: Is it 17?

662
00:26:05.533 --> 00:26:06.950
Damn it.
SAM: Darts.

663
00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:09.366
TRAVIS: 19.

664
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.273
MATT: 19 hits.

665
00:26:12.273 --> 00:26:13.832
TALIESIN: 19 hits, good to know.

666
00:26:13.832 --> 00:26:14.999
TRAVIS: That's good.

667
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.114
11 points of force damage.

668
00:26:20.114 --> 00:26:21.830
MATT: Okay.

669
00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:28.109
So you fired the Eldritch Blast (whooshes),

670
00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:30.426
and it strikes, or seems to strike,

671
00:26:30.426 --> 00:26:32.211
but right where it hits and impacts,

672
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:35.278
the image fades, and now you can see

673
00:26:35.278 --> 00:26:38.085
the figure has actually been to the right of it,

674
00:26:38.085 --> 00:26:40.198
and there's now two other illusory versions

675
00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:41.558
floating around it.

676
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:43.305
TALIESIN: This is your fault. I'm blaming you,

677
00:26:43.305 --> 00:26:44.417
I'm blaming all this on you.

678
00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:46.704
LIAM: Blur. I got that one.

679
00:26:46.704 --> 00:26:48.328
MATT: So now there are two images of it

680
00:26:48.328 --> 00:26:50.171
that are shifting in and out of its space,

681
00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:51.492
now that that is triggered.

682
00:26:51.492 --> 00:26:52.361
SAM: So I have to pick one to shoot at?

683
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:53.971
MATT: Roll your second attack.

684
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:55.227
TRAVIS: That was the second.
MATT: Oh, that was?

685
00:26:55.227 --> 00:26:56.060
Gotcha.

686
00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:56.972
All right, now you go.

687
00:26:56.972 --> 00:26:57.805
MARISHA: Natural 20.

688
00:26:57.805 --> 00:26:59.318
MATT: Awesome!

689
00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:02.561
MATT: So and darts are just d4, right?

690
00:27:02.561 --> 00:27:03.890
I forgot the debate about this,

691
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.570
and I always fucking forget.

692
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.336
MATT: Right, technically it's dagger.

693
00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:08.953
I mean, I'm okay with letting it be considered

694
00:27:08.953 --> 00:27:10.820
a martial weapon, because you made it to be that way,

695
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.986
but we're considering it,

696
00:27:11.986 --> 00:27:14.761
you're making it to be a monk weapon. That's fine.

697
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:15.982
I'll say that any time that's happened,

698
00:27:15.982 --> 00:27:18.468
you've adjusted, so go for it.

699
00:27:18.468 --> 00:27:19.853
MARISHA: So that's a D6, right?

700
00:27:19.853 --> 00:27:24.103
MATT: It's whatever your martial arts score is, though.

701
00:27:25.419 --> 00:27:26.752
MARISHA: Cool, roll it.

702
00:27:28.082 --> 00:27:28.915
LAURA: Oh.

703
00:27:30.363 --> 00:27:32.196
MARISHA: It's always the one.

704
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:36.868
Double that crit to two

705
00:27:36.868 --> 00:27:39.901
for an awesome total of eight.

706
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:43.648
LAURA: Hey man, that's eight points that she didn't--

707
00:27:43.648 --> 00:27:47.281
MATT: ♪ Eight points of damage ♪

708
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:50.677
(whooshes) It hits, but you can see the armor

709
00:27:50.677 --> 00:27:53.124
takes most of the brunt of it,

710
00:27:53.124 --> 00:27:55.617
and as soon as it impacts, she reaches down

711
00:27:55.617 --> 00:27:57.838
and grabs it and throws it onto the floor.

712
00:27:57.838 --> 00:27:59.053
Looks back at you angrily.

713
00:27:59.053 --> 00:28:00.466
MARISHA: Awesome, I'll pick that up later.

714
00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:02.066
TALIESIN: Actually, it doesn't look back at her angrily,

715
00:28:02.066 --> 00:28:04.342
because she's not there.

716
00:28:04.342 --> 00:28:05.919
LAURA: What, Beau is here.
MARISHA: I'm not invisible.

717
00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:06.816
TALIESIN: Oh, you're not invisible?

718
00:28:06.816 --> 00:28:07.996
MATT: No, he wasn't able to do both.

719
00:28:07.996 --> 00:28:10.390
It was an illusion, it wasn't enchantment.

720
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.711
I was going to try that, but then I remembered

721
00:28:11.711 --> 00:28:13.397
it was illusion, not enchantment.

722
00:28:13.397 --> 00:28:15.373
That's my bad.

723
00:28:15.373 --> 00:28:16.737
MARISHA: 21.

724
00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:17.570
MATT: 21?

725
00:28:18.827 --> 00:28:19.660
Yeah.

726
00:28:21.027 --> 00:28:23.506
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, wow.

727
00:28:23.506 --> 00:28:24.756
Where were you?

728
00:28:25.853 --> 00:28:27.081
12.

729
00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:27.914
MATT: 12 points of damage.

730
00:28:27.914 --> 00:28:31.011
MARISHA: No six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

731
00:28:31.011 --> 00:28:32.192
MATT: 10 points damage, all right.

732
00:28:32.192 --> 00:28:37.192
So (whooshes) both darts end up piercing into the assassin,

733
00:28:37.523 --> 00:28:39.690
now looking about.

734
00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:42.287
Now they're going to take their turn.

735
00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:43.834
SAM: I was still going to shoot my Bola.

736
00:28:43.834 --> 00:28:46.550
MATT: That's right, yeah, shoot your Bola.

737
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.518
SAM: Eight plus, I don't know, is this a called shot

738
00:28:49.518 --> 00:28:52.571
or something weird, or is it just a normal attack?

739
00:28:52.571 --> 00:28:55.171
It's not going to hit, it's plus 10.

740
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:57.099
MATT: So a total of 18 does not hit.

741
00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:59.210
SAM: Bane, anything Bane, no Bane?

742
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.648
MATT: It doesn't affect armor class, unfortunately.

743
00:29:01.648 --> 00:29:03.391
So after being hit with the daggers,

744
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:05.491
hears the tink sound, the head turns

745
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:06.765
and twitches real fast over the shoulder,

746
00:29:06.765 --> 00:29:07.758
and (whooshes) ducks out of the way

747
00:29:07.758 --> 00:29:09.893
as the bola goes scattering into the wall,

748
00:29:09.893 --> 00:29:11.128
almost hitting you, Jester,

749
00:29:11.128 --> 00:29:13.686
and knocks a bunch of shit off the tables.

750
00:29:13.686 --> 00:29:15.996
SAM: Sorry! Sorry.

751
00:29:15.996 --> 00:29:18.061
MATT: So now, they're going to take their turn,

752
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:22.728
and you watch as goes ahead and pulls up,

753
00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:27.046
begins to, let's see here.

754
00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:28.817
It's going to go ahead and begin casting

755
00:29:28.817 --> 00:29:32.057
some sort of a spell, muttering under their breath,

756
00:29:32.057 --> 00:29:33.489
and you watch as in a--

757
00:29:33.489 --> 00:29:35.172
LIAM: Counterspell.

758
00:29:35.172 --> 00:29:37.074
MATT: Counterspell, all righty.

759
00:29:37.074 --> 00:29:38.419
That counters it, nevermind.

760
00:29:38.419 --> 00:29:40.082
LAURA: Yes!

761
00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:41.869
SAM: But you are no longer invisible.

762
00:29:41.869 --> 00:29:43.548
LIAM: Yes, I am. Greater Invisibility.

763
00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:45.212
MATT: You are regular Invisibility, you are now visible.

764
00:29:45.212 --> 00:29:46.487
SAM: You did Greater?

765
00:29:46.487 --> 00:29:48.019
TRAVIS: You are now visible, he said.

766
00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:48.909
LAURA: But he did Greater.

767
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:49.742
MATT: You did Greater as opposed to regular?

768
00:29:49.742 --> 00:29:50.784
Then yeah, then you're fine.

769
00:29:50.784 --> 00:29:52.175
SAM: Greater!

770
00:29:53.445 --> 00:29:55.591
MATT: Great, so (whooshes) the spell finishes,

771
00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:58.400
but you see the head turns over,

772
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.852
after hearing the sound, and while you're invisible,

773
00:30:00.852 --> 00:30:02.782
it vaguely knows where you are.

774
00:30:02.782 --> 00:30:03.615
LAURA: (German accent) Counterspell.

775
00:30:03.615 --> 00:30:06.575
MATT: Going to go ahead and do that.

776
00:30:06.575 --> 00:30:07.554
TALIESIN: No, you don't!

777
00:30:07.554 --> 00:30:08.436
Put it out!

778
00:30:08.436 --> 00:30:10.252
LIAM: <i>Und</i> I said, "Biiiii--"

779
00:30:10.252 --> 00:30:12.995
(laughter)

780
00:30:12.995 --> 00:30:15.341
MATT: It's just going to go ahead and vanish back.

781
00:30:15.341 --> 00:30:16.174
LAURA: No!

782
00:30:18.418 --> 00:30:20.384
SAM: That's the worst.

783
00:30:20.384 --> 00:30:22.182
LAURA: Hate when they vanish.

784
00:30:22.182 --> 00:30:24.545
MATT: Could've been worse.

785
00:30:24.545 --> 00:30:27.309
Could've not Counterspelled.

786
00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:29.010
It was Faerie Fire, it wasn't a big deal.

787
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.743
(laughs)

788
00:30:30.743 --> 00:30:32.495
TALIESIN: Well, I mean. You know.

789
00:30:32.495 --> 00:30:36.534
MARISHA: Faerie Fire is awesome.
MATT: It's pretty legit.

790
00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:39.482
So anyway, finishing that, Beauregard, you're up,

791
00:30:39.482 --> 00:30:41.399
Jester, you're on deck.

792
00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:48.175
MARISHA: Assassin stuff.

793
00:30:49.923 --> 00:30:52.043
Got to crack my knuckles together,

794
00:30:52.043 --> 00:30:55.635
light up the lightning gloves.

795
00:30:56.718 --> 00:30:58.561
MATT: The bolts now crackle across your forearm,

796
00:30:58.561 --> 00:30:59.993
you can feel that tingly sensation

797
00:30:59.993 --> 00:31:02.611
as the electrical energy can surge back and forth

798
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.329
across your arms, and they go a little numb

799
00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:06.234
from the vibration.

800
00:31:06.234 --> 00:31:07.649
What are you doing?

801
00:31:07.649 --> 00:31:10.274
MARISHA: What would I do if I were her?

802
00:31:11.998 --> 00:31:12.831
Okay.

803
00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:18.089
Shit, where would she go?

804
00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:22.065
I'm going to go and get near Jester

805
00:31:22.065 --> 00:31:23.974
and guard her, because if it were me,

806
00:31:23.974 --> 00:31:25.646
I'd kill the cleric.

807
00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:29.718
TRAVIS: Oh, that's so dark.
MARISHA: That's true.

808
00:31:29.718 --> 00:31:30.640
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn--

809
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.209
MARISHA: And hold my attack.

810
00:31:32.209 --> 00:31:33.809
MATT: Okay, you got it.

811
00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:36.825
Jester, you're up.
LAURA: Okay, for my action,

812
00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:38.158
I'm going to use my--

813
00:31:39.869 --> 00:31:40.761
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

814
00:31:40.761 --> 00:31:43.865
LAURA: -- my Rod of the Solitary Scout,

815
00:31:43.865 --> 00:31:46.718
and I'm going to cast Grease on the floor.

816
00:31:46.718 --> 00:31:49.138
MATT: Okay. What's the radius of that?

817
00:31:49.138 --> 00:31:50.371
LAURA: It's 10 foot.

818
00:31:50.371 --> 00:31:52.603
MATT: Where do you want it to go?

819
00:31:52.603 --> 00:31:55.682
LAURA: I'm going to guess that
she's going to appear around here

820
00:31:55.682 --> 00:31:59.698
next time, to get the floor, or both,

821
00:31:59.698 --> 00:32:02.016
I'm going to do right here.

822
00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:04.328
Then for my bonus action,

823
00:32:04.328 --> 00:32:08.659
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

824
00:32:08.659 --> 00:32:10.561
MATT: Awesome.

825
00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:11.521
At what level?

826
00:32:11.521 --> 00:32:15.538
LAURA: At fourth level,

827
00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:18.283
so that I get 4d8 attacks.

828
00:32:18.283 --> 00:32:19.971
So it's a serrated lollipop.

829
00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:21.755
MATT: 2d8, you mean, right?

830
00:32:21.755 --> 00:32:24.164
Because every two levels, the damage dice goes up.

831
00:32:24.164 --> 00:32:26.100
LAURA: Right, I was looking at Spiritual Guardians.

832
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.050
MATT: That's okay.

833
00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.250
All right, so where would you like it to go?

834
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.386
LAURA: Ooh, that's a good one, too.

835
00:32:29.386 --> 00:32:32.175
Maybe I should've done that.

836
00:32:32.175 --> 00:32:35.169
I'm going to cast Spiritual Guardians instead!

837
00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:37.489
Oh nevermind, that's not a bonus, that's why I was doing it.

838
00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:39.239
Spiritual Weapon!

839
00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:41.202
MATT: All right, where would you like it to go?

840
00:32:41.202 --> 00:32:42.309
LAURA: Something with spirits.

841
00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:46.726
It's going to be right next to--

842
00:32:48.892 --> 00:32:49.725
TRAVIS: In between you and Caleb?

843
00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:51.551
LAURA: Yeah, in between me and Caleb.

844
00:32:51.551 --> 00:32:53.242
MATT: You got it.

845
00:32:53.242 --> 00:32:54.075
Okay.

846
00:32:56.232 --> 00:32:58.533
That finishes your turn then.

847
00:32:58.533 --> 00:33:00.533
LAURA: I'm going to put it here.

848
00:33:01.832 --> 00:33:02.832
MATT: All right.

849
00:33:03.727 --> 00:33:05.961
You're good there?

850
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:07.262
LAURA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Okay.

851
00:33:07.262 --> 00:33:08.605
Brings it to Pumat's turn.

852
00:33:08.605 --> 00:33:10.447
Pumat's going to go ahead and maintain Greater Invisibility

853
00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:12.840
on you.
TALIESIN: Thank you!

854
00:33:15.997 --> 00:33:17.664
MATT: And is going to--

855
00:33:24.935 --> 00:33:25.873
Actually, Pumat's not going to do that.

856
00:33:25.873 --> 00:33:27.953
Pumat feels that you're probably at least got out

857
00:33:27.953 --> 00:33:31.918
of the moment of danger, and can be more useful elsewhere.

858
00:33:31.918 --> 00:33:34.668
So Pumat is instead going to go,

859
00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:39.597
"Wherever you are, hope you're safe!

860
00:33:39.597 --> 00:33:43.036
"You two seem to be pretty helpful.

861
00:33:43.036 --> 00:33:44.694
"Sorry if it's a little cramped. (grunts)"

862
00:33:44.694 --> 00:33:48.221
And uses Split Enchantment to cast Enlarge

863
00:33:48.221 --> 00:33:50.420
on both Beauregard and Fjord.

864
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.162
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, let's go!

865
00:33:53.162 --> 00:33:55.610
LIAM: Bring out the big minis!

866
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:56.443
TRAVIS: Whoa!

867
00:33:58.613 --> 00:34:00.483
SAM: That's a Fjord 350, F-350.

868
00:34:00.483 --> 00:34:01.316
LAURA: What?

869
00:34:02.712 --> 00:34:04.885
TRAVIS: Now that's what I call a super duty.

870
00:34:04.885 --> 00:34:07.486
LAURA: Be aware of the grease on the floor, you guys.

871
00:34:07.486 --> 00:34:08.811
LIAM: Let them fight.

872
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:10.316
MATT: Probably be about there, just outside of the grease.

873
00:34:10.316 --> 00:34:13.066
TRAVIS: (glissando)

874
00:34:13.066 --> 00:34:14.566
MARISHA: This is awesome!

875
00:34:16.002 --> 00:34:16.927
MATT: You're maintaining concentration

876
00:34:16.927 --> 00:34:19.362
on your Invisibility.

877
00:34:19.362 --> 00:34:21.976
TALIESIN: And I'm maintaining concentration on the--

878
00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.179
MATT: Correct, but you're no longer--

879
00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.302
TALIESIN: I'm no longer, I'm about to be invisible again,

880
00:34:25.302 --> 00:34:29.246
but I'm no longer invisible.
TRAVIS: An extra d4, I think, to your hits?

881
00:34:29.246 --> 00:34:31.512
MARISHA: Yes.
TRAVIS: Okay.

882
00:34:31.512 --> 00:34:34.081
MATT: With that, he's going to stay up against the wall,

883
00:34:34.081 --> 00:34:37.596
because "Seems to be working out all right so far."

884
00:34:37.596 --> 00:34:39.513
That finishes his turn.

885
00:34:40.455 --> 00:34:42.955
Caleb and Caduceus, pardon me.

886
00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:49.139
TALIESIN: I'm going-- well, you go first.

887
00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.592
LIAM: Well, I saw this--

888
00:34:51.592 --> 00:34:52.801
MATT: Aw. Man.

889
00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:54.301
LIAM: Hmm?
SAM: He can't do that either?

890
00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:55.134
MATT: It's Transmutation,

891
00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:56.759
I thought it was Enchantment.
SAM: Goddamn it!

892
00:34:56.759 --> 00:34:58.052
MATT: This is lame.

893
00:34:58.052 --> 00:35:00.373
(laughter)

894
00:35:00.373 --> 00:35:01.412
It's my own fault.

895
00:35:01.412 --> 00:35:04.256
SAM: Can't you just say you have Split Transmutation, too?

896
00:35:04.256 --> 00:35:06.641
I mean, he's Pumat, he can do whatever.

897
00:35:06.641 --> 00:35:08.974
TRAVIS: Give it to the monk.

898
00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:10.068
MATT: No, I'll give it to you, because you're the closest.

899
00:35:10.068 --> 00:35:12.068
TRAVIS: Take it to the bridge!

900
00:35:13.189 --> 00:35:16.145
MATT: Plus, we haven't seen the thing yet.
LIAM: Seen the big Fjord yet.

901
00:35:16.145 --> 00:35:17.361
LAURA: That would've been real cool, though.

902
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:19.439
MATT: That would've been, that's on me.

903
00:35:19.439 --> 00:35:21.924
I'm not used to playing an Enchanter.

904
00:35:21.924 --> 00:35:23.341
That's a new one.

905
00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:26.958
LIAM: So I saw the Inevitable End

906
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.484
stare right in my general direction,

907
00:35:28.484 --> 00:35:29.676
and then she sunk into the floor,

908
00:35:29.676 --> 00:35:32.338
so I will carefully get down onto the floor

909
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:34.103
and go to the table in the center of the room

910
00:35:34.103 --> 00:35:37.686
and change my position, and wait, and hold.

911
00:35:39.328 --> 00:35:41.757
I will cast a spell the moment I see her.

912
00:35:41.757 --> 00:35:43.701
Do you need to know the spell?

913
00:35:43.701 --> 00:35:44.794
MATT: Yes, because you're holding.
LIAM: Okay.

914
00:35:44.794 --> 00:35:46.010
We'll make it Magic Missile.

915
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.510
MATT: All right, you got it, okay.

916
00:35:49.553 --> 00:35:52.020
TALIESIN: I'll hold Path to the Grave.

917
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.344
I'm actually going to cast Invisibility on myself,

918
00:35:55.344 --> 00:35:56.507
which I can do as a bonus action.

919
00:35:56.507 --> 00:35:57.757
MATT: Yes, you can.

920
00:35:59.085 --> 00:36:01.585
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to shift.

921
00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:07.037
I'm going to shift down and just on top of the bar there,

922
00:36:07.037 --> 00:36:09.683
like right there, just so I'm no longer in the same place,

923
00:36:09.683 --> 00:36:12.735
and I'm going to hold Sentinel at Death's--

924
00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:17.642
I'm going to hold, where'd it go?

925
00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:21.423
Path to the Grave for right before Caleb.

926
00:36:21.423 --> 00:36:23.006
MATT: You got it, okay.

927
00:36:24.636 --> 00:36:26.417
That finishes your turn.
TALIESIN: Yep.

928
00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:27.799
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

929
00:36:27.799 --> 00:36:30.935
TRAVIS: (inhales) Okay.

930
00:36:30.935 --> 00:36:32.714
This is new, wonderful.

931
00:36:32.714 --> 00:36:36.465
MATT: The ceiling here is about 15 feet off the ground,

932
00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:40.447
like 12 to 15 feet, and you're now almost hitting.

933
00:36:40.447 --> 00:36:41.769
There's a chandelier in the middle,

934
00:36:41.769 --> 00:36:42.833
it's about eye-level, and you're like,

935
00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:44.818
oh, this is really strange.

936
00:36:44.818 --> 00:36:47.422
TRAVIS: Will it be disadvantage on a melee attack

937
00:36:47.422 --> 00:36:51.288
with my sword, if I swing it this cramped?

938
00:36:51.288 --> 00:36:52.305
MATT: No, it's not that cramped.

939
00:36:52.305 --> 00:36:53.293
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

940
00:36:53.293 --> 00:36:55.263
MATT: You just don't have a lot of vertical movement.

941
00:36:55.263 --> 00:36:59.343
TRAVIS: Great, I'll summon the sword (whooshes).

942
00:36:59.343 --> 00:37:01.541
LIAM: So it's like it's you, Travis, in a room.

943
00:37:01.541 --> 00:37:02.817
MATT: Yeah, basically.

944
00:37:02.817 --> 00:37:05.934
TRAVIS: Anywhere in Europe or Asia, yeah.

945
00:37:06.806 --> 00:37:09.619
Boy, that was terrible.

946
00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:12.107
I will use the command word <i>Galas-var</i>,

947
00:37:12.107 --> 00:37:14.493
and make all the runes glow on the sword,

948
00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:16.572
and I will hold--
MATT: The room now lights up around him.

949
00:37:16.572 --> 00:37:19.013
TRAVIS: I'll hold a melee attack until

950
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.592
the Inevitable End appears around me.

951
00:37:24.592 --> 00:37:26.756
MATT: Okay, you got it.
MARISHA: Looking good, Captain.

952
00:37:26.756 --> 00:37:28.280
MATT: Nott, you're up.

953
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.647
SAM: I'm just going to say, we're sitting ducks in here.

954
00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:33.855
Should we develop some sort of strategy?

955
00:37:33.855 --> 00:37:34.963
It's fine.

956
00:37:36.009 --> 00:37:37.592
TALIESIN: This is strategy.

957
00:37:38.938 --> 00:37:41.539
SAM: I don't know that Caleb's already occupying it,

958
00:37:41.539 --> 00:37:44.326
so I'm going to move to that middle table as well,

959
00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:47.759
just to keep Lady Luck guessing here.

960
00:37:49.198 --> 00:37:51.314
MATT: Push you over on the floor.

961
00:37:51.314 --> 00:37:54.708
SAM: What was that, that you just knocked off?

962
00:37:54.708 --> 00:37:57.440
LIAM: Crown on a pillow.
MATT: It's flair.

963
00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.312
SAM: Whatever it is, I'm going to bonus action steal it.

964
00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:02.155
MATT: Okay.

965
00:38:02.155 --> 00:38:03.743
(laughter)

966
00:38:03.743 --> 00:38:06.829
SAM: And then prepare a spell this time.

967
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:08.288
MATT: Do you want to make a sleight of hand check?

968
00:38:08.288 --> 00:38:09.195
SAM: Sure.

969
00:38:09.195 --> 00:38:10.832
MATT: Can you do that as a bonus action, your cunning
action?

970
00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:12.697
SAM: I don't know, I have no idea.

971
00:38:12.697 --> 00:38:13.530
If not, forget it.

972
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.280
LIAM: Cunning action is dodge, disengage and hide.

973
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.113
MATT: Correct.

974
00:38:16.986 --> 00:38:18.045
LIAM: Would be your action.

975
00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:19.992
SAM: Then nevermind.

976
00:38:19.992 --> 00:38:23.128
I will just hide up there and prepare a spell.

977
00:38:23.128 --> 00:38:24.966
MATT: What spell are you preparing?

978
00:38:24.966 --> 00:38:26.595
SAM: Hideous Laughter.

979
00:38:26.595 --> 00:38:28.829
MATT: You got it. All righty.

980
00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:30.970
Finishing your turn.

981
00:38:38.483 --> 00:38:42.225
Emerging up through the floor, right here.

982
00:38:42.225 --> 00:38:44.628
LAURA: Aww.
SAM: Oh shit.

983
00:38:44.628 --> 00:38:47.543
MATT: As if the footsteps across the floorboards

984
00:38:47.543 --> 00:38:49.876
were a giveaway of movement,

985
00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:53.226
it's going to rise out.

986
00:38:53.226 --> 00:38:55.674
LIAM: (spell whooshes)
TALIESIN: Yep.

987
00:38:55.674 --> 00:38:57.511
MATT: So you guys go.

988
00:38:57.511 --> 00:38:59.752
SAM: Release all the spells.

989
00:38:59.752 --> 00:39:00.752
Simul-spell.

990
00:39:01.623 --> 00:39:02.972
Who goes first?

991
00:39:02.972 --> 00:39:05.097
TALIESIN: I do, but it's just

992
00:39:05.097 --> 00:39:06.600
Channel Divinity, Path to the Grave.

993
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.549
MATT: I'm trying to think.

994
00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:13.369
Technically, they're hidden from you,

995
00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:15.524
so I think they might get their attack first,

996
00:39:15.524 --> 00:39:17.238
and then you get the reaction.

997
00:39:17.238 --> 00:39:19.425
Because you don't notice where they're coming from

998
00:39:19.425 --> 00:39:20.608
until they arrive.

999
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:22.197
SAM: Okay.

1000
00:39:22.197 --> 00:39:24.084
MATT: I'm just trying to think here.
LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense.

1001
00:39:24.084 --> 00:39:27.094
MATT: Because they're hiding and stealthing as well,

1002
00:39:27.094 --> 00:39:29.495
and popping up and trying to surprise each of you.

1003
00:39:29.495 --> 00:39:31.207
So I'll let you do that, going forward

1004
00:39:31.207 --> 00:39:32.948
in this instance, after the attack.

1005
00:39:32.948 --> 00:39:33.781
SAM: That's fine.

1006
00:39:33.781 --> 00:39:36.318
MATT: So it's going to be one attack,

1007
00:39:36.318 --> 00:39:37.923
both attacks at you, Nott, actually.

1008
00:39:37.923 --> 00:39:39.537
Because you are not immediately visible,

1009
00:39:39.537 --> 00:39:41.585
though they were drawn to the table,

1010
00:39:41.585 --> 00:39:44.199
you're who they see on top.

1011
00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:48.449
TALIESIN: With the d4, if I remember.
MATT: Correct.

1012
00:39:49.569 --> 00:39:53.428
That is going to be (laughs) 17.

1013
00:39:53.428 --> 00:39:54.678
SAM: Miss!

1014
00:39:56.426 --> 00:39:57.707
MATT: Second attack.

1015
00:39:57.707 --> 00:39:59.139
SAM: I use that item to block it.

1016
00:39:59.139 --> 00:40:01.381
MATT: Natural 20.
SAM: Okay, okay.

1017
00:40:02.295 --> 00:40:06.223
TALIESIN: As a reaction, I'm canceling the natural 20.

1018
00:40:06.223 --> 00:40:07.331
MATT: What's the distance on that one?

1019
00:40:07.331 --> 00:40:08.780
TALIESIN: 30 feet.

1020
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.040
Double-checking, 30 feet.

1021
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.621
MATT: 30 feet, yeah, you can do that.

1022
00:40:12.621 --> 00:40:15.608
TRAVIS: Grave cleric!
MARISHA: Caddy!

1023
00:40:15.608 --> 00:40:17.791
LAURA: You would have been dead.
SAM: Bad.

1024
00:40:17.791 --> 00:40:19.059
LAURA: You'd have been instantly dead.

1025
00:40:19.059 --> 00:40:19.892
SAM: Yeah!

1026
00:40:20.733 --> 00:40:21.837
But I got friends.

1027
00:40:21.837 --> 00:40:23.756
MATT: So the first one misses, the second one does hit you.

1028
00:40:23.756 --> 00:40:26.522
TRAVIS: ♪ I've got friends in low places ♪

1029
00:40:26.522 --> 00:40:27.788
MARISHA: My brain went there too!

1030
00:40:29.097 --> 00:40:31.097
♪ Where the whiskey drowns ♪

1031
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.258
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ And the beer chases my blues away ♪

1032
00:40:36.258 --> 00:40:37.760
SAM: I can't tell who's singing right now.

1033
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.687
TRAVIS: ♪ And I'll be okay ♪

1034
00:40:41.687 --> 00:40:43.517
MATT: With the weapon attack in there,

1035
00:40:43.517 --> 00:40:48.476
that is 51 points of piercing damage.

1036
00:40:48.476 --> 00:40:49.634
LIAM: Dag nabbit.

1037
00:40:49.634 --> 00:40:51.559
SAM: Of what damage?
MATT: Piercing damage.

1038
00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:53.980
SAM: I will Uncanny Dodge that.

1039
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.137
Does that use my reaction?
MATT: It uses your reaction.

1040
00:40:56.137 --> 00:40:58.246
SAM: Which I need to cast the spell.

1041
00:40:58.246 --> 00:40:59.870
MATT: Correct.

1042
00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.509
SAM: But I've already committed to casting the spell,

1043
00:41:01.509 --> 00:41:03.614
so no Uncanny Dodge, 51.

1044
00:41:03.614 --> 00:41:04.900
MATT: 51 points of damage.

1045
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.887
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

1046
00:41:06.887 --> 00:41:07.720
SAM: Okay.

1047
00:41:09.565 --> 00:41:10.398
Mm-hmm.

1048
00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:12.623
17?

1049
00:41:12.623 --> 00:41:15.093
MATT: You lose the spell.

1050
00:41:15.093 --> 00:41:17.226
It breaks your concentration as you're focusing on it

1051
00:41:17.226 --> 00:41:19.559
from the impact of the blow.

1052
00:41:20.549 --> 00:41:21.978
TRAVIS: But not poisoned?

1053
00:41:21.978 --> 00:41:23.501
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving throw now

1054
00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:26.053
against the poison in the blade.

1055
00:41:26.053 --> 00:41:27.064
SAM: 19.

1056
00:41:27.064 --> 00:41:29.113
MATT: 19, yeah, you managed to resist it.

1057
00:41:29.113 --> 00:41:31.221
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

1058
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:33.772
I hate this table!

1059
00:41:33.772 --> 00:41:35.238
MATT: All right, now you guys can take your actions,

1060
00:41:35.238 --> 00:41:38.177
except for Nott, who, the impact is so painful

1061
00:41:38.177 --> 00:41:41.440
that the spell just fitters out of your fingers.

1062
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.577
MARISHA: Pop-pop with my lightning gloves!

1063
00:41:43.577 --> 00:41:44.774
TALIESIN: You're first, yeah.

1064
00:41:44.774 --> 00:41:45.919
LIAM: So his hands just light up,

1065
00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:50.204
and five little pink dots spiral out like homing missiles,

1066
00:41:50.204 --> 00:41:51.501
and go (impacts) and hit.

1067
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:53.506
MATT: Immediately (impacts).

1068
00:41:53.506 --> 00:41:57.376
(laughs) Point-blank range, like a shotgun.

1069
00:41:57.376 --> 00:41:58.209
20 points.

1070
00:41:58.209 --> 00:42:00.105
TALIESIN: And they have vulnerability to it.

1071
00:42:00.105 --> 00:42:01.003
MATT: They have vulnerability to--

1072
00:42:01.003 --> 00:42:03.187
TALIESIN: To the Magic Missile.

1073
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.020
MATT: From?

1074
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.579
TALIESIN: From my Path to the Grave.

1075
00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:07.522
MATT: THat you were holding--

1076
00:42:07.522 --> 00:42:09.615
TALIESIN: Oh, I lost my fucking Path to the Grave,

1077
00:42:09.615 --> 00:42:11.330
because I was holding it, and I used that.

1078
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.465
MATT: Which means you wouldn't have the reaction,

1079
00:42:12.465 --> 00:42:13.964
which means that was a critical hit.

1080
00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:16.086
TALIESIN: No, I would've used, I would've lost it.

1081
00:42:16.086 --> 00:42:18.499
MATT: You used your reaction to maintain the spell.

1082
00:42:18.499 --> 00:42:19.559
TALIESIN: Oh, shit!

1083
00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:21.230
MATT: So I'm sorry, taking that back.

1084
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.202
It was 51, I said?

1085
00:42:23.202 --> 00:42:25.452
TALIESIN: Wait, let me double-check.

1086
00:42:27.464 --> 00:42:30.472
MATT: 51 minus nine,

1087
00:42:30.472 --> 00:42:34.534
so that would be 42,

1088
00:42:34.534 --> 00:42:38.367
84 plus nine, 90,

1089
00:42:39.218 --> 00:42:42.075
93 points of piercing damage.

1090
00:42:42.075 --> 00:42:43.628
LAURA: So you're zero.

1091
00:42:43.628 --> 00:42:46.328
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're zeroed out.
MATT: What's your hit-point max?

1092
00:42:46.328 --> 00:42:49.437
SAM: 81, I am unconscious.

1093
00:42:49.437 --> 00:42:50.838
MATT: No, you are not.

1094
00:42:50.838 --> 00:42:51.755
SAM: I'm dead?

1095
00:42:52.978 --> 00:42:56.228
MATT: I'm going to double-check the rule here.

1096
00:42:57.463 --> 00:42:58.316
When it comes to taking damage.

1097
00:42:58.316 --> 00:43:01.810
MARISHA: Assassins!
TALIESIN: Wait, did you go that far down?

1098
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.304
MATT: "Massive damage can kill you instantly.

1099
00:43:03.304 --> 00:43:04.803
"When damage reduces you to zero hit points,

1100
00:43:04.803 --> 00:43:05.701
"and there is damage remaining."

1101
00:43:05.701 --> 00:43:07.031
Oh, it's damage remaining.

1102
00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:08.463
Sorry, not total amount.

1103
00:43:08.463 --> 00:43:10.486
I misremembered that.

1104
00:43:10.486 --> 00:43:11.745
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good.

1105
00:43:11.745 --> 00:43:14.485
That means you would've had to be at zero hit points

1106
00:43:14.485 --> 00:43:16.660
for that, you would've had to be low.

1107
00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.602
MATT: I misremembered that rule.

1108
00:43:17.602 --> 00:43:19.462
So you're fine; you are unconscious.

1109
00:43:19.462 --> 00:43:23.298
SAM: Okay, I'm fine. I'm unconscious.
TRAVIS: What is the thing that you just read?

1110
00:43:23.298 --> 00:43:24.971
MATT: Oh, if you're unconscious,

1111
00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:28.300
and the extra damage goes over your maximum hit points,

1112
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.429
it's instantly death.

1113
00:43:29.429 --> 00:43:32.455
I misremembered that.

1114
00:43:32.455 --> 00:43:34.082
Fucking up rules left and right tonight.

1115
00:43:34.082 --> 00:43:35.165
My apologies.

1116
00:43:36.107 --> 00:43:37.449
But you are unconscious.

1117
00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:38.994
MARISHA: Wow.

1118
00:43:38.994 --> 00:43:40.121
SAM: Ugh!

1119
00:43:40.121 --> 00:43:41.889
LAURA: (laughs) (high-pitched) Ugh!

1120
00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:43.613
Wait, do it as Morty.

1121
00:43:43.613 --> 00:43:44.493
SAM: (as Morty) Ugh!

1122
00:43:44.493 --> 00:43:46.831
(laughter)

1123
00:43:46.831 --> 00:43:49.074
TALIESIN: So it's still double damage on the
Magic Missiles, then?

1124
00:43:49.074 --> 00:43:50.313
MATT: It is.

1125
00:43:50.313 --> 00:43:51.563
LIAM: So 40 total.

1126
00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.373
Or double damage on the dice.

1127
00:43:53.373 --> 00:43:55.214
SAM: Oh, he's checking again!

1128
00:43:55.214 --> 00:43:56.412
MATT: It gets weird when you hold actions,

1129
00:43:56.412 --> 00:43:58.579
so I'm checking one thing.

1130
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.148
So, ready.

1131
00:44:04.148 --> 00:44:06.231
"When you ready something--"

1132
00:44:09.134 --> 00:44:12.142
LIAM: Real D&amp;D right here, rules and everything.

1133
00:44:12.142 --> 00:44:14.134
SAM: We're losing against one person.

1134
00:44:14.134 --> 00:44:15.913
LAURA: Yeah, this is terrifying.

1135
00:44:15.913 --> 00:44:17.328
TRAVIS: I thought they might not be here for us,

1136
00:44:17.328 --> 00:44:18.888
but I think think they are.

1137
00:44:18.888 --> 00:44:19.783
TALIESIN: Interesting?

1138
00:44:19.783 --> 00:44:22.142
MATT: "When the trigger occurs, you can either take a
reaction

1139
00:44:22.142 --> 00:44:25.449
"right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger."

1140
00:44:25.449 --> 00:44:28.449
But the trigger hadn't happened yet.

1141
00:44:30.848 --> 00:44:32.532
"First, you decide...your reaction,

1142
00:44:32.532 --> 00:44:34.092
"when you choose the action, take the response.

1143
00:44:34.092 --> 00:44:36.259
(mumbled reading)

1144
00:44:38.456 --> 00:44:40.301
LAURA: You just tell us what <i>you</i> think, Matt.

1145
00:44:40.301 --> 00:44:41.833
LIAM: Just call it like a boss.

1146
00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:43.782
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: F the internet.

1147
00:44:43.782 --> 00:44:45.053
MATT: It's getting a little messy here.

1148
00:44:45.053 --> 00:44:48.245
I'm working with some interesting dynamics in this one.

1149
00:44:48.245 --> 00:44:49.988
So if you're holding something,

1150
00:44:49.988 --> 00:44:52.436
it uses your reaction to release it.

1151
00:44:52.436 --> 00:44:55.769
So if you want to change it up, which--

1152
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.969
TALIESIN: We're already going here now.

1153
00:44:58.969 --> 00:45:00.821
SAM: We already said we're releasing spells.

1154
00:45:00.821 --> 00:45:01.946
MATT: But going forward now--

1155
00:45:01.946 --> 00:45:03.462
TALIESIN: If I want to drop my
reaction for a different reaction.

1156
00:45:03.462 --> 00:45:04.295
MATT: For something else, you can do that,

1157
00:45:04.295 --> 00:45:05.436
but you lose the spell

1158
00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:08.174
that you're holding, so we're fine now.

1159
00:45:08.174 --> 00:45:09.257
LAURA: Okay, cool.

1160
00:45:10.393 --> 00:45:12.200
MATT: So the vulnerability does go through.

1161
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.522
TALIESIN: The vulnerability goes through.

1162
00:45:13.522 --> 00:45:16.445
MATT: And that is the 40 points of--

1163
00:45:16.445 --> 00:45:18.739
LIAM: Is just the dice double though, or whole thing?

1164
00:45:18.739 --> 00:45:21.544
MATT: Whole thing is double.
LIAM: Okay so, 40 total.

1165
00:45:21.544 --> 00:45:23.761
(laughter)

1166
00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:25.147
MATT: I know, it's a lot of struggling here.

1167
00:45:25.147 --> 00:45:26.957
Look at your ability. Is the vulnerability against anything,

1168
00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:28.790
or does it say attack?

1169
00:45:29.655 --> 00:45:32.229
SAM: Props to Taliesin's hair tonight, everyone.

1170
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:33.456
TALIESIN: Fresh hair.
LAURA: It's a good color.

1171
00:45:33.456 --> 00:45:35.718
MATT: If I recall, your ability is for attacks only,

1172
00:45:35.718 --> 00:45:38.063
I don't think it's effective on spells.

1173
00:45:38.063 --> 00:45:39.463
TALIESIN: "The next time you or an ally of yours

1174
00:45:39.463 --> 00:45:41.255
"hits the creature with an attack."

1175
00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:43.131
MATT: Correct, so it is 20 damage.

1176
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:44.728
TALIESIN: Oh, so next attack.

1177
00:45:44.728 --> 00:45:47.161
MATT: Is doubled, so keep that in mind.

1178
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:50.069
Okay, it's been a busy week,

1179
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:51.139
we're getting back in the swing of things,

1180
00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:52.204
right into combat.

1181
00:45:52.204 --> 00:45:53.297
I'm trying, it's a lot of layering.

1182
00:45:53.297 --> 00:45:55.734
TRAVIS: Holy shit. You're not even looking at their sheets,

1183
00:45:55.734 --> 00:45:56.796
that's impressive.
MATT: So now you.

1184
00:45:56.796 --> 00:45:58.671
TRAVIS: Huh?
MATT: You said you were making your--

1185
00:45:58.671 --> 00:46:00.225
TRAVIS: Oh, I was holding a melee attack.

1186
00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:01.156
MATT: That's right.

1187
00:46:01.156 --> 00:46:02.022
So no good on that one.

1188
00:46:02.022 --> 00:46:05.360
MARISHA: I'm holding punches, and I got reach!

1189
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.280
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1190
00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.863
So the first hit will be doubled on damage.

1191
00:46:08.863 --> 00:46:11.172
LAURA: Roll a crit, roll 20, crit it!

1192
00:46:11.172 --> 00:46:14.145
TRAVIS: The Enlarge doesn't increase my melee range to 15?

1193
00:46:14.145 --> 00:46:16.825
MATT: No, but you do an additional d4 per melee hit.

1194
00:46:16.825 --> 00:46:17.877
SAM: Yeah, you do.
LAURA: 20!

1195
00:46:17.877 --> 00:46:21.636
LIAM: Come on, keep the streak alive!
MARISHA: So I anime punch her in the face.

1196
00:46:21.636 --> 00:46:23.214
MARISHA: 19?

1197
00:46:23.214 --> 00:46:24.096
MATT: 19 hits.

1198
00:46:24.096 --> 00:46:25.700
LAURA: Woo!

1199
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.439
MATT: They are going to use their reaction to parry,

1200
00:46:27.439 --> 00:46:29.991
and add five to their AC. It misses.

1201
00:46:29.991 --> 00:46:32.716
TRAVIS: Fighter/rogue combo.

1202
00:46:32.716 --> 00:46:35.620
MARISHA: Do I not get-- is it the next one that does damage,

1203
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.730
or the next attack?

1204
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.104
MATT: The next that hits.

1205
00:46:40.104 --> 00:46:41.854
MARISHA: Okay, so here I go.

1206
00:46:44.026 --> 00:46:46.723
It's technically a reach attack.

1207
00:46:46.723 --> 00:46:48.335
MATT: Yeah, it's still technically a melee attack.

1208
00:46:48.335 --> 00:46:51.309
It's like (whooshes), causes it to ground itself.

1209
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:52.706
What is it?
MARISHA: 18.

1210
00:46:52.706 --> 00:46:54.821
MATT: 18 just misses, no hit.

1211
00:46:54.821 --> 00:46:56.321
MARISHA: Her AC's 19.

1212
00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:58.866
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Fuck.

1213
00:46:58.866 --> 00:47:01.966
LIAM: Let The Mighty Nein live.

1214
00:47:01.966 --> 00:47:03.866
LAURA: No, stay, I need you!

1215
00:47:03.866 --> 00:47:07.116
MATT: Then they vanish into the ground.

1216
00:47:08.067 --> 00:47:10.133
Taking their imagery with them.

1217
00:47:10.133 --> 00:47:11.050
All righty.

1218
00:47:11.975 --> 00:47:15.294
After vanishing, Beauregard, you're up.

1219
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:21.046
MARISHA: Okay.

1220
00:47:21.046 --> 00:47:23.367
I really want to--

1221
00:47:23.367 --> 00:47:25.784
I am going to...

1222
00:47:30.722 --> 00:47:32.826
go around this grease pit,

1223
00:47:32.826 --> 00:47:37.292
kind of over here,

1224
00:47:37.292 --> 00:47:38.525
but as I go,

1225
00:47:38.525 --> 00:47:41.425
I'm going to go, (feet stomping)

1226
00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:45.126
I'm walking over here!

1227
00:47:45.126 --> 00:47:46.932
SAM: Oh, you're drawing.
LAURA: You're stomping.

1228
00:47:46.932 --> 00:47:48.294
MATT: All right, over to Fjord?

1229
00:47:48.294 --> 00:47:51.878
MARISHA: Yeah, give me a little bit of room.

1230
00:47:51.878 --> 00:47:54.954
Yeah, so I'm not right up in his face.

1231
00:47:54.954 --> 00:47:58.445
Then I'm going to hold my melee attacks.

1232
00:47:58.445 --> 00:47:59.868
MATT: You got it, all right, Beau's turn's done.

1233
00:47:59.868 --> 00:48:01.349
Jester.

1234
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:06.293
LAURA: Jester is going to to tell her duplicate, mentally,

1235
00:48:06.293 --> 00:48:09.772
to jump off the table, and come over,

1236
00:48:09.772 --> 00:48:11.927
and run right here.

1237
00:48:11.927 --> 00:48:13.266
MATT: Right there?

1238
00:48:13.266 --> 00:48:16.014
LAURA: On the grease.

1239
00:48:16.014 --> 00:48:17.800
MARISHA: Patient Defense, I fucked up,

1240
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.264
I forgot it again, Patient Defense.

1241
00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.712
MATT: Patient defense, yeah, you can do it.

1242
00:48:21.712 --> 00:48:23.347
MARISHA: Bonus action, sorry, keep going.

1243
00:48:23.347 --> 00:48:28.190
LAURA: Then as an action, the duplicate is going to cast

1244
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:30.468
Spiritual Guardians so that the guardians

1245
00:48:30.468 --> 00:48:32.250
go around the duplicate.
MATT: Okay.

1246
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:34.016
What's the radius on that one?

1247
00:48:34.016 --> 00:48:38.682
LAURA: That is a radius of 15 feet,

1248
00:48:39.774 --> 00:48:42.223
all around her.

1249
00:48:42.223 --> 00:48:46.559
MARISHA: ♪ Are familiar faces ♪

1250
00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:48.059
LAURA: At 4th-level.

1251
00:48:49.595 --> 00:48:51.218
MATT: So keep that in mind there.

1252
00:48:51.218 --> 00:48:53.605
LAURA: And any time that they enter it.

1253
00:48:53.605 --> 00:48:55.166
MATT: They take damage, as a roll, take damage.

1254
00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:56.775
Yeah, got it, okay.

1255
00:48:56.775 --> 00:49:00.555
You are now focusing on maintaining

1256
00:49:00.555 --> 00:49:02.388
concentration on that.

1257
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.227
All right.

1258
00:49:05.227 --> 00:49:06.544
That finishes your go, Jester?

1259
00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:07.377
LAURA: Yes.

1260
00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:08.286
MATT: Pumat's turn.

1261
00:49:08.286 --> 00:49:10.333
Pumat is going to--

1262
00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:13.050
MARISHA: (giggling)

1263
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.405
MATT: What?

1264
00:49:14.405 --> 00:49:15.894
LIAM: (southern drawl) Now, for Pumat's turn.

1265
00:49:15.894 --> 00:49:19.195
(laughter)

1266
00:49:19.195 --> 00:49:21.502
LIAM: This is so much fun!
MATT: I know.

1267
00:49:21.502 --> 00:49:23.928
I'm running on little sleep today.

1268
00:49:23.928 --> 00:49:24.969
Here we go, we're going to go ahead,

1269
00:49:24.969 --> 00:49:27.484
and Pumat's actually going to start focusing on a spell

1270
00:49:27.484 --> 00:49:29.527
and holding it, looking a little nervous,

1271
00:49:29.527 --> 00:49:32.360
like, "Wherever you're coming from,

1272
00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:36.611
"just keeping my eyes peeled."

1273
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:39.751
That's going to be the end of his turn.

1274
00:49:39.751 --> 00:49:41.882
Caduceus and Caleb, what are you doing?

1275
00:49:41.882 --> 00:49:43.681
TALIESIN: You first, I'm still figuring my shit out.

1276
00:49:43.681 --> 00:49:44.514
LIAM: Shit.

1277
00:49:47.435 --> 00:49:48.706
I don't like this, but I'm going to do it.

1278
00:49:48.706 --> 00:49:50.943
I am going to cross over

1279
00:49:50.943 --> 00:49:55.193
and carefully climb up next to Jester on her table.

1280
00:49:58.216 --> 00:50:01.633
And I am going to do nothing.

1281
00:50:03.869 --> 00:50:05.550
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's it.

1282
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.669
MATT: Caduceus.

1283
00:50:06.669 --> 00:50:08.835
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Prayer-- not Prayer of Healing,

1284
00:50:08.835 --> 00:50:10.428
where'd I go?

1285
00:50:10.428 --> 00:50:11.511
Healing Word.

1286
00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:18.161
For my action, I'm going to,

1287
00:50:18.161 --> 00:50:19.344
since I'm about to become visible,

1288
00:50:19.344 --> 00:50:21.941
I'm going to make myself look like a Pumat.

1289
00:50:21.941 --> 00:50:22.774
MATT: Okay.

1290
00:50:24.517 --> 00:50:29.517
TALIESIN: For my spell, I'm going to cast Healing Word.

1291
00:50:34.591 --> 00:50:39.017
Let's just do 3rd-level, because fuck it.

1292
00:50:39.017 --> 00:50:39.850
MATT: All righty, on?

1293
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.041
SAM: "On myself."

1294
00:50:43.591 --> 00:50:44.679
MATT: On Nott, all right just go ahead and roll the dice.

1295
00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:46.210
TALIESIN: I don't have to roll the dice.

1296
00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:47.460
MATT: That's right!

1297
00:50:48.616 --> 00:50:49.881
Grave clerics, man.

1298
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:53.233
TALIESIN: That's 17 hit points back up.

1299
00:50:53.233 --> 00:50:54.316
SAM: I saved!

1300
00:50:55.483 --> 00:50:56.316
LAURA: Good job.

1301
00:50:56.316 --> 00:50:59.065
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to just gently

1302
00:50:59.065 --> 00:51:01.918
get within fighting range of Fjord,

1303
00:51:01.918 --> 00:51:03.303
so that if anyone tries to attack me,

1304
00:51:03.303 --> 00:51:05.130
they also are within Fjord's range.

1305
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.648
MATT: You got it, okay, that finishes your go.

1306
00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:09.065
Fjord, you're up.

1307
00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:12.894
Everyone's gathering around you.

1308
00:51:18.065 --> 00:51:21.093
TRAVIS: Is it an action to ask Pumat a question?

1309
00:51:21.093 --> 00:51:22.630
MATT: If it's a quick one, nah.

1310
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.130
TRAVIS: Can I say: What's in the back room?

1311
00:51:27.428 --> 00:51:28.854
MATT: As he's holding the spell,

1312
00:51:28.854 --> 00:51:32.431
"That's where I do all my enchanting work there.

1313
00:51:32.431 --> 00:51:35.514
"I have tools and equipment pieces. Why?"

1314
00:51:38.121 --> 00:51:39.884
TRAVIS: I'll charge up two Eldritch Blasts,

1315
00:51:39.884 --> 00:51:44.384
and I will hold my action for them to appear.

1316
00:51:44.384 --> 00:51:45.975
MATT: Okay, you got it.

1317
00:51:45.975 --> 00:51:47.291
All right, ending your turn.

1318
00:51:47.291 --> 00:51:50.099
Nott, you're conscious.

1319
00:51:50.099 --> 00:51:51.932
SAM: Thank you, Caduceus.

1320
00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:54.703
This sucks.

1321
00:51:54.703 --> 00:51:56.191
(laughter)

1322
00:51:56.191 --> 00:51:57.024
TRAVIS: Stand up.

1323
00:51:58.466 --> 00:52:00.158
SAM: I will stand up.

1324
00:52:00.158 --> 00:52:02.450
No, I won't stand up, there's no reason.

1325
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.617
Well, am I going anywhere?

1326
00:52:05.476 --> 00:52:06.693
TRAVIS: Just laying there like, ugh!

1327
00:52:06.693 --> 00:52:07.872
LAURA: You should pretend you're still dead.

1328
00:52:07.872 --> 00:52:09.213
You shouldn't have talked at all.

1329
00:52:09.213 --> 00:52:10.249
SAM: I'm just going to lie there.

1330
00:52:10.249 --> 00:52:12.030
MATT: All right, stay prone.

1331
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:15.764
SAM: And prepare that same spell again.

1332
00:52:15.764 --> 00:52:17.248
MATT: Okay, you got it.

1333
00:52:17.248 --> 00:52:20.044
SAM: I don't have any, do I have any potions?

1334
00:52:20.044 --> 00:52:22.945
I don't have any potions, so I'm good, that's it.

1335
00:52:22.945 --> 00:52:24.647
Bonus action, hide.

1336
00:52:24.647 --> 00:52:25.797
MATT: All right, roll a stealth check.

1337
00:52:25.797 --> 00:52:28.403
SAM: I think it knows where I am.

1338
00:52:28.403 --> 00:52:30.228
MARISHA: You're playing possum.
SAM: Yeah, I'm playing possum.

1339
00:52:30.228 --> 00:52:32.145
So 29.

1340
00:52:33.163 --> 00:52:36.521
I'm just going to roll my tongue out of my mouth

1341
00:52:36.521 --> 00:52:38.254
and look dead.

1342
00:52:40.737 --> 00:52:42.664
MATT: Emerging from the ground here.

1343
00:52:42.664 --> 00:52:43.539
MARISHA: Come on, bitch.

1344
00:52:43.539 --> 00:52:44.372
SAM: Perfect.

1345
00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:47.554
MATT: Following the footprints and footsteps

1346
00:52:47.554 --> 00:52:49.407
all heading in that direction,

1347
00:52:49.407 --> 00:52:51.882
she emerges from the ground, right in the center.

1348
00:52:51.882 --> 00:52:54.600
First off, what are the effects of the grease spell?

1349
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.396
LAURA: They have to make a saving throw or go prone.

1350
00:52:57.396 --> 00:52:58.761
TALIESIN: d4.

1351
00:53:00.878 --> 00:53:02.299
LAURA: Let me look at--

1352
00:53:02.299 --> 00:53:04.803
SAM: What if Grease is the most powerful thing we have?

1353
00:53:04.803 --> 00:53:06.934
TALIESIN: Grease 2.
SAM: Grease 2 is pretty powerful.

1354
00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:08.768
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's pretty powerful.

1355
00:53:08.768 --> 00:53:10.277
LAURA: Probably will make the save.

1356
00:53:10.277 --> 00:53:11.662
MATT: What save is it, is it constitutions?

1357
00:53:11.662 --> 00:53:12.865
LAURA: No, it's a dexterity save.

1358
00:53:12.865 --> 00:53:14.102
MATT: Dexterity save?

1359
00:53:14.102 --> 00:53:16.029
Yeah, it's 23.

1360
00:53:16.029 --> 00:53:18.017
LAURA: Yeah, they make the save.

1361
00:53:18.017 --> 00:53:19.884
SAM: I'll cast that Hideous Laughter!

1362
00:53:19.884 --> 00:53:22.140
MATT: All right.
LAURA: But are they still Baned?

1363
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.263
TALIESIN: They're still Baned.

1364
00:53:23.263 --> 00:53:25.555
That was with Bane.

1365
00:53:25.555 --> 00:53:28.968
MATT: They didn't roll a high enough
stealth check this turn.

1366
00:53:28.968 --> 00:53:30.715
Actually rolled a natural one.

1367
00:53:30.715 --> 00:53:32.521
So you were able to gauge

1368
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:34.065
where they were going to come up from the ground,

1369
00:53:34.065 --> 00:53:35.278
so they do not get the surprise action.

1370
00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:38.196
TALIESIN: Sneeze from the Grease on the way up.

1371
00:53:38.196 --> 00:53:41.523
Just made a sound when the mouth hit it.

1372
00:53:41.523 --> 00:53:42.640
LIAM: Oh god!

1373
00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.119
LAURA: Spiritual Guardians?

1374
00:53:44.119 --> 00:53:46.119
Would that be instantly?

1375
00:53:47.394 --> 00:53:48.624
MATT: Does it say on the spell when they enter the space

1376
00:53:48.624 --> 00:53:50.386
for the first time?

1377
00:53:50.386 --> 00:53:51.969
Then yes, that would affect them.

1378
00:53:51.969 --> 00:53:53.555
LAURA: Okay.

1379
00:53:53.555 --> 00:53:55.307
MATT: Saving throw on that's a wisdom?

1380
00:53:55.307 --> 00:53:56.474
LAURA: Wisdom, yes.

1381
00:53:58.489 --> 00:54:00.388
MATT: Oh, that's here.

1382
00:54:00.388 --> 00:54:01.221
14.

1383
00:54:02.061 --> 00:54:02.936
LAURA: Oh, they failed!

1384
00:54:02.936 --> 00:54:04.740
MATT: Yes, so go ahead and roll full damage on that.

1385
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.699
LAURA: Awesome.

1386
00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:07.866
(humming)

1387
00:54:12.129 --> 00:54:12.962
Okay.

1388
00:54:15.134 --> 00:54:16.277
Ah, balls.

1389
00:54:16.277 --> 00:54:17.110
10, 15.

1390
00:54:18.166 --> 00:54:19.733
15 points.
MATT: 15 points of damage,

1391
00:54:19.733 --> 00:54:20.650
you got it.

1392
00:54:23.378 --> 00:54:25.723
And then, so you do that.

1393
00:54:25.723 --> 00:54:28.419
SAM: Well, I'll let you blast.

1394
00:54:28.419 --> 00:54:33.078
MARISHA: Let Beau go first,
just in case I get a stun on her.

1395
00:54:33.078 --> 00:54:35.196
I see her in the grease pit,

1396
00:54:35.196 --> 00:54:40.196
and I'm just going to charge up my fists, and punch her.

1397
00:54:40.203 --> 00:54:41.999
I bailed on that description, I'm sorry.

1398
00:54:41.999 --> 00:54:44.309
(laughter)

1399
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:48.183
MARISHA: It's been a long day.
MATT: It's okay, go for it.

1400
00:54:48.183 --> 00:54:49.791
MARISHA: Pop-pop.

1401
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:51.499
Oh my god, did you see that?

1402
00:54:51.499 --> 00:54:54.627
Okay, 28 and 24.

1403
00:54:54.627 --> 00:54:56.795
MATT: Okay, 28 and 24, both hit, yeah.

1404
00:54:56.795 --> 00:54:59.118
TALIESIN: First one's doubled.

1405
00:54:59.118 --> 00:55:01.566
MARISHA: Oh, okay, let's do this.

1406
00:55:01.566 --> 00:55:03.755
TALIESIN: It just sits there until someone hits.

1407
00:55:03.755 --> 00:55:05.381
MATT: That's right, she didn't hit last round.

1408
00:55:05.381 --> 00:55:09.225
MARISHA: I rolled a six, so 12, so 18 on that first one

1409
00:55:09.225 --> 00:55:10.393
of lightning damage.
TALIESIN: Not just dice,

1410
00:55:10.393 --> 00:55:12.616
it's total damage.

1411
00:55:12.616 --> 00:55:15.059
It's not dice, the whole attack.

1412
00:55:15.059 --> 00:55:16.050
MATT: So it's a six plus--

1413
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.760
MARISHA: Well, I have two attacks.

1414
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.761
TALIESIN: So it would be the first.

1415
00:55:19.761 --> 00:55:21.696
MATT: Which was six plus what?

1416
00:55:21.696 --> 00:55:22.776
MARISHA: Six plus six.

1417
00:55:22.776 --> 00:55:24.776
LIAM and TALIESIN: So 12, so 24.

1418
00:55:25.923 --> 00:55:26.768
MARISHA: Oh!

1419
00:55:26.768 --> 00:55:28.169
TALIESIN: Yeah, whole attack doubles.

1420
00:55:28.169 --> 00:55:30.594
MATT: Yeah, it's vulnerability.

1421
00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:34.303
MARISHA: And then the second attack was terrible.

1422
00:55:34.303 --> 00:55:35.136
Seven damage.

1423
00:55:35.136 --> 00:55:37.522
MATT: Seven damage, got it.

1424
00:55:37.522 --> 00:55:39.325
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.
MATT: Stunning Strike?

1425
00:55:39.325 --> 00:55:41.074
MARISHA: Got it, finally.

1426
00:55:41.074 --> 00:55:43.740
MATT: Minus the d4, yeah.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1427
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:44.573
Bane.

1428
00:55:44.573 --> 00:55:46.775
ALL: Bane!

1429
00:55:46.775 --> 00:55:51.423
TRAVIS: ♪ Bane! I'm gonna live forever! ♪
LAURA: That's where I went, too!

1430
00:55:51.423 --> 00:55:53.448
TALIESIN: ♪ Bane, that fool ♪

1431
00:55:53.448 --> 00:55:54.409
MARISHA: Stunned!

1432
00:55:54.409 --> 00:55:56.992
LAURA: Woo!

1433
00:55:58.075 --> 00:55:59.554
Yas!

1434
00:55:59.554 --> 00:56:00.887
MATT: Well, hold on.

1435
00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:03.243
SAM: I love it.

1436
00:56:03.243 --> 00:56:04.694
MATT: For the first attack, because there's still two

1437
00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.694
of the mirror images up.

1438
00:56:07.627 --> 00:56:09.241
Yeah no, that hits. (laughs)

1439
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:10.743
TALIESIN: Also, does that also get a d4?

1440
00:56:10.743 --> 00:56:11.668
MATT: They both hit.

1441
00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:12.873
LAURA: Yay!

1442
00:56:12.873 --> 00:56:14.983
MATT: It's just a 1d4. Yeah, we're fine.

1443
00:56:14.983 --> 00:56:18.066
But there's still two spectral images floating around.

1444
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:21.508
So that works there.

1445
00:56:21.508 --> 00:56:24.622
MARISHA: Stunned.
MATT: She doesn't get a turn.

1446
00:56:24.622 --> 00:56:28.102
LAURA: Which means she has to stay visible.

1447
00:56:28.102 --> 00:56:29.917
MARISHA: Is there something else I was supposed to do?

1448
00:56:29.917 --> 00:56:31.283
TALIESIN: You did two attacks and a Stunning Strike.

1449
00:56:31.283 --> 00:56:32.215
TRAVIS: I've got my Eldritch Blast.

1450
00:56:32.215 --> 00:56:33.422
MATT: Yes you do, Eldritch Blast.

1451
00:56:33.422 --> 00:56:34.561
MARISHA: I still have my bonus attack.

1452
00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:35.883
MATT: No, it's not your turn, you were holding your action.

1453
00:56:35.883 --> 00:56:37.300
MARISHA: Oh, right.
TRAVIS: 24.

1454
00:56:38.198 --> 00:56:39.031
And 14.

1455
00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:43.204
MATT: You have, technically, advantage on those attacks,

1456
00:56:43.204 --> 00:56:45.716
because they are stunned.

1457
00:56:45.716 --> 00:56:46.549
TALIESIN: 24.

1458
00:56:49.638 --> 00:56:51.168
And a 19 for the second one.

1459
00:56:51.168 --> 00:56:52.748
MATT: Yeah, both hit, critical damage.

1460
00:56:52.748 --> 00:56:56.415
TRAVIS: First one is 18. Nope, sorry, that's a lie.

1461
00:56:57.515 --> 00:56:59.682
13 points of force damage.

1462
00:57:01.272 --> 00:57:04.305
MATT: No it's not, because one of the images absorbs it.

1463
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.363
And the second one?

1464
00:57:07.363 --> 00:57:09.946
TRAVIS: Is 14 points of force damage.

1465
00:57:13.113 --> 00:57:16.118
The d4 is only on melee damage, right?

1466
00:57:16.118 --> 00:57:17.941
MATT: What's that?
TRAVIS: The d4's only on melee?

1467
00:57:17.941 --> 00:57:20.344
MATT: Correct, not ranged.

1468
00:57:20.344 --> 00:57:22.133
SAM: I'm still casting Hideous Laughter,

1469
00:57:22.133 --> 00:57:25.137
even though it's already stuck.

1470
00:57:25.137 --> 00:57:26.388
MATT: It's a wisdom?

1471
00:57:26.388 --> 00:57:28.505
SAM: It's a wisdom, I say to her:

1472
00:57:28.505 --> 00:57:32.838
Ah! You know why I joined a Tharizdun cult?

1473
00:57:33.844 --> 00:57:35.722
Just for the hell of it!

1474
00:57:35.722 --> 00:57:40.070
(laughter, groaning)

1475
00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:41.075
SAM: Wisdom 15.

1476
00:57:41.075 --> 00:57:42.218
MATT: Yeah, 23.

1477
00:57:42.218 --> 00:57:43.333
SAM: Oh, fuck this.

1478
00:57:43.333 --> 00:57:46.259
MATT: Rolled a natural 17, plus your penalty there.

1479
00:57:46.259 --> 00:57:49.024
But nevertheless, emerges on the floor,

1480
00:57:49.024 --> 00:57:52.369
(impacts) and is now crumpled over,

1481
00:57:52.369 --> 00:57:54.188
looking around, eyes wide,

1482
00:57:54.188 --> 00:57:55.838
looking a little bit frustrated,

1483
00:57:55.838 --> 00:57:59.557
but still a slight grin to the face.

1484
00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.325
Can I say Beauregard and Fjord

1485
00:58:05.325 --> 00:58:08.021
both make perception checks for me real fast?

1486
00:58:08.021 --> 00:58:10.159
SAM: Uh-oh, someone else is in the room,

1487
00:58:10.159 --> 00:58:12.812
and it's Yasha, and she's dead.

1488
00:58:12.812 --> 00:58:16.730
TRAVIS: 16, and I still have See Invisibility, though.

1489
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:18.485
MARISHA: Just straight perception?

1490
00:58:18.485 --> 00:58:20.900
13.
MATT: Okay, no worries.

1491
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:24.333
All right, so now, Beauregard, it's your turn.

1492
00:58:24.333 --> 00:58:27.935
MARISHA: Oh, now it's my turn! (yelling).

1493
00:58:27.935 --> 00:58:29.319
(laughter)

1494
00:58:29.319 --> 00:58:31.519
MARISHA: I'm going all ballistic on this girl.

1495
00:58:31.519 --> 00:58:33.057
Full Rocky Balboa.

1496
00:58:33.057 --> 00:58:34.481
MATT: Do it.

1497
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:36.731
MARISHA: Give her that full Rocky.

1498
00:58:38.028 --> 00:58:39.578
One to the ribs, one to the temple.

1499
00:58:39.578 --> 00:58:42.096
That's fucking terrible, yeah, terrible.

1500
00:58:42.096 --> 00:58:42.945
17 and 15.

1501
00:58:42.945 --> 00:58:43.985
MATT: You have advantage on each attack.

1502
00:58:43.985 --> 00:58:47.152
MARISHA: Ooh, okay, well, miss, both of them.

1503
00:58:48.493 --> 00:58:50.243
The first one missed.

1504
00:58:51.954 --> 00:58:53.431
LIAM: Shit. Both shit, all shit.

1505
00:58:53.431 --> 00:58:54.926
Four rolls of shit.

1506
00:58:54.926 --> 00:58:56.341
MARISHA: A natural one and a four.

1507
00:58:56.341 --> 00:59:00.087
MATT: Yeah, so miss-miss on your attack and your action.

1508
00:59:00.087 --> 00:59:03.181
Still have your bonus action.

1509
00:59:07.363 --> 00:59:08.196
TRAVIS: Flurry of Blows?

1510
00:59:08.196 --> 00:59:10.156
MARISHA: Yes, thank you.

1511
00:59:10.156 --> 00:59:10.989
Wow, guys.

1512
00:59:13.775 --> 00:59:15.976
Okay, 26.

1513
00:59:15.976 --> 00:59:18.165
MATT: 26, that hits.

1514
00:59:18.165 --> 00:59:19.957
MARISHA: Nine damage.

1515
00:59:19.957 --> 00:59:21.874
This is the last pop.

1516
00:59:23.111 --> 00:59:25.928
(laughs) 18.

1517
00:59:25.928 --> 00:59:26.928
MATT: 18 misses.

1518
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.439
MARISHA: I rolled and eight and a three.

1519
00:59:30.439 --> 00:59:31.974
Wow.

1520
00:59:31.974 --> 00:59:33.146
MATT: Yeah, they all hit.

1521
00:59:33.146 --> 00:59:35.682
Can't roll high on that last mirror image.

1522
00:59:35.682 --> 00:59:37.578
Okay, that finishes your turn, Beau?

1523
00:59:37.578 --> 00:59:38.411
MARISHA: Yeah.

1524
00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:40.102
MATT: End of your turn, no longer stunned.

1525
00:59:40.102 --> 00:59:41.195
LAURA: Oh!

1526
00:59:41.195 --> 00:59:43.073
MATT: It's 'til the end of your next turn.

1527
00:59:43.073 --> 00:59:46.332
LAURA: Oh, that's balls.
MARISHA: Okay.

1528
00:59:46.332 --> 00:59:48.085
MATT: All right.

1529
00:59:48.085 --> 00:59:49.374
Jester, you're up.

1530
00:59:49.374 --> 00:59:51.948
LAURA: Ugh, okay.

1531
00:59:51.948 --> 00:59:53.373
MATT: But you locked down their round.

1532
00:59:53.373 --> 00:59:56.033
LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense.

1533
00:59:56.033 --> 00:59:57.284
Okay.

1534
00:59:57.284 --> 01:00:00.199
I'm going to make my duplicate turn

1535
01:00:00.199 --> 01:00:01.799
and look at her in the face,

1536
01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:04.673
and then just reach out and go: boop!

1537
01:00:04.673 --> 01:00:07.794
Right on her nose, and she's going to cast Inflict Wounds.

1538
01:00:07.794 --> 01:00:08.868
TRAVIS: Yes!

1539
01:00:08.868 --> 01:00:10.178
LAURA: At 5th-level.

1540
01:00:10.178 --> 01:00:11.928
MATT: Oh, shit!

1541
01:00:11.928 --> 01:00:13.019
TRAVIS: Come on!

1542
01:00:13.019 --> 01:00:14.478
Come on!

1543
01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:15.311
Let's go!

1544
01:00:16.485 --> 01:00:18.123
LAURA: So I have to roll to hit on this.

1545
01:00:18.123 --> 01:00:19.518
MATT: Yeah, you got to roll to hit.

1546
01:00:19.518 --> 01:00:21.168
Melee spell attack.

1547
01:00:21.168 --> 01:00:22.001
LAURA: Okay.

1548
01:00:22.001 --> 01:00:23.334
LIAM: Roll to boop.

1549
01:00:24.683 --> 01:00:26.680
LAURA: Fuck me running!

1550
01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.597
It's a one.

1551
01:00:28.493 --> 01:00:29.326
MATT: You--

1552
01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:32.629
LAURA: I know, you know what, it's okay.

1553
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.070
TRAVIS: That happens with Inflict Wounds a lot, doesn't it?

1554
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.789
LAURA: It just happens to me a lot, yes,

1555
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:39.582
but I'm going to use my bonus action

1556
01:00:39.582 --> 01:00:41.897
to bring my Spiritual Weapon over.

1557
01:00:41.897 --> 01:00:44.164
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: 5th-level spell just took a swirly.

1558
01:00:44.164 --> 01:00:45.211
LAURA: Yeah.

1559
01:00:45.211 --> 01:00:47.093
I try to bring it down over head

1560
01:00:47.093 --> 01:00:48.205
as my duplicate's going--

1561
01:00:48.205 --> 01:00:49.912
MARISHA: It's so painful, I know!

1562
01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.324
LAURA: Oh, that was a two.

1563
01:00:51.324 --> 01:00:54.251
I rolled a one and then a two.

1564
01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:55.584
Where's my jail?

1565
01:00:57.106 --> 01:00:58.418
MATT: What Kickstarter dice is that?

1566
01:00:58.418 --> 01:00:59.292
(laughs)

1567
01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:00.849
LAURA: Now, these are Dispel Dice,

1568
01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:01.855
and I'm not going to blame them,

1569
01:01:01.855 --> 01:01:03.716
because they're really really beautiful.

1570
01:01:03.716 --> 01:01:05.254
MATT: You can blame them.

1571
01:01:05.254 --> 01:01:07.170
SAM: I'll use them for the rest of the night.

1572
01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:10.170
(laughter)

1573
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.738
TALIESIN: That is some punishment enough, I suppose.

1574
01:01:11.738 --> 01:01:14.389
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

1575
01:01:14.389 --> 01:01:15.850
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

1576
01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:18.120
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1577
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.103
LAURA: At least-- you know what?

1578
01:01:20.103 --> 01:01:22.121
I hope she feels at least a little embarrassed,

1579
01:01:22.121 --> 01:01:24.391
because she got booped on the nose.

1580
01:01:24.391 --> 01:01:25.960
MATT: She did.
MARISHA: That's true.

1581
01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.290
MATT: You can see, as soon as the
illusionary Jester pulls back,

1582
01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:33.137
there's a look of (growls) on her face.

1583
01:01:33.137 --> 01:01:35.055
Looks back, like one of those rack focuses,

1584
01:01:35.055 --> 01:01:36.888
and the illusion, and (whooshes) onto you back there,

1585
01:01:36.888 --> 01:01:39.515
doing more actual casting,

1586
01:01:39.515 --> 01:01:42.140
just like, starting piece two and two together.

1587
01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.456
LAURA: Nope.

1588
01:01:43.456 --> 01:01:45.249
MATT: All right, that brings us to Pumat,

1589
01:01:45.249 --> 01:01:47.245
who actually was holding his spell

1590
01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.764
that I forgot to release there.

1591
01:01:49.764 --> 01:01:50.597
LAURA: Fuck!

1592
01:01:51.847 --> 01:01:52.680
Balls!

1593
01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.221
MATT: Which would've been...

1594
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:57.021
it was Acid Arrow.

1595
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:58.572
SAM: Easy.
LAURA: I'm angry!

1596
01:01:58.572 --> 01:02:00.123
LIAM: Hellish Rebuke.

1597
01:02:00.123 --> 01:02:02.574
TALIESIN: You would've had advantage--
LAURA: (yells)

1598
01:02:02.574 --> 01:02:03.894
SAM: You're so emotional.

1599
01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:05.797
LAURA: I'm so-- (laughs)

1600
01:02:05.797 --> 01:02:07.297
You would be, too.

1601
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.412
It could've been so cool.
SAM: I know.

1602
01:02:11.412 --> 01:02:14.935
Everything we're doing tonight <i>could</i> have been so cool.

1603
01:02:14.935 --> 01:02:17.830
MATT: So Pumat deals--

1604
01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:18.913
TALIESIN: Good Pumat.

1605
01:02:18.913 --> 01:02:20.645
LAURA: Roll it, roll it.

1606
01:02:20.645 --> 01:02:22.234
SAM: Watch and learn, oof.

1607
01:02:22.234 --> 01:02:23.292
LAURA: Oof.

1608
01:02:23.292 --> 01:02:26.001
(laughter)

1609
01:02:26.001 --> 01:02:28.689
MARISHA: It's so pretty, though.

1610
01:02:28.689 --> 01:02:29.886
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1611
01:02:29.886 --> 01:02:33.280
LAURA: Shut up.
MATT: 15 points of acid damage.

1612
01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.032
MARISHA: That wasn't as bad.

1613
01:02:35.032 --> 01:02:36.207
TRAVIS: 16.

1614
01:02:36.207 --> 01:02:37.573
16.

1615
01:02:37.573 --> 01:02:38.406
19.

1616
01:02:39.531 --> 01:02:40.364
15.

1617
01:02:40.364 --> 01:02:42.223
LAURA: You keep it over there then.

1618
01:02:42.223 --> 01:02:45.122
MATT: And is currently slathered with acid,

1619
01:02:45.122 --> 01:02:48.375
it'll continue to burn for the next round.

1620
01:02:48.375 --> 01:02:49.828
Now comes to Pumat's turn.

1621
01:02:49.828 --> 01:02:51.199
Pumat is now going to go ahead,

1622
01:02:51.199 --> 01:02:54.532
and seeing how the tide is turning here,

1623
01:02:55.593 --> 01:02:57.584
he's going to go ahead and cast--

1624
01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:00.343
let's see here.

1625
01:03:01.798 --> 01:03:04.845
TRAVIS: What you doing, Pumat?

1626
01:03:04.845 --> 01:03:05.678
MATT: Hmm.

1627
01:03:07.323 --> 01:03:08.331
He's going to go ahead and cast

1628
01:03:08.331 --> 01:03:09.948
Blindness and Deafness on them.

1629
01:03:09.948 --> 01:03:11.289
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

1630
01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:12.581
LIAM: Who's doing what?

1631
01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:14.998
MATT: Pumat is casting Blindness.

1632
01:03:16.076 --> 01:03:17.677
SAM: Which one?

1633
01:03:17.677 --> 01:03:18.607
MATT: Blindness.

1634
01:03:18.607 --> 01:03:20.621
TRAVIS: Oh, Pumat Prime or two?

1635
01:03:20.621 --> 01:03:22.526
MATT: Pumat Prime.

1636
01:03:22.526 --> 01:03:23.768
Pumat two is technically you.

1637
01:03:23.768 --> 01:03:25.694
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's technically me right now.

1638
01:03:25.694 --> 01:03:28.587
MATT: Saving throw does save, unfortunately.

1639
01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:30.920
TALIESIN: With the d4?
MATT: Oh, the d4.

1640
01:03:31.845 --> 01:03:33.762
Still saves.
TALIESIN: Damn it.

1641
01:03:34.966 --> 01:03:38.801
MATT: Doesn't work, but Pumat is
now going to move over here,

1642
01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:40.848
and ducks behind.

1643
01:03:40.848 --> 01:03:42.809
Now that you guys seem to have it taken care of,

1644
01:03:42.809 --> 01:03:44.195
finishes casting the spell,

1645
01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.759
"Oh, that's a poopy chance there,

1646
01:03:45.759 --> 01:03:47.488
I'm just going to go ahead and crouch down,"

1647
01:03:47.488 --> 01:03:49.571
and gets down low behind.

1648
01:03:50.405 --> 01:03:51.769
All right, finishing Pumat's turn,

1649
01:03:51.769 --> 01:03:54.749
that brings us to Caleb and Caduceus.

1650
01:03:54.749 --> 01:03:56.297
LIAM: Yeah, okay, I'm just going to fire off

1651
01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:57.988
five more Magic Missiles, sideways,

1652
01:03:57.988 --> 01:04:01.528
and they'll swirl and twirl and strike right in the middle.

1653
01:04:01.528 --> 01:04:03.065
Those auto-hit.

1654
01:04:03.065 --> 01:04:06.724
That is five, eight, 11 points of damage,

1655
01:04:07.587 --> 01:04:09.659
and then he carefully gets down off the table

1656
01:04:09.659 --> 01:04:12.119
and just feels his way sideways along the wall,

1657
01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:14.214
quietly as he can, towards the stairs,

1658
01:04:14.214 --> 01:04:15.836
but sticking to the wall.

1659
01:04:15.836 --> 01:04:18.693
MATT: Here?
LIAM: As far as he can go.

1660
01:04:18.693 --> 01:04:19.842
Yeah.

1661
01:04:19.842 --> 01:04:21.315
MATT: Are you doing like a stealthy--?

1662
01:04:21.315 --> 01:04:22.839
LIAM: I mean, that would be an action to be stealthy.

1663
01:04:22.839 --> 01:04:24.714
MATT: Yeah, but you're just trying to be--

1664
01:04:24.714 --> 01:04:25.547
LIAM: Just hugging the wall.

1665
01:04:25.547 --> 01:04:27.120
MATT: You got it.
LAURA: I love that you have

1666
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.015
little teeny health potions on the map.

1667
01:04:30.015 --> 01:04:32.204
MATT: I've had like no way to use them for a long time.

1668
01:04:32.204 --> 01:04:34.535
LAURA: They're the teeny tiniest little things in there,

1669
01:04:34.535 --> 01:04:36.354
just getting tossed around.

1670
01:04:36.354 --> 01:04:38.143
MATT: It's like it's a battle room.

1671
01:04:38.143 --> 01:04:39.380
LAURA: So cute.

1672
01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.575
MATT: Battle room. Battle shop.

1673
01:04:40.575 --> 01:04:44.231
All right, that finishes Caleb's turn, Caduceus.

1674
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:45.804
TALIESIN: I'm going to go for a Blight.

1675
01:04:45.804 --> 01:04:47.909
MATT: Go for a Blight, all righty.

1676
01:04:47.909 --> 01:04:48.742
Constitution?

1677
01:04:48.742 --> 01:04:50.325
TALIESIN: Constitution, d4.

1678
01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:52.691
MATT: 13.

1679
01:04:52.691 --> 01:04:53.689
TALIESIN: Oh, nevermind.

1680
01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:54.956
LAURA: You win?

1681
01:04:54.956 --> 01:04:56.465
TALIESIN: I mean, I didn't win.

1682
01:04:56.465 --> 01:04:57.737
LAURA: You won the game?
TALIESIN: I won the game,

1683
01:04:57.737 --> 01:04:59.563
I think D&amp;D is over.
MATT: 11 with the Bane.

1684
01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:00.396
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

1685
01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:01.967
MATT: That's 8d8.

1686
01:05:01.967 --> 01:05:03.796
LAURA: I dipped my hair in my coffee.

1687
01:05:03.796 --> 01:05:06.129
(laughter)

1688
01:05:07.884 --> 01:05:10.186
TALIESIN: Where are my eights?
LIAM: You got the whole caboodle?

1689
01:05:10.186 --> 01:05:11.810
LAURA: Did my husband just laugh at me?

1690
01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:12.643
SAM: Yeah.

1691
01:05:12.643 --> 01:05:14.556
TALIESIN: 8d8, here we go.

1692
01:05:14.556 --> 01:05:15.489
LIAM: Is that a first?

1693
01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:17.010
LAURA: No.
LIAM: You sure?

1694
01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:19.311
LAURA: I think so. (laughs)

1695
01:05:19.311 --> 01:05:20.269
TALIESIN: I'm just going to have to write this down,

1696
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:23.836
because I'm too tired to actually get the math to work.

1697
01:05:23.836 --> 01:05:25.794
LAURA: I'm already rolling ones in the game,

1698
01:05:25.794 --> 01:05:27.852
I don't need them in real life.

1699
01:05:30.247 --> 01:05:31.272
TALIESIN: Ugh.

1700
01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:34.576
11.

1701
01:05:34.576 --> 01:05:36.830
32 points of necrotic damage.

1702
01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.366
MATT: Ooh.

1703
01:05:38.366 --> 01:05:40.191
That's nasty.

1704
01:05:40.191 --> 01:05:42.142
MARISHA: Here we go.

1705
01:05:42.142 --> 01:05:43.075
TALIESIN: You don't happen to be

1706
01:05:43.075 --> 01:05:45.579
part magic plant or anything?

1707
01:05:45.579 --> 01:05:47.642
MATT: No, unfortunately, sorry.

1708
01:05:47.642 --> 01:05:48.475
TALIESIN: Okay.

1709
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.320
MATT: No, but that stun kept her

1710
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.592
from going back into the floor.

1711
01:05:52.592 --> 01:05:53.759
LAURA: That's good.

1712
01:05:55.053 --> 01:05:57.225
MATT: Actually, that wrecked a lot.

1713
01:05:57.225 --> 01:05:58.998
TALIESIN: Yeah, and then--

1714
01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:00.164
LAURA: Yeah, that was huge.

1715
01:06:00.164 --> 01:06:02.239
TALIESIN: Just for-- do I have
anything I can do for a bonus action?

1716
01:06:02.239 --> 01:06:04.773
I don't think there really is anything I can do,

1717
01:06:04.773 --> 01:06:06.048
because I've already done my Hidden Step.

1718
01:06:06.048 --> 01:06:09.015
Yeah, I'm just going to take--

1719
01:06:09.015 --> 01:06:10.395
yeah, I'm just going to stay right where I am.

1720
01:06:10.395 --> 01:06:11.228
MATT: Okay.

1721
01:06:12.847 --> 01:06:14.766
SAM: Was it you, are you--?

1722
01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:16.755
TALIESIN: As close to Fjord as possible.

1723
01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:17.588
TRAVIS: Huh?

1724
01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:19.970
SAM: Whip her.

1725
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:21.257
LAURA: He's already got the other weapon,

1726
01:06:21.257 --> 01:06:23.427
you have to like switch it out.

1727
01:06:23.427 --> 01:06:25.043
SAM: We got to keep her here.

1728
01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:26.744
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know if that would do it.

1729
01:06:26.744 --> 01:06:28.206
So with my bonus action,

1730
01:06:28.206 --> 01:06:32.077
can I cast a Hexblade's Curse on

1731
01:06:32.077 --> 01:06:33.585
her?
MATT: Okay.

1732
01:06:33.585 --> 01:06:35.401
MATT: ♪ Hexblade's Curse! ♪

1733
01:06:37.348 --> 01:06:40.755
SAM: Probably slows her down for one round.

1734
01:06:40.755 --> 01:06:42.707
MATT: Can't do anything today.

1735
01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:44.892
Falling apart here. All right, here we go.

1736
01:06:44.892 --> 01:06:47.113
Stacking them on. (laughs)

1737
01:06:47.113 --> 01:06:51.052
TRAVIS: Can I reach back with the sword

1738
01:06:51.052 --> 01:06:55.468
and pulse the runes, I will cast Banishing Smite

1739
01:06:55.468 --> 01:06:57.722
on this melee strike?

1740
01:06:57.722 --> 01:07:00.465
MATT: Sure, yeah, go for it.

1741
01:07:00.465 --> 01:07:01.798
TRAVIS: So that is...

1742
01:07:05.115 --> 01:07:08.132
I just roll a regular melee attack and see if it hits.

1743
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:12.082
That is...

1744
01:07:12.082 --> 01:07:13.109
20.

1745
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:14.658
MATT: 20.

1746
01:07:14.658 --> 01:07:16.616
She's going to use her reaction to parry,

1747
01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:19.224
add five to her AC, misses.
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

1748
01:07:19.224 --> 01:07:21.336
TRAVIS: Didn't she already burn her reaction?

1749
01:07:21.336 --> 01:07:24.188
No, that was-- because her turn-- okay, nevermind.

1750
01:07:25.405 --> 01:07:29.180
TRAVIS: Wow, does that cancel out that spell, too?

1751
01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.013
MATT: Look at the spell,

1752
01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:31.847
see if says "'til the next attack hits."

1753
01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:34.622
TRAVIS: It is the next attack, next melee attack.

1754
01:07:34.622 --> 01:07:36.741
MATT: The next melee attack?

1755
01:07:36.741 --> 01:07:37.574
TRAVIS: It is...

1756
01:07:40.801 --> 01:07:42.631
I've never used it before.

1757
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:43.588
MATT: It's okay.

1758
01:07:43.588 --> 01:07:44.893
TRAVIS: Next time you hit a creature with a weapon.

1759
01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:46.731
MATT: Hit a creature, so it's still there,

1760
01:07:46.731 --> 01:07:48.960
you have a second attack.

1761
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.837
That can still work.

1762
01:07:49.837 --> 01:07:52.110
TRAVIS: Oh, great, okay.

1763
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:53.098
MARISHA: Get it.

1764
01:07:53.098 --> 01:07:55.236
TRAVIS: Yeah, 24!

1765
01:07:55.236 --> 01:08:00.185
MATT: 24 hits, let's roll to see if the last mirror image--

1766
01:08:02.992 --> 01:08:04.156
No, that hits.

1767
01:08:04.156 --> 01:08:05.564
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1768
01:08:05.564 --> 01:08:06.771
SAM: What does this do?

1769
01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:11.236
TRAVIS: 5d10 damage,

1770
01:08:11.236 --> 01:08:12.544
and...

1771
01:08:12.544 --> 01:08:13.377
let's see.

1772
01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:16.717
Oh, come on.

1773
01:08:19.463 --> 01:08:20.296
24.

1774
01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:25.055
33, one more, right?

1775
01:08:25.055 --> 01:08:26.593
LIAM: That was five.
TRAVIS: That was five, okay.

1776
01:08:26.593 --> 01:08:28.176
33 points of...

1777
01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:30.976
force damage, I think.

1778
01:08:34.007 --> 01:08:36.026
Did it happen to reduce the target

1779
01:08:36.026 --> 01:08:38.193
to 50 hit points or fewer?

1780
01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:40.908
MATT: Yes.

1781
01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.422
TRAVIS: It banishes it.

1782
01:08:42.422 --> 01:08:43.800
MATT: (laughs)

1783
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.704
SAM: Whoa!

1784
01:08:45.704 --> 01:08:47.115
MARISHA: To where?
TALIESIN: To where?

1785
01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:48.781
TRAVIS: "If the target is native
to a different plane of existence

1786
01:08:48.781 --> 01:08:49.614
"than the one you're on,

1787
01:08:49.614 --> 01:08:51.756
"the target disappears, returning to its home plane.

1788
01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:53.261
"If the target is native to the plane you're on,

1789
01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:56.671
"the creature vanishes into a harmless demi-plane.

1790
01:08:56.671 --> 01:08:58.463
"While there, the target is incapacitated,

1791
01:08:58.463 --> 01:09:00.022
"and remains there until the spell ends,

1792
01:09:00.022 --> 01:09:01.437
"at which point, the target reappears

1793
01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.801
"in the space it left."

1794
01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:03.972
SAM: How long is the spell?

1795
01:09:03.972 --> 01:09:05.223
TRAVIS: One minute.

1796
01:09:05.223 --> 01:09:07.286
LAURA: Okay, so we can prepare.

1797
01:09:07.286 --> 01:09:08.536
So we can heal!

1798
01:09:08.536 --> 01:09:09.694
TRAVIS: Whack!

1799
01:09:11.324 --> 01:09:15.717
MATT: You watch as this large arc
of divine light-green energy,

1800
01:09:15.717 --> 01:09:18.397
these spirals of strange vines

1801
01:09:18.397 --> 01:09:20.074
begin to curl around the blade.

1802
01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:21.843
The first swing goes wide,

1803
01:09:21.843 --> 01:09:23.691
you see she dodges out of the way,

1804
01:09:23.691 --> 01:09:26.614
immediately taken aback by this sudden burst

1805
01:09:26.614 --> 01:09:28.282
of divine energy. The second swing, however,

1806
01:09:28.282 --> 01:09:29.480
is a back-hand to the side.

1807
01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:30.962
As it impacts, it flashes,

1808
01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:34.174
and you can see the vines reach out and wrap around her,

1809
01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:35.445
and suddenly, she's cocooned,

1810
01:09:35.445 --> 01:09:36.464
very much in the way that you were

1811
01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:37.679
when you made the transition,

1812
01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:39.160
except the cocoon suddenly crumbles,

1813
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.721
and there's nobody there.

1814
01:09:40.721 --> 01:09:42.794
TRAVIS: Wow.
LAURA: Tight.

1815
01:09:42.794 --> 01:09:45.071
How long does it last?

1816
01:09:45.071 --> 01:09:46.738
TRAVIS: One minute, you got one minute.

1817
01:09:46.738 --> 01:09:48.138
LAURA: Oh, all my shit will disappear.

1818
01:09:48.138 --> 01:09:49.949
SAM: I need a healing potion!

1819
01:09:49.949 --> 01:09:52.274
LAURA: Jester duplicate and the Spiritual Weapon.

1820
01:09:52.274 --> 01:09:53.774
SAM: Someone heal me!

1821
01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.469
MARISHA: Should we down potions?

1822
01:09:56.469 --> 01:10:00.011
LAURA: I'll jump over and cast Cure Wounds at 3rd-level.

1823
01:10:00.011 --> 01:10:01.753
SAM: On who?
LAURA: You, Nott.

1824
01:10:01.753 --> 01:10:02.844
SAM: On me?
LAURA: Yeah.

1825
01:10:02.844 --> 01:10:05.537
LIAM: Do you just bring her back
after we've had a moment to breathe?

1826
01:10:05.537 --> 01:10:08.465
TRAVIS: It just brings it back after one minute.

1827
01:10:08.465 --> 01:10:11.164
MATT: Did add a d4 for being huge?

1828
01:10:11.164 --> 01:10:12.533
MARISHA: Thank you.

1829
01:10:12.533 --> 01:10:14.670
TALIESIN: Which is also 3d8.

1830
01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:17.061
TRAVIS: Four points, so eight.

1831
01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:18.561
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good.

1832
01:10:19.619 --> 01:10:21.622
MATT: 31 points of damage on one strike, not too bad.

1833
01:10:21.622 --> 01:10:23.398
TALIESIN: 23 hit points back.

1834
01:10:23.398 --> 01:10:26.216
LIAM: "If the spell ends before one minute has passed,

1835
01:10:26.216 --> 01:10:28.756
"if it ends before a minute, the target reappears.

1836
01:10:28.756 --> 01:10:32.370
"Otherwise, if it doesn't end in under a minute,

1837
01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:33.792
"it stays on its own plane."

1838
01:10:33.792 --> 01:10:35.438
Am I mistaken?

1839
01:10:35.438 --> 01:10:37.220
TRAVIS: "It remains there until
"the spell ends at which point--"

1840
01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.851
LIAM: But <i>you</i> could drop it.

1841
01:10:38.851 --> 01:10:42.885
LAURA: No, that's if it's native to a different plane.

1842
01:10:42.885 --> 01:10:44.419
SAM: It is.

1843
01:10:44.419 --> 01:10:45.252
LAURA: Right.

1844
01:10:45.252 --> 01:10:46.085
MATT: There's a difference between Banishment

1845
01:10:46.085 --> 01:10:47.928
and Banishing Smite, they're different spells.

1846
01:10:47.928 --> 01:10:49.928
Yeah, Banishing Smite...

1847
01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:55.781
Yeah, it comes back when spell's done.

1848
01:10:55.781 --> 01:10:57.959
It's not quite an awesome banishment.

1849
01:10:57.959 --> 01:10:59.070
Does a shit ton of damage as well,

1850
01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.138
that's the benefit there.

1851
01:11:00.138 --> 01:11:01.790
TRAVIS: It's like a do whatever you need.

1852
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.439
LIAM: Good shit.
MATT: Correct, all right.

1853
01:11:03.439 --> 01:11:05.542
So you guys are getting prepped here.

1854
01:11:05.542 --> 01:11:07.864
What are you doing?

1855
01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:09.944
LAURA: But she'll reappear right there.

1856
01:11:09.944 --> 01:11:11.477
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Okay.

1857
01:11:11.477 --> 01:11:13.560
Does the grease stay out?

1858
01:11:14.556 --> 01:11:16.009
The grease is still there.

1859
01:11:16.009 --> 01:11:17.692
MATT: How long does the grease stand?

1860
01:11:17.692 --> 01:11:19.006
LAURA: It doesn't say.

1861
01:11:19.006 --> 01:11:21.400
Oh no, one minute, sorry, my mistake, sorry.

1862
01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.873
MARISHA: Okay, where does she go then?

1863
01:11:22.873 --> 01:11:24.963
LAURA: She's right, she's going to appear right there.

1864
01:11:24.963 --> 01:11:26.588
MARISHA: I'm going to reposition

1865
01:11:26.588 --> 01:11:30.954
to where I'm right there in between.

1866
01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.371
How long is Fjord, Big Fjord?

1867
01:11:34.226 --> 01:11:36.439
Do you stay Big Fjord?

1868
01:11:36.439 --> 01:11:37.499
SAM: Big Fjord!

1869
01:11:37.499 --> 01:11:38.999
LIAM: Oh, Fjord's big.

1870
01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:43.820
TALIESIN: I'm going to be-- instead of-- okay.

1871
01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.854
SAM: Hey, I'm going to shout at Jester.

1872
01:11:45.854 --> 01:11:49.571
Jester, look out the window, see if anyone's outside!

1873
01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:50.773
LAURA: Can I peek out the window and see?

1874
01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:53.192
MATT: Fjord does shrink.

1875
01:11:53.192 --> 01:11:55.442
MARISHA: I'm going to lose my gloves.

1876
01:11:57.321 --> 01:11:59.451
SAM: I'm going to run across to the other window

1877
01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:00.534
and look out.

1878
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:02.363
MATT: Over here?
SAM: Yep.

1879
01:12:02.363 --> 01:12:04.101
Just to see if anyone's outside.

1880
01:12:04.101 --> 01:12:05.933
MATT: Currently, there's people walking outside.

1881
01:12:05.933 --> 01:12:07.492
SAM: Any enemies?

1882
01:12:07.492 --> 01:12:09.256
MATT: Make a perception check.

1883
01:12:09.256 --> 01:12:10.643
SAM: One.

1884
01:12:10.643 --> 01:12:12.584
MATT: Looks pretty safe.
SAM: 'Kay.

1885
01:12:12.584 --> 01:12:14.525
Jester, what you got?

1886
01:12:14.525 --> 01:12:16.582
LAURA: Do I see anything outside?

1887
01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.749
MATT: Make a perception check.

1888
01:12:21.311 --> 01:12:22.831
LAURA: 20.

1889
01:12:22.831 --> 01:12:23.664
MATT: 20.

1890
01:12:25.423 --> 01:12:27.748
You see people walking through the street,

1891
01:12:27.748 --> 01:12:29.258
they hear a noise, and then it's quiet,

1892
01:12:29.258 --> 01:12:30.944
they're not really sure what's going on,

1893
01:12:30.944 --> 01:12:34.430
and I forgot, because Grease is a concentration spell,

1894
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:36.471
it didn't have any effect on this.

1895
01:12:36.471 --> 01:12:38.347
You had to choose between that or your illusion,

1896
01:12:38.347 --> 01:12:40.841
because you are concentrating on your thing.

1897
01:12:40.841 --> 01:12:42.973
That's fine now, but just to remember in the future.

1898
01:12:42.973 --> 01:12:44.323
LAURA: Yeah.

1899
01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:47.268
TALIESIN: Yeah, I suppose one
of the last things I'm going to do--

1900
01:12:47.268 --> 01:12:50.080
LAURA: I thought because it came out of the wand

1901
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:50.913
that I didn't have to--

1902
01:12:50.913 --> 01:12:51.746
MATT: You're still maintaining concentration

1903
01:12:51.746 --> 01:12:53.679
on the spell that you cast through it.

1904
01:12:53.679 --> 01:12:54.653
LAURA: Understandable.

1905
01:12:54.653 --> 01:12:56.352
MATT: That way, you can't have
multiple things concentrating.

1906
01:12:56.352 --> 01:12:57.920
SAM: I'm going to use the rest of the minute

1907
01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.542
to find a place under the table over there and hide

1908
01:13:01.542 --> 01:13:04.044
as best as I can.
MATT: Roll for a hide.

1909
01:13:04.044 --> 01:13:06.253
SAM: Terrible, awful, terrible, 16.

1910
01:13:06.253 --> 01:13:07.848
MATT: 16, okay.

1911
01:13:07.848 --> 01:13:09.805
Everyone else set?

1912
01:13:09.805 --> 01:13:10.860
LAURA: Are you sure?

1913
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.775
TALIESIN: Grease is not a concentration.

1914
01:13:12.775 --> 01:13:15.376
LAURA: Are you sure Grease is concentration?

1915
01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:18.510
It doesn't say it on the thing.

1916
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:19.681
MATT: Okay, then nevermind.

1917
01:13:19.681 --> 01:13:22.500
I assumed it was, my bad.

1918
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.011
You're right, so nevermind, you're good.

1919
01:13:24.011 --> 01:13:24.844
TALIESIN: Instead of healing myself,

1920
01:13:24.844 --> 01:13:26.508
I'm going to use Antilife Shell.

1921
01:13:26.508 --> 01:13:29.925
MATT: I've literally never had anyone use Grease in a game

1922
01:13:29.925 --> 01:13:32.635
in five years, which is a shame,

1923
01:13:32.635 --> 01:13:34.783
it's a great 1st-level spell.

1924
01:13:34.783 --> 01:13:36.668
TALIESIN: What's that other
one I was going to do? I'm sorry,

1925
01:13:36.668 --> 01:13:37.501
I'm having a little trouble,

1926
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:41.084
I'm shaking too much to make my thing work.

1927
01:13:42.522 --> 01:13:43.755
SAM: He wants to do something,

1928
01:13:43.755 --> 01:13:47.077
and I'm going to hold a shoot action.

1929
01:13:47.077 --> 01:13:49.464
LIAM: Caleb's Invisibility will drop in this minute,

1930
01:13:49.464 --> 01:13:51.178
so he's going to go up to the top of the stairs

1931
01:13:51.178 --> 01:13:53.430
and sit in whatever doorway is up there,

1932
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:55.009
peering down from above,

1933
01:13:55.009 --> 01:13:57.438
and everyone sees Frumpkin come dink, dink, dink,

1934
01:13:57.438 --> 01:14:00.081
down the stairs, and sits on the table at center.

1935
01:14:00.081 --> 01:14:00.914
MATT: Okay.

1936
01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:04.086
LIAM: Actually, stands on the floor next to Beauregard.

1937
01:14:04.086 --> 01:14:05.182
MATT: Okay, right there?

1938
01:14:05.182 --> 01:14:06.855
LIAM: Yeah, precisely there.

1939
01:14:06.855 --> 01:14:09.177
TALIESIN: I also put a Death Ward on myself.

1940
01:14:09.177 --> 01:14:10.010
MATT: Okay, Death Ward's on you.

1941
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:12.510
TALIESIN: So I've got a Death Ward and an Antilife Shell,

1942
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:16.094
and I'm readying, because I don't want to get hit.

1943
01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:17.724
MATT: Is Antilife Shell concentration?

1944
01:14:17.724 --> 01:14:19.192
TALIESIN: It is concentration.
MATT: Nice, all right,

1945
01:14:19.192 --> 01:14:21.156
so you were just like, nope!

1946
01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:23.167
TALIESIN: I'm putting a 10-foot wall around me,

1947
01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:27.667
where no enemies can get within 10 feet of me.

1948
01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:28.700
MATT: You got it.

1949
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.813
TRAVIS: Can I get up on the table where Nott was, over here?

1950
01:14:31.813 --> 01:14:33.387
MATT: Also, you're still a Pumat?

1951
01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:34.507
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to stay a Pumat.

1952
01:14:34.507 --> 01:14:36.074
MATT: Okay.

1953
01:14:36.074 --> 01:14:37.431
In the same place?

1954
01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:40.555
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- yeah, I'm going to stay up there,

1955
01:14:40.555 --> 01:14:41.875
I just want to be in the middle of a bunch of people.

1956
01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:43.531
And also, because my 10-foot little radius

1957
01:14:43.531 --> 01:14:44.985
is good for anybody.

1958
01:14:44.985 --> 01:14:47.004
MATT: Pumat's going to go ahead and move over here.

1959
01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:50.361
"Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and move on this table.

1960
01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:51.619
"Tables seem to be safe, right?

1961
01:14:51.619 --> 01:14:54.824
"It's working out well for everyone?"

1962
01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.224
TALIESIN: I may-- yeah...

1963
01:14:59.732 --> 01:15:01.668
we're pretty spread out.

1964
01:15:01.668 --> 01:15:03.945
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm going to trust my little thing.

1965
01:15:03.945 --> 01:15:06.550
Then I'm readying my--

1966
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:07.810
yeah, I've got something ready to go.

1967
01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:08.988
MATT: What are you readying?

1968
01:15:08.988 --> 01:15:12.362
TALIESIN: The same thing I did last time,
the Path to the Grave.

1969
01:15:12.362 --> 01:15:13.365
MATT: Okay, got it.

1970
01:15:13.365 --> 01:15:14.996
TRAVIS: I'm going to climb up on that table,

1971
01:15:14.996 --> 01:15:18.815
and can I hold the last charge of the sword,

1972
01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:21.108
and I'll hold Faerie Fire?

1973
01:15:21.108 --> 01:15:22.120
MATT: Sure.
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

1974
01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.737
I'll hold an attack, waiting for her

1975
01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:27.177
so I can clock her as soon as she reappears.

1976
01:15:27.177 --> 01:15:28.269
MATT: Okay.

1977
01:15:28.269 --> 01:15:30.143
LIAM: When I think there's 10 seconds left,

1978
01:15:30.143 --> 01:15:34.045
I take out the cat mint and bring up Cat's Ire,

1979
01:15:34.045 --> 01:15:36.932
and the claw is floating center of the room,

1980
01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:38.515
10 feet in the air.

1981
01:15:40.112 --> 01:15:43.445
Basically above Beauregard and Frumpkin.

1982
01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.207
MATT: There you go.

1983
01:15:48.436 --> 01:15:49.740
That's a lot going on right there.

1984
01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.990
LAURA: I'm going to bring my duplicate back up.

1985
01:15:53.896 --> 01:15:55.054
TALIESIN: Actually, back me up against the wall.

1986
01:15:55.054 --> 01:15:56.298
LAURA: I'm going to try to boop her again

1987
01:15:56.298 --> 01:15:57.294
as soon as she comes back in,

1988
01:15:57.294 --> 01:15:59.340
so she's going to go right in front of her.

1989
01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.636
MATT: Right here?

1990
01:16:00.636 --> 01:16:03.601
LAURA: As close to-- yeah, right in her face.

1991
01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.018
MATT: You got it. Okay.

1992
01:16:08.065 --> 01:16:10.351
LAURA: So I'm holding Inflict Wounds again.

1993
01:16:10.351 --> 01:16:11.747
MATT: Everyone situated?
LAURA: Yeah.

1994
01:16:11.747 --> 01:16:14.319
MATT: All right, as the minute comes to a conclusion,

1995
01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:15.767
Bane is no longer there,

1996
01:16:15.767 --> 01:16:17.886
Hexblade's Curse lasts for--?

1997
01:16:17.886 --> 01:16:22.386
TRAVIS: Let me check.
I think you're probably onto something.

1998
01:16:24.141 --> 01:16:26.372
SAM: What a crazy-looking battle map this is.

1999
01:16:26.372 --> 01:16:27.330
TRAVIS: It lasts for one minute,

2000
01:16:27.330 --> 01:16:28.765
so it's toast.
SAM: Giant orange paw

2001
01:16:28.765 --> 01:16:30.567
in the middle of the room.

2002
01:16:30.567 --> 01:16:32.542
MATT: Acid damage it took from Pumat's Acid Arrow.

2003
01:16:32.542 --> 01:16:34.409
TRAVIS: Good call.

2004
01:16:34.409 --> 01:16:38.690
MATT: And (whooshes) appears there.

2005
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.141
Who's taking the first attack?

2006
01:16:40.141 --> 01:16:41.307
LIAM: I'll swipe.

2007
01:16:41.307 --> 01:16:43.571
TRAVIS: Let me hit Faerie Fire,
because everybody else gets--

2008
01:16:43.571 --> 01:16:45.406
LIAM: I have advantage on what
I want to do anyway, but go for it.

2009
01:16:45.406 --> 01:16:47.464
TRAVIS: No, go for it.
LAURA: Well, no, do it.

2010
01:16:47.464 --> 01:16:48.596
TRAVIS: So Faerie Fire.

2011
01:16:48.596 --> 01:16:51.057
MATT: We're essentially going through the same--

2012
01:16:51.057 --> 01:16:52.557
LAURA: Oh, initiative order.

2013
01:16:52.557 --> 01:16:53.491
MATT: I'll say initiative order for this,

2014
01:16:53.491 --> 01:16:55.161
instead of everything happening at once.

2015
01:16:55.161 --> 01:16:56.284
No, it's the same initiative order,

2016
01:16:56.284 --> 01:16:57.843
because combat hasn't really ended,

2017
01:16:57.843 --> 01:17:00.060
so we'll say, Nott.

2018
01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.085
SAM: I fire 29 to hit.

2019
01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:03.277
MATT: That hits!

2020
01:17:03.277 --> 01:17:06.027
SAM: Do I get sneak attack damag--

2021
01:17:07.078 --> 01:17:08.397
MATT: You're not hidden.

2022
01:17:08.397 --> 01:17:09.616
SAM: I hid.

2023
01:17:09.616 --> 01:17:12.323
MATT: But rolled really low,
and she has a higher perception,

2024
01:17:12.323 --> 01:17:14.714
but she is technically in...

2025
01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.956
base-to-base-- or melee with Beauregard,

2026
01:17:16.956 --> 01:17:18.081
so yes, you do.

2027
01:17:18.081 --> 01:17:19.081
SAM: All right.

2028
01:17:20.025 --> 01:17:21.387
Let's drop it.

2029
01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:22.734
Ooh, lots of threes.

2030
01:17:22.734 --> 01:17:24.417
MATT: What was the total attack on that two?

2031
01:17:24.417 --> 01:17:25.338
SAM: It was a 29.

2032
01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:26.255
MATT: 29, yeah.

2033
01:17:27.938 --> 01:17:29.637
Let me roll.

2034
01:17:29.637 --> 01:17:32.014
Nope, actually, the last mirror image absorbs the attack.

2035
01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:32.847
LAURA: Aw.

2036
01:17:34.061 --> 01:17:35.155
MARISHA: She still has that?

2037
01:17:35.155 --> 01:17:36.719
MATT: She had one left.

2038
01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.060
But now they're gone.

2039
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.687
So now, all the images have vanished,

2040
01:17:39.687 --> 01:17:42.378
that slight weird shimmery aspect of her body

2041
01:17:42.378 --> 01:17:44.612
is now gone, and you can see her

2042
01:17:44.612 --> 01:17:47.284
as physically there as you could imagine she could be.

2043
01:17:47.284 --> 01:17:49.896
LIAM: Mirror image is gone, because it lasts a minute.

2044
01:17:49.896 --> 01:17:51.062
MATT: Oh, this isn't a spell,

2045
01:17:51.062 --> 01:17:53.867
this is an inherent ability.
LIAM: Oh, it's a feature. Okay.

2046
01:17:53.867 --> 01:17:55.381
Sweet.

2047
01:17:55.381 --> 01:17:57.885
MATT: It acts similar to it.

2048
01:17:57.885 --> 01:17:59.183
SAM: Okay.

2049
01:17:59.183 --> 01:18:00.299
MATT: So that finishes your go.

2050
01:18:00.299 --> 01:18:01.718
Next up is Beauregard.

2051
01:18:01.718 --> 01:18:03.338
TALIESIN: Jester, you don't get two attacks?

2052
01:18:03.338 --> 01:18:05.485
LAURA: No, these are held actions.
TALIESIN: Oh, held actions, right.

2053
01:18:05.485 --> 01:18:08.751
MARISHA: I'm just going to go with a giant haymaker.

2054
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.624
MATT: So you get two strikes.

2055
01:18:10.624 --> 01:18:12.326
SAM: Make that hay.

2056
01:18:12.326 --> 01:18:14.789
MARISHA: ♪ Here we go ♪

2057
01:18:14.789 --> 01:18:17.170
LIAM: That's cocked.

2058
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.170
MATT: All right.

2059
01:18:19.927 --> 01:18:23.495
MARISHA: 19, so 29, but the first one failed.

2060
01:18:23.495 --> 01:18:24.499
15.

2061
01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.170
MATT: 15, yeah, 15 hits.

2062
01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:29.880
Or-- the 15 you rolled, you mean, yeah.

2063
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.407
MARISHA: 15 doesn't hit, does it?

2064
01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:33.233
MATT: Sorry, I thought you said you rolled a 15 in the dice.

2065
01:18:33.233 --> 01:18:34.258
The first one, 15, misses.

2066
01:18:34.258 --> 01:18:36.066
MARISHA: Yes, and then I rolled a 19.

2067
01:18:36.066 --> 01:18:38.921
MATT: Oh, it was a 19, I mis-saw it, go for it.

2068
01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:41.150
MARISHA: That's nine damage.

2069
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:42.483
Stunning Strike.

2070
01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:46.150
Come on.

2071
01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:47.400
MATT: That is a 17?

2072
01:18:48.249 --> 01:18:49.366
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Does that work?

2073
01:18:49.366 --> 01:18:51.575
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, saves.

2074
01:18:51.575 --> 01:18:52.833
MATT: Oh, it does not have a Bane on it yet.

2075
01:18:52.833 --> 01:18:55.249
TALIESIN: Nope, no Bane yet.
MATT: All right, saves.

2076
01:18:55.249 --> 01:18:56.683
All right, that finishes your go.

2077
01:18:56.683 --> 01:18:57.795
Jester.

2078
01:18:57.795 --> 01:18:58.969
LAURA: (sadly) Boop.

2079
01:18:58.969 --> 01:19:00.196
TRAVIS: Aw!

2080
01:19:00.196 --> 01:19:01.098
MARISHA: Come on!

2081
01:19:01.098 --> 01:19:02.576
♪ I believe you can fly ♪

2082
01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:03.739
LAURA: 5th-level!

2083
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:04.992
SAM: A 5th-level boop?

2084
01:19:04.992 --> 01:19:06.387
LAURA: 5th-level boop.

2085
01:19:06.387 --> 01:19:08.772
SAM: Whoa!
LAURA: Does that count?

2086
01:19:08.772 --> 01:19:11.414
It probably counts, I mean, it's flat.

2087
01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:12.535
SAM: It's a cool roll.

2088
01:19:12.535 --> 01:19:14.555
LAURA: Yeah, but it's only a 15 total.

2089
01:19:14.555 --> 01:19:16.323
MATT: 15 total does not hit, unfortunately.

2090
01:19:16.323 --> 01:19:18.274
LAURA: If only, Fjord, you had gone first,

2091
01:19:18.274 --> 01:19:19.730
then I could've had advantage.

2092
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:20.563
TRAVIS: Sorry.

2093
01:19:20.563 --> 01:19:22.689
LAURA: I could've held it 'til after Fjord went.

2094
01:19:22.689 --> 01:19:25.875
No, I couldn't, that's a reaction.

2095
01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:28.083
MATT: Because it's a reaction,
it's not like a trained thing,

2096
01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:31.050
and so that was the easiest way to go through it.

2097
01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.633
Pumat is going to go ahead and release...

2098
01:19:33.633 --> 01:19:34.758
he's going to attempt--

2099
01:19:34.758 --> 01:19:37.383
SAM: Are you eating ice cream over there,
or is that an acai bowl?

2100
01:19:37.383 --> 01:19:39.578
MATT: He's going to attempt to Dominate Person.

2101
01:19:39.578 --> 01:19:40.561
TALIESIN: Ooh.

2102
01:19:40.561 --> 01:19:42.742
SAM: Dominate Person?

2103
01:19:42.742 --> 01:19:45.596
MATT: But 20, so she resists.

2104
01:19:45.596 --> 01:19:46.847
LAURA: Yeah, because she got advantage on it,

2105
01:19:46.847 --> 01:19:49.357
that's why I didn't cast it.

2106
01:19:49.357 --> 01:19:53.054
MATT: All right, that brings it to Caleb and Caduceus.

2107
01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:55.098
LIAM: My giant cat's claw grapples.

2108
01:19:55.098 --> 01:19:57.266
MATT: Grapples, okay.

2109
01:19:57.266 --> 01:19:58.127
SAM: Grappling hand.

2110
01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.381
LIAM: And she's medium, right?

2111
01:20:00.381 --> 01:20:02.289
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Yeah, so it's at advantage.

2112
01:20:02.289 --> 01:20:03.456
Strength, ooh.

2113
01:20:04.577 --> 01:20:07.648
But it's very high,

2114
01:20:07.648 --> 01:20:09.356
so that is a...

2115
01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:11.972
32.

2116
01:20:11.972 --> 01:20:13.610
MATT: 32.
LIAM: 34.

2117
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:16.496
MATT: The cat's claw grabs down

2118
01:20:16.496 --> 01:20:18.467
and seems to be unable to grasp.

2119
01:20:18.467 --> 01:20:21.138
The body's seeming momentary immaterial,

2120
01:20:21.138 --> 01:20:22.423
immune to being grappled.

2121
01:20:22.423 --> 01:20:27.392
TRAVIS: Ooh, interesting.
MATT: All right, Caduceus.

2122
01:20:27.392 --> 01:20:28.825
LIAM: That's a bonus action, though, yeah?

2123
01:20:28.825 --> 01:20:29.658
MATT: That's right, yeah.

2124
01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.409
LIAM: So Magic Missile.

2125
01:20:31.409 --> 01:20:33.153
MATT: Go for it, roll damage.

2126
01:20:33.153 --> 01:20:34.332
(projectiles impacting)

2127
01:20:34.332 --> 01:20:35.312
What level?
LIAM: Fifth.

2128
01:20:35.312 --> 01:20:36.145
MATT: Okay.

2129
01:20:38.448 --> 01:20:39.976
LAURA: We weren't able to hold a bonus action

2130
01:20:39.976 --> 01:20:40.885
and a regular action?

2131
01:20:40.885 --> 01:20:41.913
MARISHA: I know, I just did my action.

2132
01:20:41.913 --> 01:20:43.357
MATT: That's right.

2133
01:20:43.357 --> 01:20:44.357
I would say...

2134
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:46.967
TALIESIN: The cat's claw has its own movement, though.

2135
01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:48.249
LIAM: The cat's claw's bonus action.

2136
01:20:48.249 --> 01:20:49.966
MATT: Yeah, it's a bonus action,
so that would be your held action,

2137
01:20:49.966 --> 01:20:52.248
if that's what you wanted to use it for.
So no Magic Missile on that.

2138
01:20:52.248 --> 01:20:53.550
All right, Caduceus.

2139
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:54.508
TALIESIN: Path to the Grave.

2140
01:20:54.508 --> 01:20:56.530
MATT: Path to the Grave, Fjord?

2141
01:20:56.530 --> 01:21:00.971
TRAVIS: Faerie Fire, saving throw, dexterity 15?

2142
01:21:02.821 --> 01:21:04.571
MATT: Yeah, that's a 20.

2143
01:21:06.106 --> 01:21:08.182
TRAVIS: (sighs)

2144
01:21:08.182 --> 01:21:09.484
SAM: Glitter, pah!

2145
01:21:09.484 --> 01:21:11.351
LAURA: We all prepped, and we all whiffed.

2146
01:21:11.351 --> 01:21:14.038
MATT: That was a pretty rough round of preparation,

2147
01:21:14.038 --> 01:21:14.970
I'm sorry, guys.

2148
01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.943
SAM: Beauregard got nine points of damage.

2149
01:21:16.943 --> 01:21:18.609
MARISHA: Big old nine damage.
MATT: That's true.

2150
01:21:18.609 --> 01:21:19.732
All right, Nott, you're up.

2151
01:21:19.732 --> 01:21:23.065
SAM: Oh, okay, I will fire again.

2152
01:21:23.065 --> 01:21:23.898
Attack!

2153
01:21:23.898 --> 01:21:24.917
MATT: Want the claw to have been down on the floor?

2154
01:21:24.917 --> 01:21:27.537
SAM: Goddamn it!

2155
01:21:27.537 --> 01:21:28.370
12.

2156
01:21:29.825 --> 01:21:31.208
Fire again, bonus action!

2157
01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.646
MATT: All right.

2158
01:21:32.646 --> 01:21:34.199
SAM: Okay, 21.

2159
01:21:34.199 --> 01:21:37.343
MATT: 21, reflex-- or reaction to parry.

2160
01:21:37.343 --> 01:21:39.103
SAM: Goddamn it!

2161
01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.581
(laughter)

2162
01:21:40.581 --> 01:21:42.228
LIAM: She's amazing.

2163
01:21:42.228 --> 01:21:43.565
She's like spinning, whipping around,

2164
01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.459
things are going through her.

2165
01:21:45.459 --> 01:21:47.476
SAM: Maybe I should just jump out the window. (laughs)

2166
01:21:47.476 --> 01:21:49.393
MATT: That finishes your turn?

2167
01:21:49.393 --> 01:21:51.664
SAM: Yeah, I'll still run and hide on a shelf.

2168
01:21:51.664 --> 01:21:52.716
MATT: Okay.

2169
01:21:52.716 --> 01:21:54.701
Up on here?
MARISHA: Why don't we just recruit her.

2170
01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:56.458
MATT: Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

2171
01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:58.482
SAM: Well, I don't have a bonus action to hide with,

2172
01:21:58.482 --> 01:22:00.869
so I'm just up on a shelf.

2173
01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:01.702
MATT: Okay.

2174
01:22:01.702 --> 01:22:02.895
LAURA: A Nott on a shelf.

2175
01:22:02.895 --> 01:22:04.356
MATT: Okay, it's now her turn.

2176
01:22:04.356 --> 01:22:07.192
She's going to bonus action to disengage,

2177
01:22:07.192 --> 01:22:08.817
and vanish into the floor.

2178
01:22:08.817 --> 01:22:10.747
SAM: Goddamn it!

2179
01:22:10.747 --> 01:22:11.985
MARISHA: Hang on.

2180
01:22:11.985 --> 01:22:13.590
LAURA: Sentinel?

2181
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:15.245
Do you have a reaction, Sentinel?

2182
01:22:15.245 --> 01:22:17.834
MATT: Disengage-- wait, does Sentinel ignore disengage?

2183
01:22:17.834 --> 01:22:19.317
MARISHA: I feel like it does.

2184
01:22:19.317 --> 01:22:20.150
LIAM: It does.

2185
01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:22.260
SAM: Feel like it does.
LIAM: No, it doesn't.

2186
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.993
SAM: I feel like it might.
MARISHA: Let me check.

2187
01:22:23.993 --> 01:22:26.272
TRAVIS: ♪ Sometimes you don't ♪

2188
01:22:28.797 --> 01:22:33.075
SAM: My mom loves Almond Joy and Mounds.

2189
01:22:33.075 --> 01:22:34.388
They're so gross.

2190
01:22:34.388 --> 01:22:37.115
MATT: Sentinel is so obnoxious.

2191
01:22:37.115 --> 01:22:38.683
MARISHA: You bitch!
LAURA: Come on, get her to stay.

2192
01:22:38.683 --> 01:22:41.093
MARISHA: It's just a regular old punchy-punch, right?

2193
01:22:41.093 --> 01:22:42.223
Okay, I'm going to turn around,

2194
01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:45.016
I'm going to do like a big swinging Thai fighter kick,

2195
01:22:45.016 --> 01:22:46.379
just right across her face,

2196
01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.954
to try and get this bitch to stay.

2197
01:22:48.954 --> 01:22:50.304
SAM: Thai fighters kick?

2198
01:22:50.304 --> 01:22:51.514
What movie have I been seeing?

2199
01:22:51.514 --> 01:22:52.561
MARISHA: 17?

2200
01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:53.561
MATT: 17 misses.

2201
01:22:54.743 --> 01:22:55.576
(whooshes)
SAM: Why do we suck?!

2202
01:22:55.576 --> 01:22:57.825
MATT: It goes two inches just above her head

2203
01:22:57.825 --> 01:22:59.526
as she disappears into the floor.

2204
01:22:59.526 --> 01:23:01.956
MARISHA: Telegraphed my attack too much.

2205
01:23:01.956 --> 01:23:03.159
TALIESIN: We are bad at everything.

2206
01:23:03.159 --> 01:23:05.315
MARISHA: That's why they tell the MMA fighters

2207
01:23:05.315 --> 01:23:06.695
never to try that shit.

2208
01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:07.687
TRAVIS: Yep.

2209
01:23:07.687 --> 01:23:10.135
MATT: So for the purposes of brevity,

2210
01:23:10.135 --> 01:23:13.119
you guys prepare your stuff, and a minute goes by,

2211
01:23:13.119 --> 01:23:14.783
and she doesn't appear.

2212
01:23:14.783 --> 01:23:16.979
Two minutes, five minutes of silence,

2213
01:23:16.979 --> 01:23:18.804
and getting ready for certain positions.

2214
01:23:18.804 --> 01:23:19.715
SAM: I fire anyway.

2215
01:23:19.715 --> 01:23:22.485
MATT: You fire, you take a little bit of time.

2216
01:23:22.485 --> 01:23:25.734
TRAVIS: Should we run up and check on Pumat?

2217
01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:28.209
SAM: Yeah, because I want to go check on the Pu.

2218
01:23:28.209 --> 01:23:30.032
TRAVIS: Can I run up and check-- oh, Caleb's up there.

2219
01:23:30.032 --> 01:23:34.372
LIAM: I just back up just a little. Pumat...s? Plural?

2220
01:23:34.372 --> 01:23:37.619
MATT: You see the three of them from upstairs look down,

2221
01:23:37.619 --> 01:23:41.547
"Yeah, we're just taking it easy up here. Everything okay?"

2222
01:23:41.547 --> 01:23:44.325
Pumat's like, "Yeah, no, we got it, don't worry.

2223
01:23:44.325 --> 01:23:47.242
"Scared them off, whatever they were.

2224
01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:49.838
"Well, that doesn't happen every day.

2225
01:23:49.838 --> 01:23:50.695
"Whew!"

2226
01:23:50.695 --> 01:23:54.171
TALIESIN: It kind of does to us, I don't know.

2227
01:23:54.171 --> 01:23:57.107
MATT: "I'm going to make some tea, anybody want any?"

2228
01:23:57.107 --> 01:23:59.449
SAM: Yes!
TALIESIN: Oh, so so much.

2229
01:23:59.449 --> 01:24:02.799
MATT: "I'm going to-- let's put a few pots on, come on.

2230
01:24:02.799 --> 01:24:04.244
"Come on, boys, help me out here."

2231
01:24:04.244 --> 01:24:08.161
LAURA: Can we have tea sitting on the tables, please?

2232
01:24:11.488 --> 01:24:13.740
MATT: So as you guys take a moment.

2233
01:24:14.731 --> 01:24:15.997
MARISHA: I sit on the edge of the counter.

2234
01:24:15.997 --> 01:24:17.430
LAURA: I don't trust it.

2235
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:20.638
I'm not going to feel safe anywhere ever again.

2236
01:24:21.696 --> 01:24:23.651
SAM: That sucked.

2237
01:24:23.651 --> 01:24:25.145
Nothing went right.

2238
01:24:25.145 --> 01:24:25.978
LAURA: Nope.

2239
01:24:27.153 --> 01:24:28.646
MARISHA: It's clear Obann wants us dead.
LAURA: Here's the thing,

2240
01:24:28.646 --> 01:24:31.927
she probably can't be killed right now anyway.

2241
01:24:31.927 --> 01:24:33.294
TALIESIN: I don't know.
SAM: What?

2242
01:24:33.294 --> 01:24:34.443
LAURA: Well, the Laughing Hand couldn't be killed.

2243
01:24:34.443 --> 01:24:35.318
I bet she can't be killed either.

2244
01:24:35.318 --> 01:24:37.649
SAM: How did they know we were here?

2245
01:24:37.649 --> 01:24:39.166
LAURA: Scrying, yo.

2246
01:24:39.166 --> 01:24:41.125
SAM: How do we protect against that?

2247
01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:44.558
MARISHA: Who knows how long they were following us?

2248
01:24:44.558 --> 01:24:46.336
Maybe we just need to watch our backs.

2249
01:24:46.336 --> 01:24:47.169
SAM: Pumat?

2250
01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.977
MATT: Comes back in with one tea set,

2251
01:24:50.977 --> 01:24:53.578
and two of the other come out with two other tea sets,

2252
01:24:53.578 --> 01:24:56.101
says, "Hey, this is about all we got at the moment,

2253
01:24:56.101 --> 01:24:57.626
"but it's warm."

2254
01:24:57.626 --> 01:24:59.633
SAM: Is there anything that you make or sell

2255
01:24:59.633 --> 01:25:02.470
that can protect us from Scrying eyes?

2256
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:04.305
MATT: "Well, I mean, yeah, I can make some things

2257
01:25:04.305 --> 01:25:05.961
"that can make ya undetectable.

2258
01:25:05.961 --> 01:25:09.541
"I'm going to need a few weeks per implement to produce."

2259
01:25:09.541 --> 01:25:10.621
SAM: Per implement?

2260
01:25:10.621 --> 01:25:13.236
You can't make them simultaneously and sort of like--

2261
01:25:13.236 --> 01:25:14.640
MATT: "Well, it only takes me that short a period of time

2262
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.083
"because all four of us are working on it."

2263
01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:17.583
SAM: Oh, okay.
TRAVIS: Wow.

2264
01:25:19.883 --> 01:25:21.646
MATT: "I can't just turn around too fast here,

2265
01:25:21.646 --> 01:25:24.273
"it's a finely crafted art form."

2266
01:25:24.273 --> 01:25:25.462
LAURA: Yeah, that sounds--

2267
01:25:25.462 --> 01:25:28.084
MATT: "Oh here," just pouring everyone cups of tea

2268
01:25:28.084 --> 01:25:29.544
in the center of the chamber.

2269
01:25:29.544 --> 01:25:31.344
As he's doing that, Pumat goes, "So, uh...

2270
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.463
"what ha-- why?

2271
01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:35.555
"Who was that?

2272
01:25:35.555 --> 01:25:38.557
"What'd you do, where'd they go? What's, uh--"

2273
01:25:38.557 --> 01:25:41.062
TRAVIS: We found ourselves in the attention

2274
01:25:41.062 --> 01:25:45.214
of some rather terrible people since we last saw you.

2275
01:25:45.214 --> 01:25:46.047
MATT: "Apparently."

2276
01:25:46.047 --> 01:25:48.808
TRAVIS: Apparently, they've become a bit aggressive

2277
01:25:48.808 --> 01:25:52.512
with their plans to even the scales.

2278
01:25:52.512 --> 01:25:56.352
LAURA: Have you ever heard of the Chained Oblivion?

2279
01:25:56.352 --> 01:26:00.136
MATT: "(laughs) Wait, are you serious?"

2280
01:26:00.136 --> 01:26:02.484
TRAVIS: 'Fraid so.
TALIESIN: She's serious, yeah.

2281
01:26:02.484 --> 01:26:05.337
SAM: Doesn't she look serious?

2282
01:26:05.337 --> 01:26:10.337
MATT: "So wait, this person's involved
with that Tharizdun fella?"

2283
01:26:10.943 --> 01:26:12.470
LIAM: Apparently.

2284
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:14.044
MATT: "That's real bad.

2285
01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:16.914
"And they know where I work now."

2286
01:26:16.914 --> 01:26:18.283
TALIESIN: Well--
LAURA: Well--

2287
01:26:18.283 --> 01:26:19.992
MARISHA: I think they were after us.

2288
01:26:19.992 --> 01:26:22.934
SAM: Should we burn down the store, start afresh?

2289
01:26:24.384 --> 01:26:25.737
MATT: "I like where you're going with that,

2290
01:26:25.737 --> 01:26:30.311
"but I think that should be a very last-case scenario."

2291
01:26:30.311 --> 01:26:33.053
LIAM: Caleb kills the flame in his hand.

2292
01:26:33.053 --> 01:26:35.459
SAM: (laughs) He was about to--

2293
01:26:35.459 --> 01:26:37.075
MATT: "Anyway, ah--"

2294
01:26:37.075 --> 01:26:40.146
TRAVIS: Pumat, you don't happen to have any secrets,

2295
01:26:40.146 --> 01:26:43.286
arcane items, relics, that perhaps you have stowed away

2296
01:26:43.286 --> 01:26:44.752
in your room, in your back office

2297
01:26:44.752 --> 01:26:46.604
that you don't have out on display,

2298
01:26:46.604 --> 01:26:48.060
anything that might've drawn the attention

2299
01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.143
of someone like this?

2300
01:26:49.143 --> 01:26:51.959
Only looking out for your wellbeing.

2301
01:26:51.959 --> 01:26:55.286
LIAM: Because it's either us, or some--

2302
01:26:55.286 --> 01:26:58.194
TRAVIS: They were coming for us,
or something you might have?

2303
01:26:58.194 --> 01:27:01.024
MATT: "I can't imagine, they didn't really come after me."

2304
01:27:01.024 --> 01:27:02.835
MARISHA: Yeah, if the goal was to get in and out,

2305
01:27:02.835 --> 01:27:04.143
why would you do it at a time

2306
01:27:04.143 --> 01:27:07.082
where you have to fight seven, eight other people?

2307
01:27:07.082 --> 01:27:09.492
MATT: "Well, besides that fact,
most of the stuff that I have right now

2308
01:27:09.492 --> 01:27:11.092
"that hasn't already been shipped off

2309
01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:13.107
"to Assembly's requirements

2310
01:27:13.107 --> 01:27:15.356
"are the things that I keep on myself to keep me safe,

2311
01:27:15.356 --> 01:27:19.023
"and I want to hold onto those right now.

2312
01:27:20.094 --> 01:27:22.427
"What are you planning to do?"

2313
01:27:23.275 --> 01:27:26.021
SAM: We have no fucking idea.

2314
01:27:26.021 --> 01:27:27.700
TRAVIS: If you were to trace someone

2315
01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.543
that could fall through the floor,

2316
01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:31.934
I know what we would do,

2317
01:27:31.934 --> 01:27:33.810
w-w-what would you do?

2318
01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:35.165
TALIESIN: What would we do?

2319
01:27:35.165 --> 01:27:37.463
MATT: "I'd probably scry on 'em."

2320
01:27:37.463 --> 01:27:39.764
LAURA: That sounds really smart.

2321
01:27:39.764 --> 01:27:41.435
SAM: So we're going to <i>them</i>?

2322
01:27:41.435 --> 01:27:44.230
LIAM: That is correct, we have to find them.

2323
01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:45.775
Because it is only a matter of time

2324
01:27:45.775 --> 01:27:47.988
before this happens again, and I hate to tell you all,

2325
01:27:47.988 --> 01:27:50.748
but we are back to camping together indoors and out,

2326
01:27:50.748 --> 01:27:51.860
and back on watch.

2327
01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:53.687
MATT: "Is it just this one person?"

2328
01:27:53.687 --> 01:27:54.604
ALL: No.

2329
01:27:55.546 --> 01:27:57.421
MATT: "Oh, okay."
SAM: There's four assassins,

2330
01:27:57.421 --> 01:27:58.955
and they're all super powerful.

2331
01:27:58.955 --> 01:28:01.005
LAURA: There's Yasha, who you met before.

2332
01:28:01.005 --> 01:28:02.842
She's the really tall girl.

2333
01:28:02.842 --> 01:28:04.383
MATT: "Wait, Yasha's working with--"

2334
01:28:04.383 --> 01:28:05.626
LAURA: Not intentionally.

2335
01:28:05.626 --> 01:28:07.002
She's being trapped.

2336
01:28:07.002 --> 01:28:08.737
SAM: She might have been evil the whole time,

2337
01:28:08.737 --> 01:28:10.012
we just didn't know.
LAURA: No, she's not.

2338
01:28:10.012 --> 01:28:12.773
She's good, and she's being mind-controlled.

2339
01:28:12.773 --> 01:28:14.423
MARISHA: She had amnesia, she didn't know.

2340
01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:16.188
MATT: "She's being mind-controlled?"

2341
01:28:16.188 --> 01:28:17.187
LAURA: Yeah.

2342
01:28:17.187 --> 01:28:18.492
MATT: "Huh.

2343
01:28:18.492 --> 01:28:21.302
"See, that there is usually some...

2344
01:28:21.302 --> 01:28:23.903
that's some of the magic that I can dabble in.

2345
01:28:23.903 --> 01:28:26.264
"I don't choose to, but it's similar realms

2346
01:28:26.264 --> 01:28:27.739
"of arcane specialties."

2347
01:28:27.739 --> 01:28:30.299
LAURA: Have you heard of a thing on the back of the neck?

2348
01:28:30.299 --> 01:28:34.791
Something that glows, I can't remember the color.

2349
01:28:34.791 --> 01:28:37.385
Was it red, was it glowing red?

2350
01:28:37.385 --> 01:28:38.841
I don't know.

2351
01:28:38.841 --> 01:28:40.291
I can't remember, as Jester, I can't remember.

2352
01:28:40.291 --> 01:28:42.058
SAM: I think it was orange.
LAURA: Orange?

2353
01:28:42.058 --> 01:28:43.439
MATT: It was kind of like an orange,

2354
01:28:43.439 --> 01:28:46.939
it looked almost like a cigarette lighter.

2355
01:28:48.689 --> 01:28:50.746
"I mean, or you can draw it for me,"

2356
01:28:50.746 --> 01:28:52.570
and he pulls out a little thing.

2357
01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:55.853
LAURA: I will draw you a really good depiction of it.

2358
01:28:55.853 --> 01:28:57.039
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

2359
01:28:57.039 --> 01:28:58.509
LAURA: Oh man!

2360
01:28:58.509 --> 01:28:59.923
MATT: (laughs)

2361
01:28:59.923 --> 01:29:01.711
LAURA: I'm scared to roll tonight.

2362
01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:03.456
TALIESIN: No, you're out of combat, it's going to be fine.

2363
01:29:03.456 --> 01:29:04.530
LAURA: No, it won't.

2364
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:05.864
TALIESIN: No, it won't.

2365
01:29:05.864 --> 01:29:09.150
LAURA: Everything's bad, the whole world sucks.

2366
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:12.005
SAM: I bless you.
LAURA: I already rolled it.

2367
01:29:12.005 --> 01:29:14.711
MATT: What'd you get?
LAURA: I rolled a six.

2368
01:29:14.711 --> 01:29:16.333
MATT: Aw.

2369
01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:18.296
So Pumat can't-- he looks at it,

2370
01:29:18.296 --> 01:29:22.186
He goes, "Ah, not sure particularly what this is.

2371
01:29:22.186 --> 01:29:24.079
"It's definitely a glyph,

2372
01:29:24.079 --> 01:29:26.008
"but if it's some sort of mind control thing,

2373
01:29:26.008 --> 01:29:28.561
"then there are limitations to that kind of enchantment.

2374
01:29:28.561 --> 01:29:31.451
"How long has she been under this individual's influence?"

2375
01:29:31.451 --> 01:29:32.784
SAM: Weeks, months.

2376
01:29:33.854 --> 01:29:35.854
MATT: "Oh, that's a powerful one."

2377
01:29:36.906 --> 01:29:39.408
SAM: Can it be dispelled with some sort of spell?

2378
01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:42.084
MATT: "Most magic can be dispelled."

2379
01:29:42.084 --> 01:29:44.920
LAURA: He's using it on multiple people.

2380
01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.463
MATT: "Wait, multiple people?"

2381
01:29:46.463 --> 01:29:47.984
TRAVIS: He's also working with a creature

2382
01:29:47.984 --> 01:29:50.591
called the Laughing Hand.

2383
01:29:50.591 --> 01:29:53.036
MARISHA: Big, blobby, terrible-looking thing.

2384
01:29:53.036 --> 01:29:54.788
MATT: "That sounds real bad. Not a fan of it."

2385
01:29:54.788 --> 01:29:56.963
LAURA: He's got like a giant blade on his arm,

2386
01:29:56.963 --> 01:29:58.879
and he's got a lot of mouths all over him.

2387
01:29:58.879 --> 01:29:59.853
TALIESIN: Covered in mouths.

2388
01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:02.957
MATT: "Wow, that's a delightful image."

2389
01:30:02.957 --> 01:30:05.706
LAURA: Then this chick that you just saw,

2390
01:30:05.706 --> 01:30:09.205
and then the main guy's like, he's a devil,

2391
01:30:09.205 --> 01:30:11.158
and he's got wings.
TRAVIS: His name's Obann.

2392
01:30:11.158 --> 01:30:13.834
MATT: "So they're all controlling this Yasha girl?"

2393
01:30:13.834 --> 01:30:16.381
SAM: Obann is controlling all of them?

2394
01:30:16.381 --> 01:30:17.700
TRAVIS: Well, at least not Yasha.

2395
01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.242
TALIESIN: Obann's got something maybe on all of them.

2396
01:30:19.242 --> 01:30:21.183
MATT: "Well, maybe there's a chance

2397
01:30:21.183 --> 01:30:22.907
"at dispelling or getting rid of it,

2398
01:30:22.907 --> 01:30:25.958
"but you probably got to be able to see it to do that."

2399
01:30:25.958 --> 01:30:27.754
LAURA: That sounds promising.

2400
01:30:27.754 --> 01:30:31.396
TRAVIS: Don't happen to have any, um,
dispelling stones, do you?

2401
01:30:31.396 --> 01:30:34.350
LAURA: We had one, but Fjord used it.

2402
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:37.100
SAM: Effectively.
MATT: Well, how many of you guys can dispel?

2403
01:30:38.443 --> 01:30:39.609
SAM: Okay.
MATT: "All right,

2404
01:30:39.609 --> 01:30:44.609
"you guys have some sound opportunities there.

2405
01:30:44.844 --> 01:30:46.093
"That might work."

2406
01:30:46.093 --> 01:30:50.051
SAM: Maybe we should find Yasha and try to get her out.

2407
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:54.709
Like a stealth-- like <i>we</i> go on the offensive, we try--

2408
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:57.063
LAURA: We just, all of us, all at once,

2409
01:30:57.063 --> 01:30:59.260
hit three dispels on her.

2410
01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.990
SAM: Yeah, get out while they're sleeping.

2411
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.655
LIAM: Change the odds, get her back.

2412
01:31:04.655 --> 01:31:07.101
MARISHA: Do you think the rest of them are in the city?

2413
01:31:07.101 --> 01:31:08.991
Do you think they're in Zadash?

2414
01:31:08.991 --> 01:31:11.732
LAURA: I will definitely be able to scry.

2415
01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.215
SAM: Scry on that shit.

2416
01:31:13.215 --> 01:31:16.191
LAURA: Well, I used both my 5th-levels on booping.

2417
01:31:16.191 --> 01:31:20.775
SAM: Pumat, how's your Scry?
TRAVIS: (laughs) "On booping"!

2418
01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:24.568
MATT: "Well, I mean, I don't really have it prepared,

2419
01:31:24.568 --> 01:31:25.984
"I don't have to usually do that,

2420
01:31:25.984 --> 01:31:28.010
"but with a night's rest, I can probably go ahead

2421
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:29.914
"and get that situated.

2422
01:31:29.914 --> 01:31:31.762
"If you're looking for information to follow folks,

2423
01:31:31.762 --> 01:31:34.569
"you should probably double up on as many

2424
01:31:34.569 --> 01:31:37.277
"any distant eye-peering as we can."

2425
01:31:37.277 --> 01:31:40.268
TRAVIS: Yeah, yes, yep.

2426
01:31:40.268 --> 01:31:41.890
Double up.

2427
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:43.457
TALIESIN: That's smart.

2428
01:31:43.457 --> 01:31:46.284
MARISHA: Why don't we go into the back room or upstairs,

2429
01:31:46.284 --> 01:31:50.828
somewhere a little bit not in the front of the store?

2430
01:31:50.828 --> 01:31:52.146
MATT: "Yeah, yeah.

2431
01:31:52.146 --> 01:31:54.127
"Pumats, go ahead and close up and lock up,

2432
01:31:54.127 --> 01:31:55.353
"we're going to go ahead and head into

2433
01:31:55.353 --> 01:31:57.663
"the Ye Olde Enchantment Chamber."

2434
01:31:57.663 --> 01:31:59.127
SAM: Ooh, is that what it's really called?

2435
01:31:59.127 --> 01:32:00.619
MATT: "Well, it's what I call it,
that's what I call my bedroom."

2436
01:32:00.619 --> 01:32:02.637
SAM: Oh. (laughs)

2437
01:32:02.637 --> 01:32:04.887
LIAM: Ooh, we get to see his comic book collection.

2438
01:32:07.303 --> 01:32:09.586
TRAVIS: He's got like 200 Marvel comics.

2439
01:32:09.586 --> 01:32:11.324
(laughter)

2440
01:32:11.324 --> 01:32:12.604
MATT: So he leads you into the back chamber.

2441
01:32:12.604 --> 01:32:14.181
SAM: Ooh, cool CD tower.

2442
01:32:14.181 --> 01:32:16.145
(laughter)

2443
01:32:16.145 --> 01:32:19.193
MATT: "Oh, you haven't even seen
the laser disc section yet."

2444
01:32:19.193 --> 01:32:22.110
SAM: Great, Tribe Called Quest, awesome!

2445
01:32:23.361 --> 01:32:26.616
MATT: "I see you're a goblin of taste."

2446
01:32:26.616 --> 01:32:28.768
So leads you into the back room, it's cluttered,

2447
01:32:28.768 --> 01:32:30.958
like ceiling-to-floor.

2448
01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:32.872
Everything is organized, it doesn't look like

2449
01:32:32.872 --> 01:32:35.805
it's a hoarder's chamber, by any means,

2450
01:32:35.805 --> 01:32:38.049
but every bit of space is used.

2451
01:32:38.049 --> 01:32:39.952
You can see there's a table arranged

2452
01:32:39.952 --> 01:32:44.424
with a whole bunch of clamps and small arcane devices

2453
01:32:44.424 --> 01:32:46.386
that are used in the process of enchanting

2454
01:32:46.386 --> 01:32:47.869
different types of materials and items.

2455
01:32:47.869 --> 01:32:50.354
You can see there's small clusters of things

2456
01:32:50.354 --> 01:32:52.112
that are used in that process,

2457
01:32:52.112 --> 01:32:55.253
both to be in the trigger, and inscribe

2458
01:32:55.253 --> 01:32:57.556
and permanently create these rituals

2459
01:32:57.556 --> 01:33:00.690
that produce these items over time.

2460
01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:02.418
But you guys all get in the back room,

2461
01:33:02.418 --> 01:33:05.265
and closes the curtain, and is like,

2462
01:33:05.265 --> 01:33:07.841
"All right, so what're we doing here now?"

2463
01:33:07.841 --> 01:33:10.881
TRAVIS: Detect Magic-- no. (laughs)
SAM: See Invisibility.

2464
01:33:10.881 --> 01:33:12.214
MARISHA: Ah, I'm blind!

2465
01:33:13.059 --> 01:33:15.908
SAM: Well, we can't scry, right? Mr. Ducey, you can't--?

2466
01:33:15.908 --> 01:33:17.937
TALIESIN: Not right now.

2467
01:33:17.937 --> 01:33:19.557
LIAM: So nobody can do that right now.

2468
01:33:19.557 --> 01:33:21.875
LAURA: We could all go to sleep, I guess.
SAM: What time is it?

2469
01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:24.004
Did we come in here in the morning?

2470
01:33:24.004 --> 01:33:26.792
MATT: It's like midday, like early afternoon.

2471
01:33:26.792 --> 01:33:29.090
LAURA: I think we should definitely take a rest, right?

2472
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:30.620
Is everybody hurt?

2473
01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.474
LIAM: I would like to rest, but I don't know if the Pumats

2474
01:33:32.474 --> 01:33:36.934
would want us to invite further danger here.

2475
01:33:36.934 --> 01:33:39.116
MATT: "I think it might be best if we maybe sleep

2476
01:33:39.116 --> 01:33:41.604
"in different places.

2477
01:33:41.604 --> 01:33:44.472
"If they're going after you guys specifically,

2478
01:33:44.472 --> 01:33:46.489
"yeah, I mean, respectfully,

2479
01:33:46.489 --> 01:33:49.449
"maybe not be sleeping so close."

2480
01:33:49.449 --> 01:33:54.145
LAURA: Are there four beds in here, or is there one big bed?

2481
01:33:54.145 --> 01:33:55.517
MATT: There's one bed, and he says,

2482
01:33:55.517 --> 01:33:58.062
"Oh, the simulacrums sleep upstairs."

2483
01:33:58.062 --> 01:33:59.434
LAURA: So they do sleep.

2484
01:33:59.434 --> 01:34:02.501
MARISHA: We could also sleep at the Soul.
I've got my room at the Soul.

2485
01:34:02.501 --> 01:34:04.059
TALIESIN: They already gotten in there before, though.

2486
01:34:04.059 --> 01:34:06.117
SAM: We could sleep at The Gentleman's.

2487
01:34:06.117 --> 01:34:06.955
LIAM: They can get in anywhere.

2488
01:34:06.955 --> 01:34:09.400
TRAVIS: Aside from the crafting materials,

2489
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.135
is there anything on the walls that just stick out

2490
01:34:12.135 --> 01:34:15.551
as particularly crazy or interesting?

2491
01:34:15.551 --> 01:34:18.134
Or rare?
MATT: Make a perception check.

2492
01:34:20.387 --> 01:34:21.560
TRAVIS: Ah, 12.

2493
01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.911
MATT: 12? Looking around, you have no idea

2494
01:34:23.911 --> 01:34:25.564
what most of this does.

2495
01:34:25.564 --> 01:34:29.001
A lot of it's just odd canisters that are labeled,

2496
01:34:29.001 --> 01:34:30.733
but the labels have been rubbed off over time,

2497
01:34:30.733 --> 01:34:32.148
and just at a glance, you can't really read them

2498
01:34:32.148 --> 01:34:34.156
from this distance.

2499
01:34:34.156 --> 01:34:38.408
You can see that there's some pouches and things

2500
01:34:38.408 --> 01:34:39.879
that look like they could contain elements,

2501
01:34:39.879 --> 01:34:41.097
but you can't really see what they are.

2502
01:34:41.097 --> 01:34:43.357
TRAVIS: No stick on the wall that says
"Kill Stick" or anything?

2503
01:34:43.357 --> 01:34:44.838
MATT: No.

2504
01:34:44.838 --> 01:34:46.820
You gather there's probably quite a lot of worth

2505
01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:48.329
in this room in just raw materials

2506
01:34:48.329 --> 01:34:51.819
that allow these enchantments to be inscribed,

2507
01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:54.901
but you have no real knowledge of specifically

2508
01:34:54.901 --> 01:34:56.484
what anything does in here.

2509
01:34:56.484 --> 01:35:01.484
SAM: Caleb, should we offer to compensate the Sols

2510
01:35:01.549 --> 01:35:05.049
for the damage and trouble we caused them?

2511
01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.759
LIAM: Yes, that seems fair.

2512
01:35:09.759 --> 01:35:13.463
Can we help you make up for any problems

2513
01:35:13.463 --> 01:35:14.721
we've caused for you,

2514
01:35:14.721 --> 01:35:17.112
at least the grease?
MATT: "That's easy to clean up.

2515
01:35:17.112 --> 01:35:20.154
"I mean, it's not like you burned it down or anything."

2516
01:35:20.154 --> 01:35:22.450
LIAM: Well, there is a bit of acid on the floor.

2517
01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:23.687
MATT: "Ah, that's mine."

2518
01:35:23.687 --> 01:35:25.458
LAURA: No, the grease is gone, don't worry about it.

2519
01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:26.815
SAM: It just evaporated?

2520
01:35:26.815 --> 01:35:28.477
MATT: "You know what, it gives it character.

2521
01:35:28.477 --> 01:35:30.069
"Don't worry about it.

2522
01:35:30.069 --> 01:35:31.629
"I can just move the rug over a little bit,

2523
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:33.794
"and no one will be any the wiser."

2524
01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:36.202
TALIESIN: It's a good rug. Really ties the room together.

2525
01:35:36.202 --> 01:35:38.550
MATT: "Well, thank you, I appreciate that."

2526
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:39.805
LAURA: Hey, Pumat?
MATT: "Yeah?"

2527
01:35:39.805 --> 01:35:42.204
LAURA: How much for this shield that I'm using?

2528
01:35:45.387 --> 01:35:48.369
MATT: "You're going after this Chained Oblivion, right?"

2529
01:35:48.369 --> 01:35:50.036
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: 5,000 gold.

2530
01:35:50.924 --> 01:35:52.380
MATT: "Go ahead and take it."

2531
01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:53.434
MARISHA: Yeah!

2532
01:35:53.434 --> 01:35:54.684
LAURA: Really?

2533
01:35:56.443 --> 01:35:59.575
(whispering) Oh my gosh, what does it look like?

2534
01:35:59.575 --> 01:36:04.575
MATT: You look at it, it has a red leather inlay

2535
01:36:04.575 --> 01:36:07.353
over the top of it, and there's a bunch of these brass studs

2536
01:36:07.353 --> 01:36:09.239
that poke through.

2537
01:36:09.239 --> 01:36:12.834
It doesn't look extremely detailed, but it's pretty,

2538
01:36:12.834 --> 01:36:16.481
and aside from you holding it,

2539
01:36:16.481 --> 01:36:17.727
has not seen any combat use,

2540
01:36:17.727 --> 01:36:20.113
so it could very well look on a wall.

2541
01:36:20.113 --> 01:36:22.650
LAURA: I run over and give him a hug.

2542
01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:24.004
Thank you so much.

2543
01:36:24.004 --> 01:36:27.797
MATT: "Oh, least I can do you, kept me safe.

2544
01:36:27.797 --> 01:36:29.331
"I mean, you brought it here,

2545
01:36:29.331 --> 01:36:32.498
"so yeah, it all comes out in the wash."

2546
01:36:35.884 --> 01:36:37.429
TRAVIS: All right.
MATT: "Well, here.

2547
01:36:37.429 --> 01:36:40.030
"Yeah, go ahead and get your rest about you,

2548
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:41.142
"maybe come on by tomorrow,

2549
01:36:41.142 --> 01:36:44.690
"and we'll all see if we can find a quiet space here,

2550
01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:48.512
"maybe not in the middle of the chamber,

2551
01:36:48.512 --> 01:36:50.724
"and see if we can ascertain any information

2552
01:36:50.724 --> 01:36:54.016
"about where this figure, or the others, might be."

2553
01:36:54.016 --> 01:36:57.701
LIAM: So we are not taking a sit down and rest here?

2554
01:36:57.701 --> 01:36:59.046
LAURA: No, somewhere else.

2555
01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.743
So we don't draw attention to him.

2556
01:37:00.743 --> 01:37:02.682
TALIESIN: But a short rest here, but a long rest

2557
01:37:02.682 --> 01:37:03.896
somewhere else, right?

2558
01:37:03.896 --> 01:37:06.089
We do need an hour to just--
LIAM: Do different things.

2559
01:37:06.089 --> 01:37:07.044
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2560
01:37:07.044 --> 01:37:10.211
SAM: Doing a short rest, not here, right?

2561
01:37:11.118 --> 01:37:12.359
LAURA: Oh my god.

2562
01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:13.913
Oh my god.

2563
01:37:13.913 --> 01:37:16.140
I think he said we should leave.

2564
01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.533
SAM: Okay, so we'll stay here for an hour?

2565
01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:21.533
MATT: "Yeah, oh, that's fine."

2566
01:37:22.884 --> 01:37:25.711
He reaches under the table into a little box

2567
01:37:25.711 --> 01:37:27.385
and pulls something out and affixes it

2568
01:37:27.385 --> 01:37:29.737
onto the front of his robe.

2569
01:37:29.737 --> 01:37:31.301
"I'll just stay in here.

2570
01:37:31.301 --> 01:37:33.315
"Just do it on the other side of the room."

2571
01:37:33.315 --> 01:37:34.448
TRAVIS: Oh, no problem.

2572
01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:36.709
MATT: You recognize the brooch specifically,

2573
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:39.459
it's similar to the one you have.

2574
01:37:40.357 --> 01:37:43.019
TALIESIN: Let's-- just-- because I'm a little nervous

2575
01:37:43.019 --> 01:37:45.713
walking out this door if we're not at full health.

2576
01:37:45.713 --> 01:37:49.340
LAURA: Everybody keep their backs to walls.

2577
01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:51.495
LIAM: If we have just freeloaded our way

2578
01:37:51.495 --> 01:37:53.703
into a short rest here, I'm going to do Arcane Recovery.

2579
01:37:53.703 --> 01:37:55.063
MATT: Take a short rest if you'd like.

2580
01:37:55.063 --> 01:37:56.770
TRAVIS: Short rest it is.

2581
01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:59.520
MARISHA: Six plus eight is 14.

2582
01:38:01.788 --> 01:38:02.621
Three.

2583
01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:09.782
LIAM: We're quiet.

2584
01:38:11.016 --> 01:38:12.114
Too quiet.

2585
01:38:12.114 --> 01:38:14.339
(whooshes)
LAURA: (gags)

2586
01:38:17.117 --> 01:38:18.117
MATT: All right.

2587
01:38:19.997 --> 01:38:23.230
After you finish your short rest, what would you like to do?

2588
01:38:25.266 --> 01:38:30.249
LIAM: We need to give the Pumats their space, so

2589
01:38:33.232 --> 01:38:35.174
let's go somewhere and decide what we want to do.

2590
01:38:35.174 --> 01:38:38.424
We could do that over a drink, perhaps.

2591
01:38:39.279 --> 01:38:42.942
TRAVIS: Jester, you said you had wanted to, perhaps,

2592
01:38:42.942 --> 01:38:44.273
speak with The Gentleman.

2593
01:38:44.273 --> 01:38:45.458
SAM: It's a safe place to go.

2594
01:38:45.458 --> 01:38:49.609
TRAVIS: Also a place of beverages and revelry.

2595
01:38:49.609 --> 01:38:51.879
LIAM: Tucked away from prying eyes.

2596
01:38:51.879 --> 01:38:53.938
SAM: He may know some information.

2597
01:38:53.938 --> 01:38:55.448
TRAVIS: I doubt she'll want to jump in

2598
01:38:55.448 --> 01:38:58.822
and try and stabby stab in The Gentleman's place.

2599
01:38:58.822 --> 01:39:00.181
LAURA: I mean, probably not.

2600
01:39:00.181 --> 01:39:03.021
We have to be super careful on the way there, though, yeah?

2601
01:39:03.021 --> 01:39:07.703
LIAM: Also, that seems like quite a lot, that was a lot,

2602
01:39:07.703 --> 01:39:10.787
and going there could be a lot.

2603
01:39:10.787 --> 01:39:12.530
You ready for that?

2604
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:13.780
LAURA: Well, I mean,

2605
01:39:15.638 --> 01:39:17.865
You know, I've already seen him before,

2606
01:39:17.865 --> 01:39:21.401
so it's not like that's the first time ever.

2607
01:39:21.401 --> 01:39:23.277
LIAM: Well, but sometimes thinking about something

2608
01:39:23.277 --> 01:39:27.645
and then the moment, they're two different things.

2609
01:39:27.645 --> 01:39:29.377
LAURA: That's true.

2610
01:39:29.377 --> 01:39:31.971
I think just pull the bandaid right off,

2611
01:39:31.971 --> 01:39:34.273
just go and see him.

2612
01:39:34.273 --> 01:39:36.112
MARISHA: You're going to call him Dad, like,

2613
01:39:36.112 --> 01:39:37.665
as soon as we get there, aren't we?

2614
01:39:37.665 --> 01:39:40.064
TRAVIS: Yeah, what would you say?

2615
01:39:40.064 --> 01:39:43.392
LAURA: Oh, hey Dad.

2616
01:39:43.392 --> 01:39:44.762
It's good to see you again,

2617
01:39:44.762 --> 01:39:49.161
so glad that I'm here now, we can be a good family.

2618
01:39:49.161 --> 01:39:50.709
Is there anything you want to say to me,

2619
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:52.230
since it's been a long time?

2620
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:54.722
SAM: You're not my daughter, I don't know who you are.

2621
01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:58.113
I'm just setting you up for the worst, for the worst!

2622
01:39:58.113 --> 01:40:01.119
So you don't have this reaction when you see him!

2623
01:40:01.119 --> 01:40:02.708
LAURA: (tearfully) He's not going to say that!

2624
01:40:02.708 --> 01:40:03.991
SAM: I disavow you,

2625
01:40:03.991 --> 01:40:05.855
you're not related to me.
LAURA: No, he's not going to say that!

2626
01:40:05.855 --> 01:40:07.075
SAM: Well, I'm just setting you up

2627
01:40:07.075 --> 01:40:10.586
so that you don't do that when you see him.

2628
01:40:10.586 --> 01:40:13.531
MARISHA: It is good to role-play scenarios.

2629
01:40:13.531 --> 01:40:15.686
LAURA: I'm going to, if he says that,

2630
01:40:15.686 --> 01:40:19.908
I'll just say: (tearfully) Well, okay then, I guess I'll go.

2631
01:40:19.908 --> 01:40:20.876
What should I say?

2632
01:40:20.876 --> 01:40:23.343
SAM: I don't know, I have never been in this situation.

2633
01:40:23.343 --> 01:40:24.676
MARISHA: I think maybe, you know,

2634
01:40:27.603 --> 01:40:31.770
a man like The Gentleman seems like

2635
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:35.058
he might have commitment issues,

2636
01:40:35.058 --> 01:40:39.542
and if you want to eventually build a relationship with him,

2637
01:40:39.542 --> 01:40:44.141
you might want to do it slowly over time.

2638
01:40:44.141 --> 01:40:47.074
TALIESIN: That was really good advice.

2639
01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.343
SAM: You have a pretty good
relationship with your dad, right?

2640
01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:51.010
MARISHA: Yeah, it's what I attempted, and it failed,

2641
01:40:51.010 --> 01:40:52.753
so I don't know.

2642
01:40:52.753 --> 01:40:55.663
LAURA: I'm just going to go in there as my mom.

2643
01:40:55.663 --> 01:40:58.413
MARISHA: Oh, that's--
SAM: Ooh, I don't know.

2644
01:40:58.413 --> 01:41:00.995
MARISHA: That seems the opposite--

2645
01:41:00.995 --> 01:41:02.376
SAM: Missed me on that one.

2646
01:41:02.376 --> 01:41:05.310
LAURA: Here's the thing: He doesn't know I'm in the city,

2647
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:07.320
and if I go in there as my mom,

2648
01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.278
and he doesn't recognize her, then

2649
01:41:11.278 --> 01:41:13.104
he's not my dad.

2650
01:41:13.104 --> 01:41:14.855
But if I go in there as my mom, and he's like,

2651
01:41:14.855 --> 01:41:16.960
"Oh my god."
TALIESIN: I don't know if tricking your father

2652
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.050
into a relationship with you is the best.

2653
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:20.805
LAURA: "I'm sorry I left you when you were pregnant."

2654
01:41:20.805 --> 01:41:22.500
LIAM: Let's play a game, though.

2655
01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.333
Talk like your mother.

2656
01:41:25.537 --> 01:41:26.825
LAURA: Oh, I do that all the time.

2657
01:41:26.825 --> 01:41:28.158
LIAM and TALIESIN: Let's hear it.

2658
01:41:31.907 --> 01:41:34.607
LAURA: (like Marion) Babenon, it's so good to see you,

2659
01:41:34.607 --> 01:41:36.729
it's been so long.

2660
01:41:36.729 --> 01:41:40.479
I've missed you so much, my dearest.

2661
01:41:40.479 --> 01:41:41.906
TRAVIS: It's pretty good, actually.

2662
01:41:41.906 --> 01:41:43.481
LIAM: She's almost as good as me.

2663
01:41:43.481 --> 01:41:44.889
MARISHA: No, we're missing the point

2664
01:41:44.889 --> 01:41:47.329
that this is a bad idea, though.

2665
01:41:47.329 --> 01:41:50.814
TRAVIS: Actually, doesn't he have vials of our blood

2666
01:41:50.814 --> 01:41:54.729
that give him the ability to know that we are here now?

2667
01:41:54.729 --> 01:41:56.659
LAURA: Only if he is actively looking,

2668
01:41:56.659 --> 01:41:59.416
it's not like he's got them on little dingers or something.

2669
01:41:59.416 --> 01:42:00.989
TRAVIS: What if he's assigned someone to tracking

2670
01:42:00.989 --> 01:42:04.002
all the vials of blood?
MARISHA: Okay, are we still missing

2671
01:42:04.002 --> 01:42:06.278
the overall point that you can't trick your dad

2672
01:42:06.278 --> 01:42:08.924
into a relationship by pretending to be your mom?

2673
01:42:08.924 --> 01:42:10.314
LIAM: Well, I think what Jester is going--

2674
01:42:10.314 --> 01:42:14.681
LAURA: I'm going to find out if he actually is my dad.

2675
01:42:14.681 --> 01:42:16.048
Here's the thing, I'm going to be honest

2676
01:42:16.048 --> 01:42:17.584
with you guys, okay?

2677
01:42:17.584 --> 01:42:19.775
SAM: But not with him. You're going to be
honest with us, but not with him.

2678
01:42:19.775 --> 01:42:21.495
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.
SAM: Okay, cool, cool.

2679
01:42:21.495 --> 01:42:23.199
MARISHA: Are we going to have to
watch you flirt with your dad?

2680
01:42:23.199 --> 01:42:24.091
LAURA: No!

2681
01:42:24.091 --> 01:42:27.456
It's really just to see this initial reaction,

2682
01:42:27.456 --> 01:42:29.305
because here's the thing,

2683
01:42:29.305 --> 01:42:31.389
every time I told him he's my dad,

2684
01:42:31.389 --> 01:42:33.642
every time I've talked to him, I was lying,

2685
01:42:33.642 --> 01:42:36.192
he doesn't actually say, "Oh my gosh, Jester,

2686
01:42:36.192 --> 01:42:38.674
"please come see me," he doesn't say that.

2687
01:42:38.674 --> 01:42:39.782
SAM: What does he say?

2688
01:42:39.782 --> 01:42:42.889
LAURA: He says, "You're not my daughter,

2689
01:42:42.889 --> 01:42:47.139
"I don't know who you are, you've got the wrong guy."

2690
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:51.202
TALIESIN: You were surprisingly accurate, actually, then.

2691
01:42:51.202 --> 01:42:53.452
SAM: Well, I'm sorry for that.

2692
01:42:56.051 --> 01:42:58.066
LIAM: A couple of variations on your plan,

2693
01:42:58.066 --> 01:42:59.703
not saying not to do your plan,

2694
01:42:59.703 --> 01:43:04.004
but you could paint a picture and show it to him

2695
01:43:04.004 --> 01:43:09.004
to see if the response, or you could have Fjord or myself

2696
01:43:09.115 --> 01:43:10.874
take on the appearance so that

2697
01:43:10.874 --> 01:43:15.424
his either affections or ire.

2698
01:43:15.424 --> 01:43:17.678
LAURA: If he comes at me like
he's going to make out with me,

2699
01:43:17.678 --> 01:43:19.150
I'll just drop it, you guys.

2700
01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.853
It's not like I'm going to be like, oh.

2701
01:43:20.853 --> 01:43:23.130
SAM: Sometimes you panic and do weird things, though,

2702
01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:25.547
what if you, I'm just saying.

2703
01:43:26.616 --> 01:43:29.741
I'm just saying. I'm <i>just</i> saying.

2704
01:43:31.576 --> 01:43:32.409
LAURA: I think it's a good idea,

2705
01:43:32.409 --> 01:43:34.319
I think it's a really good idea, you guys.

2706
01:43:34.319 --> 01:43:36.698
TRAVIS: I actually like it a lot.
LAURA: Thank you, Fjord.

2707
01:43:36.698 --> 01:43:39.478
MARISHA: I support you, but I just--

2708
01:43:39.478 --> 01:43:41.555
SAM: Beauregard does not like this idea.

2709
01:43:41.555 --> 01:43:45.944
MARISHA: It sounds, it's weird, it's a little weird,

2710
01:43:45.944 --> 01:43:48.410
and what

2711
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:51.378
almost got you killed in Nicodranas

2712
01:43:51.378 --> 01:43:53.608
was by doing this exact same thing,

2713
01:43:53.608 --> 01:43:55.494
and that's what got you kicked out and banned.

2714
01:43:55.494 --> 01:43:56.537
SAM: Best-case scenario,

2715
01:43:56.537 --> 01:43:58.887
what is the best thing that can happen?

2716
01:43:58.887 --> 01:44:00.670
MARISHA: I care about you!

2717
01:44:00.670 --> 01:44:02.878
LAURA: Best-case scenario, he goes,

2718
01:44:02.878 --> 01:44:04.203
"Marion, I missed you so much,"

2719
01:44:04.203 --> 01:44:05.444
and then I drop, and I go:

2720
01:44:05.444 --> 01:44:07.705
Ha-ha, you fucking liar, you are my dad!

2721
01:44:07.705 --> 01:44:10.649
SAM: Then you betrayed your dad right in front of him.

2722
01:44:10.649 --> 01:44:11.868
LAURA: But he's a Gentleman!

2723
01:44:11.868 --> 01:44:13.442
He's into sneaky shit.

2724
01:44:13.442 --> 01:44:16.260
He'll be like, "Oh, Jester, you're so sneaky,

2725
01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.749
"I respect you so much more than before.

2726
01:44:18.749 --> 01:44:20.170
"That's right, you are my daughter."

2727
01:44:20.170 --> 01:44:21.521
TRAVIS: I like it.

2728
01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:24.104
SAM: I think he'll be embarrassed.

2729
01:44:24.979 --> 01:44:25.870
I think he'll be embarrassed,

2730
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:28.238
and he'll be resentful a little bit.

2731
01:44:28.238 --> 01:44:29.112
TALIESIN: I think so, too.

2732
01:44:29.112 --> 01:44:30.435
MARISHA: Look, I know we're The Mighty Nein,

2733
01:44:30.435 --> 01:44:35.152
and we like to build expectations way before any situation

2734
01:44:35.152 --> 01:44:40.152
we get into, but, just come here.

2735
01:44:40.346 --> 01:44:43.710
I pull her aside, just away from the guys.

2736
01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:46.303
TALIESIN: Have you noticed ever since she got the robe,

2737
01:44:46.303 --> 01:44:48.775
Beau's been really, there's been a take-charge attitude

2738
01:44:48.775 --> 01:44:50.333
that just kicked in.

2739
01:44:50.333 --> 01:44:51.476
SAM: I'm coming, too.

2740
01:44:51.476 --> 01:44:52.574
MARISHA: All right, come on, Chaos Crew.

2741
01:44:52.574 --> 01:44:53.903
LIAM: She's kind of always been a pain in the ass,

2742
01:44:53.903 --> 01:44:56.320
to be honest.
TALIESIN: I'm very impressed by her,

2743
01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.282
I like this new vibe.

2744
01:44:58.282 --> 01:45:00.365
LAURA: What is it?
SAM: Girl talk.

2745
01:45:02.537 --> 01:45:06.987
MARISHA: I want to help you figure this out, I really do.

2746
01:45:06.987 --> 01:45:09.070
I think it's important, if he is your dad,

2747
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:10.798
for you to find that out, I think that's fair,

2748
01:45:10.798 --> 01:45:14.868
and actually maybe have a chance

2749
01:45:14.868 --> 01:45:18.175
at a relationship with your father.

2750
01:45:18.175 --> 01:45:20.998
I want to let you know

2751
01:45:20.998 --> 01:45:25.357
that I'm not trying to shoot down your idea

2752
01:45:25.357 --> 01:45:29.171
because I don't support what you're trying to go for,

2753
01:45:29.171 --> 01:45:32.169
but I just care about you and your safety,

2754
01:45:32.169 --> 01:45:37.119
and this is giving me that tingle up the back of my spine

2755
01:45:37.119 --> 01:45:40.634
like it could backfire in an unsafe way.

2756
01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:41.467
SAM: I agree.

2757
01:45:43.277 --> 01:45:46.135
I will say this, the last several times

2758
01:45:46.135 --> 01:45:48.666
that we've seen my family, I've been in disguise,

2759
01:45:48.666 --> 01:45:53.632
and it just feels wrong, it doesn't feel good,

2760
01:45:54.568 --> 01:45:57.083
it doesn't feel like you're really making a connection

2761
01:45:57.083 --> 01:46:02.073
if you're just deceiving them with your very appearance.

2762
01:46:02.073 --> 01:46:03.231
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: You can do this, Jester,

2763
01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:05.064
go with your instinct!

2764
01:46:07.445 --> 01:46:11.555
LAURA: What if we go, and I go as me,

2765
01:46:11.555 --> 01:46:15.130
and if he is like,

2766
01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:18.162
he just keeps denying it, denying it, denying it,

2767
01:46:18.162 --> 01:46:22.568
then I bamf as Marion, just to see what his reaction is,

2768
01:46:22.568 --> 01:46:25.558
and then I can bamf, because if he really loves my mom,

2769
01:46:25.558 --> 01:46:28.157
then he'd be like (gasps) for a split second.

2770
01:46:28.157 --> 01:46:30.484
MARISHA: That feels more upfront,

2771
01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:33.391
and less potentially bad.

2772
01:46:33.391 --> 01:46:35.576
SAM: I think that you will know

2773
01:46:35.576 --> 01:46:40.576
in the first second of seeing him as yourself

2774
01:46:41.221 --> 01:46:43.957
if he's your dad, just the way he looks at you

2775
01:46:43.957 --> 01:46:48.374
when you walk into the room, you will know instantly.

2776
01:46:49.846 --> 01:46:51.531
LAURA: He makes a whole career out of secrets.

2777
01:46:51.531 --> 01:46:54.698
SAM: I know, but a parent cannot disguise

2778
01:46:56.032 --> 01:46:58.782
the way they look at their child.

2779
01:46:59.977 --> 01:47:03.872
MARISHA: Hey, one of the only good nights that I ever had

2780
01:47:03.872 --> 01:47:08.380
with my dad, I found him with a half-empty bottle of wine,

2781
01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.380
he passed it over to me.

2782
01:47:12.597 --> 01:47:13.781
It was probably the only real conversation

2783
01:47:13.781 --> 01:47:15.364
we really ever had.

2784
01:47:16.635 --> 01:47:18.297
SAM: Were you disguised as your mom?

2785
01:47:18.297 --> 01:47:21.214
MARISHA: No, I can't do that.
SAM: Okay, cool, cool.

2786
01:47:23.388 --> 01:47:27.471
MARISHA: Maybe just sit him down, have a drink with him.

2787
01:47:29.418 --> 01:47:31.418
I don't know.
LAURA: Did you play Uno?

2788
01:47:32.985 --> 01:47:36.595
I always dream of playing Uno with my dad.

2789
01:47:36.595 --> 01:47:39.965
MARISHA: He was more of a Parcheesi type of a guy,

2790
01:47:39.965 --> 01:47:42.722
which was like terrible.

2791
01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:44.489
Who fucking plays Parcheesi?

2792
01:47:44.489 --> 01:47:45.543
MATT: It's a Marquesian game.

2793
01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:50.543
TALIESIN: I was going to say,
are Uno and Parcheesi now weirdly canon?

2794
01:47:51.063 --> 01:47:51.896
Oh boy.

2795
01:47:51.896 --> 01:47:53.788
MARISHA: Invented it. (laughs)

2796
01:47:53.788 --> 01:47:55.054
SAM and MARISHA: Canon.

2797
01:47:55.054 --> 01:47:56.569
(laughter)

2798
01:47:56.569 --> 01:47:58.152
TRAVIS: Jenga, Parcheesi.

2799
01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.479
MATT: Sorry, Hasbro.
MARISHA: Just all Milton Bradley.

2800
01:48:02.479 --> 01:48:04.883
LIAM: My father's name was Milton Bradley.

2801
01:48:04.883 --> 01:48:07.401
LAURA: All right, I won't do it.

2802
01:48:07.401 --> 01:48:11.000
If you guys think it's a bad idea, I won't do it.

2803
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.167
SAM: I think it's a good idea to see him.

2804
01:48:15.316 --> 01:48:17.774
TALIESIN: We're going to be begging for sanctuary.

2805
01:48:17.774 --> 01:48:20.532
MARISHA: Caduceus, you just walk in conversations,

2806
01:48:20.532 --> 01:48:22.547
you just showed up, you scared me.

2807
01:48:22.547 --> 01:48:24.153
TALIESIN: Well, no matter where I go--

2808
01:48:24.153 --> 01:48:26.810
LAURA: It's okay, Caduceus,

2809
01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:28.512
you're welcome into any conversation.

2810
01:48:28.512 --> 01:48:30.249
TALIESIN: Well, you guys were taking a while,

2811
01:48:30.249 --> 01:48:32.338
and I think we should stick together.

2812
01:48:32.338 --> 01:48:34.010
SAM: Yeah, we did just walk three feet away.

2813
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:36.445
All right, let's go.

2814
01:48:36.445 --> 01:48:37.928
TRAVIS: Are we all looking like the Ruby of the Sea

2815
01:48:37.928 --> 01:48:39.505
when we're going?
SAM: Yeah, we're all walking in

2816
01:48:39.505 --> 01:48:41.074
as the Ruby of the Sea.

2817
01:48:41.074 --> 01:48:43.157
(laughter)

2818
01:48:43.157 --> 01:48:44.627
LAURA: Just like Harry Potter,

2819
01:48:44.627 --> 01:48:45.489
all of us.
TRAVIS: We say all in unison,

2820
01:48:45.489 --> 01:48:47.239
"It's nice to see you."

2821
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:51.551
LIAM: If we go tomorrow, we can do that.

2822
01:48:51.551 --> 01:48:52.872
SAM: But not today.

2823
01:48:52.872 --> 01:48:54.352
LAURA: No, because then I won't be able to see

2824
01:48:54.352 --> 01:48:57.651
the way he looks at me, right?

2825
01:48:57.651 --> 01:49:01.245
TALIESIN: How far away are we from the Gentleman's?

2826
01:49:01.245 --> 01:49:02.247
MATT: Let's see.

2827
01:49:02.247 --> 01:49:04.079
He would be in the Interstead Sprawl,

2828
01:49:04.079 --> 01:49:06.329
maybe like a 40-minute walk

2829
01:49:06.329 --> 01:49:07.162
from where you currently are,

2830
01:49:07.162 --> 01:49:09.524
not terribly far from the Pentamarket.

2831
01:49:09.524 --> 01:49:11.458
Maybe a little less of a walk.

2832
01:49:11.458 --> 01:49:13.525
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my eyes very open,

2833
01:49:13.525 --> 01:49:15.881
and I'm going to use Enhance Ability for the walk,

2834
01:49:15.881 --> 01:49:17.279
and spend some.

2835
01:49:17.279 --> 01:49:20.446
MATT: Are you guys bee-lining right there?

2836
01:49:21.299 --> 01:49:22.751
LAURA: Yes, what are we doing?

2837
01:49:22.751 --> 01:49:24.201
MATT: It's up to you guys.
SAM: We're just going to walk.

2838
01:49:24.201 --> 01:49:25.242
MATT: Okay.

2839
01:49:25.242 --> 01:49:26.909
LAURA: With totally like,

2840
01:49:27.778 --> 01:49:29.340
the minute we walk outside.
TALIESIN: Are we being followed,

2841
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.477
I'm keeping my eyes--

2842
01:49:31.477 --> 01:49:32.824
MATT: A perception check.

2843
01:49:32.824 --> 01:49:34.466
LAURA: I'm going to attack the darkness.

2844
01:49:34.466 --> 01:49:37.020
(laughter)

2845
01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.345
TALIESIN: That's a 24.

2846
01:49:38.345 --> 01:49:39.178
MATT: Okay.

2847
01:49:40.339 --> 01:49:44.874
Other than drawing a few looks, most of them towards Nott,

2848
01:49:44.874 --> 01:49:48.090
who is unabashedly in goblin form,

2849
01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:50.849
a few people give a strange eye,

2850
01:49:50.849 --> 01:49:54.182
and you are wearing some unique threads.

2851
01:49:57.315 --> 01:49:58.991
So you're drawing a few stares,

2852
01:49:58.991 --> 01:50:02.656
but it seems no one's following you.

2853
01:50:02.656 --> 01:50:05.197
You're just not inconspicuous.

2854
01:50:05.197 --> 01:50:07.609
MARISHA: Do we need to walk back-to-back all the way there?

2855
01:50:07.609 --> 01:50:09.182
Like link arms?

2856
01:50:09.182 --> 01:50:12.734
TRAVIS: Not inconspicuous. (laughs)

2857
01:50:12.734 --> 01:50:14.895
Linked arms and rotating in circles.

2858
01:50:14.895 --> 01:50:16.106
MATT: Just like a phalanx.

2859
01:50:16.106 --> 01:50:18.619
(laughter)

2860
01:50:18.619 --> 01:50:20.976
TRAVIS: Look dear, the circus.

2861
01:50:20.976 --> 01:50:22.476
Street performers.

2862
01:50:25.086 --> 01:50:27.876
LIAM: Caleb is going to take out, he still has a brown cloak

2863
01:50:27.876 --> 01:50:29.446
that he got in Zadash ages ago,

2864
01:50:29.446 --> 01:50:31.937
and he's going to cover up his Zemnian clothing

2865
01:50:31.937 --> 01:50:33.129
as they walk through town.

2866
01:50:33.129 --> 01:50:34.939
SAM: It's a white cloak that was just made brown

2867
01:50:34.939 --> 01:50:36.999
by contact with Caleb's body.

2868
01:50:36.999 --> 01:50:39.470
LIAM: Constant fear, just constant shitting,

2869
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:40.970
non-stop shitting.

2870
01:50:43.018 --> 01:50:43.851
MATT: All right.

2871
01:50:43.851 --> 01:50:47.138
LAURA: We all put on our non-Zemnian?

2872
01:50:47.138 --> 01:50:48.707
MATT: Or Zemnian clothing?

2873
01:50:48.707 --> 01:50:51.306
LAURA: Yes, we put on, yes.

2874
01:50:51.306 --> 01:50:52.139
MATT: Okay.

2875
01:50:53.427 --> 01:50:57.038
So you make your way over to The Evening Nip.

2876
01:50:57.038 --> 01:50:59.661
As you enter the dark dive bar interior,

2877
01:50:59.661 --> 01:51:03.390
bring back memories to your first journey here to Zadash,

2878
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:07.658
you come across the familiar burned, scarred dwarf,

2879
01:51:07.658 --> 01:51:09.907
Clive, who watches the entrance.

2880
01:51:09.907 --> 01:51:11.917
He gives you all a stern look for a second,

2881
01:51:11.917 --> 01:51:14.351
not recognizing you as you enter.

2882
01:51:14.351 --> 01:51:15.696
"Can I help you?"

2883
01:51:15.696 --> 01:51:17.846
SAM: We bring many gifts.

2884
01:51:19.391 --> 01:51:21.724
TRAVIS: Fucking-- man, you are fast.

2885
01:51:24.013 --> 01:51:26.826
MATT: You're led over towards the doorway,

2886
01:51:26.826 --> 01:51:29.453
and you descend into the spiral staircase,

2887
01:51:29.453 --> 01:51:32.230
down into the Gentleman's lair.

2888
01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:33.785
As you enter the chamber below,

2889
01:51:33.785 --> 01:51:37.106
you can see some old faces, some new faces.

2890
01:51:37.106 --> 01:51:39.717
The large ogre that previously was the overall

2891
01:51:39.717 --> 01:51:43.142
watch bouncer there is staying there.

2892
01:51:43.142 --> 01:51:47.408
(growls) Just glances over.

2893
01:51:47.408 --> 01:51:48.678
You can see a few figures sitting,

2894
01:51:48.678 --> 01:51:51.139
they all look as you begin to walk down the steps,

2895
01:51:51.139 --> 01:51:54.295
everyone putting their hand towards their blade,

2896
01:51:54.295 --> 01:51:58.171
and then no relaxing, the new faces don't relax,

2897
01:51:58.171 --> 01:52:00.032
some of the ones that you recognize

2898
01:52:00.032 --> 01:52:02.417
slacken a little bit.

2899
01:52:02.417 --> 01:52:05.279
To the back of the chamber, where you've many times

2900
01:52:05.279 --> 01:52:08.333
seen The Gentleman, he is sitting there

2901
01:52:08.333 --> 01:52:10.620
with a pair of spectacles the end of his nose,

2902
01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:12.172
currently poring over what looks like

2903
01:52:12.172 --> 01:52:15.433
a stack of paperwork with a number of large bags

2904
01:52:15.433 --> 01:52:17.855
on the table, and is currently in the process

2905
01:52:17.855 --> 01:52:22.522
of counting and putting gold into what looks like sacks.

2906
01:52:23.653 --> 01:52:26.517
You're not sure what the breadth or reason of this is.

2907
01:52:26.517 --> 01:52:28.178
Then standing behind, you see Sorah,

2908
01:52:28.178 --> 01:52:29.880
the female goliath bodyguard

2909
01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:33.389
just staring you all down as you approach.

2910
01:52:33.389 --> 01:52:36.598
He takes a moment, looks up,

2911
01:52:36.598 --> 01:52:41.047
"Oh my goodness, it has been some time, has it not?"

2912
01:52:41.047 --> 01:52:43.460
He takes the glasses off, sets them down.

2913
01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.491
"Mighty Nein, right?"

2914
01:52:45.491 --> 01:52:48.216
TRAVIS: Indeed.
MATT: "You look--

2915
01:52:48.216 --> 01:52:51.177
"You look different, hardened.

2916
01:52:51.177 --> 01:52:55.819
"I take it this war has been profitable for you as well?"

2917
01:52:55.819 --> 01:52:58.368
MARISHA: No, we've actually been pretty broke, I feel like.

2918
01:52:58.368 --> 01:53:01.652
SAM: We're doing okay right now.
LIAM: Ebbs and flows, you know.

2919
01:53:02.678 --> 01:53:06.547
MATT: "Oh, there are better businesses in times of war.

2920
01:53:06.547 --> 01:53:10.834
"Are you come for work, because I have plenty."

2921
01:53:10.834 --> 01:53:13.834
SAM: I'll just hand him a handkerchief.

2922
01:53:16.224 --> 01:53:19.646
You just have a little schvitz there,

2923
01:53:19.646 --> 01:53:22.204
you're schvitzing a little bit.

2924
01:53:23.588 --> 01:53:24.678
MATT: "Thank you."

2925
01:53:24.678 --> 01:53:26.754
TALIESIN: We've actually come for help,

2926
01:53:26.754 --> 01:53:30.209
and hopefully to have a conversation about--

2927
01:53:30.209 --> 01:53:33.209
LAURA: About the fact that you're my dad!

2928
01:53:34.179 --> 01:53:35.386
SAM: Insight check!

2929
01:53:35.386 --> 01:53:37.133
(laughter)

2930
01:53:37.133 --> 01:53:39.057
MATT: Make an insight check.

2931
01:53:39.057 --> 01:53:39.890
SAM: Four!

2932
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:41.934
(laughter)

2933
01:53:41.934 --> 01:53:43.204
TALIESIN: I've got the insight up anyway,

2934
01:53:43.204 --> 01:53:46.690
I have advantage rolling right now.

2935
01:53:46.690 --> 01:53:49.023
That's 25.

2936
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.130
SAM: Oh guys!

2937
01:53:52.130 --> 01:53:53.029
TALIESIN: Do you know what the worst part is?

2938
01:53:53.029 --> 01:53:54.513
LAURA: Huh?

2939
01:53:54.513 --> 01:53:56.924
SAM: O'Brick!

2940
01:53:56.924 --> 01:54:00.044
LIAM: Nott is out in the front, just going like (grunts),

2941
01:54:00.044 --> 01:54:02.261
and Caduceus is 10 feet back, going, yeah.

2942
01:54:02.261 --> 01:54:04.693
(laughter)

2943
01:54:04.693 --> 01:54:06.483
SAM: I don't know what to announce.

2944
01:54:06.483 --> 01:54:08.551
You know what, Laura, you know what we have

2945
01:54:08.551 --> 01:54:11.356
that's really soft and nice?

2946
01:54:11.356 --> 01:54:13.838
SAM and LAURA: Blankets.

2947
01:54:13.838 --> 01:54:16.921
SAM: They're Tal'Dorei map blankets, guys.

2948
01:54:20.385 --> 01:54:22.552
MATT: "We've been through this.

2949
01:54:24.253 --> 01:54:29.253
"So I have a deep contact

2950
01:54:29.326 --> 01:54:31.069
"from beyond the battlefield,

2951
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:34.127
"and the lines and the current conflict,

2952
01:54:34.127 --> 01:54:36.331
"providing me with intel.

2953
01:54:36.331 --> 01:54:37.567
"Keeps me from being surprised,

2954
01:54:37.567 --> 01:54:40.618
"which is the majority of my business.

2955
01:54:40.618 --> 01:54:43.136
"He spoke of a troop of Dwendalian defectors,

2956
01:54:43.136 --> 01:54:47.312
"who championed a great boon to their queen.

2957
01:54:47.312 --> 01:54:48.499
"Not going to lie, the vague description

2958
01:54:48.499 --> 01:54:50.249
"did tickle my memory."

2959
01:54:52.243 --> 01:54:55.326
MARISHA: Anything else tickling your memory?

2960
01:54:57.115 --> 01:55:00.115
TALIESIN: I think I have a proposal for you.

2961
01:55:01.895 --> 01:55:05.436
We find ourselves in need of, just to start with,

2962
01:55:05.436 --> 01:55:07.089
some sanctuary for the evening.

2963
01:55:07.089 --> 01:55:08.245
We're being hunted.

2964
01:55:08.245 --> 01:55:11.486
MATT: Oh yeah, sanctuary is very much one of the things

2965
01:55:11.486 --> 01:55:13.537
that we can provide for compatriots

2966
01:55:13.537 --> 01:55:18.137
and business relationships.

2967
01:55:18.137 --> 01:55:20.149
TALIESIN: If we give you some intelligence,

2968
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:22.245
because we know some stuff, and we have some stuff

2969
01:55:22.245 --> 01:55:26.309
that I think might affect your business in the city,

2970
01:55:26.309 --> 01:55:28.281
would you be willing to maybe help us

2971
01:55:28.281 --> 01:55:30.126
with our problem, and in return,

2972
01:55:30.126 --> 01:55:33.626
we'll see how much we know that you don't?

2973
01:55:36.259 --> 01:55:40.260
MATT: "Your sentence structure confuses me,

2974
01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:41.630
"but you seem like an earnest fellow."

2975
01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:43.857
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2976
01:55:43.857 --> 01:55:45.690
MATT: "Sure, go ahead and--"

2977
01:55:46.747 --> 01:55:51.035
TALIESIN: It was really hard to put together in my head.

2978
01:55:51.035 --> 01:55:52.615
TRAVIS: Almost as if you were making it up.

2979
01:55:52.615 --> 01:55:54.668
MATT: "Interesting idea.

2980
01:55:54.668 --> 01:55:57.322
"Go ahead and provide the intel."

2981
01:55:57.322 --> 01:56:00.156
TALIESIN: Well, for starters, that definitely was us

2982
01:56:00.156 --> 01:56:02.143
that you heard talk about.

2983
01:56:02.143 --> 01:56:03.750
MATT: "Wow."

2984
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:05.183
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2985
01:56:05.183 --> 01:56:06.433
TALIESIN: There's more.

2986
01:56:08.777 --> 01:56:10.740
Beau, if you want to get in on some of this,

2987
01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:14.638
we are currently being hunted by what we thought was a cult

2988
01:56:14.638 --> 01:56:18.153
called the Angel of Irons, but it turns out--

2989
01:56:18.153 --> 01:56:21.468
I don't know if you've heard of the Angel of Irons.

2990
01:56:21.468 --> 01:56:24.693
Has he heard of the Angel of Irons?

2991
01:56:25.689 --> 01:56:26.989
Insight check?

2992
01:56:26.989 --> 01:56:29.697
MATT: Make an insight check.

2993
01:56:29.697 --> 01:56:30.905
TALIESIN: 22.

2994
01:56:32.084 --> 01:56:34.123
MATT: "I can't say that I have.

2995
01:56:34.123 --> 01:56:37.029
"Sounds culty, to be perfectly honest."

2996
01:56:37.029 --> 01:56:39.313
MARISHA: Yeah, it's basically a cult.

2997
01:56:39.313 --> 01:56:42.467
LIAM: What do you know about the Betrayer Gods?

2998
01:56:42.467 --> 01:56:45.762
MATT: Well, you did a roll a 22.

2999
01:56:45.762 --> 01:56:47.195
TRAVIS: You guys, all month long,

3000
01:56:47.195 --> 01:56:50.887
Critical Role is partnering with OSD.

3001
01:56:50.887 --> 01:56:53.960
The link is critrole.com/OSD,

3002
01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.494
supporting our military communities.

3003
01:56:55.494 --> 01:56:56.815
SAM: If you support them, you'll feel as comfy

3004
01:56:56.815 --> 01:56:58.205
as you would with a blanket.

3005
01:56:58.205 --> 01:57:00.105
LIAM: (Rick voice) W-what you mean, I'm your dad?

3006
01:57:00.105 --> 01:57:01.263
LAURA: Oh.

3007
01:57:06.353 --> 01:57:08.000
TRAVIS: Caleb, you were saying?

3008
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.833
SAM: Tharizdun, have you ever heard of Tharizdun?

3009
01:57:13.033 --> 01:57:16.592
MATT: "I know of the tales.

3010
01:57:16.592 --> 01:57:17.795
"Why?"

3011
01:57:17.795 --> 01:57:21.237
MARISHA: Yeah, this cult wants to bring him back.

3012
01:57:21.237 --> 01:57:22.660
Unleash him.

3013
01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:24.507
SAM: They've already made some progress.

3014
01:57:24.507 --> 01:57:26.212
TALIESIN: They're doing quite well.

3015
01:57:26.212 --> 01:57:28.063
MARISHA: Poking holes.

3016
01:57:28.063 --> 01:57:30.445
TRAVIS: They seem to be parading around in your city

3017
01:57:30.445 --> 01:57:31.278
at the moment.

3018
01:57:31.278 --> 01:57:33.879
LAURA: He just attacked the shit out of us.

3019
01:57:33.879 --> 01:57:36.879
TALIESIN: The assassin, the Inevitable End.

3020
01:57:38.835 --> 01:57:39.871
It's the name of the assassin

3021
01:57:39.871 --> 01:57:43.217
who just attempted to attack us.

3022
01:57:43.217 --> 01:57:46.200
LAURA: Successfully, wasn't an attempt.
TALIESIN: Successfully.

3023
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:49.693
MATT: "All right, and you escaped and then you came here.

3024
01:57:49.693 --> 01:57:51.153
"Were you followed?"

3025
01:57:51.153 --> 01:57:52.836
SAM: No, no, no.

3026
01:57:52.836 --> 01:57:53.721
LAURA: Of course not.

3027
01:57:53.721 --> 01:57:56.725
TALIESIN: I did my best to make sure we weren't followed.

3028
01:57:56.725 --> 01:57:59.908
LAURA: We were being super stealthy on the way over.

3029
01:57:59.908 --> 01:58:03.032
MARISHA: We were in our circle, remember?

3030
01:58:03.032 --> 01:58:06.939
TALIESIN: Well, I was watching, I didn't see any signs

3031
01:58:06.939 --> 01:58:08.791
of being followed.

3032
01:58:08.791 --> 01:58:11.503
LIAM: The issue that we are concerned about

3033
01:58:11.503 --> 01:58:16.078
is that they are...

3034
01:58:16.078 --> 01:58:18.687
bringing something

3035
01:58:18.687 --> 01:58:20.736
that seems cataclysmic upon the world,

3036
01:58:20.736 --> 01:58:23.786
and the war is their cover.

3037
01:58:27.092 --> 01:58:30.284
MATT: "I mean, that is rather dire."

3038
01:58:31.743 --> 01:58:36.428
TALIESIN: They were the ones that attacked the Cobalt Soul.

3039
01:58:36.428 --> 01:58:37.598
They're the ones who've been opening,

3040
01:58:37.598 --> 01:58:41.516
on both sides of the war, rifts to other dimensions,

3041
01:58:41.516 --> 01:58:42.595
letting creatures through,

3042
01:58:42.595 --> 01:58:45.179
trying to get the other side to take blame.

3043
01:58:45.179 --> 01:58:46.518
MATT: "That's terrifying."

3044
01:58:46.518 --> 01:58:49.679
MARISHA: It's unclear how far the corruption reaches,

3045
01:58:49.679 --> 01:58:54.124
and exactly its influences on the current world events,

3046
01:58:54.124 --> 01:58:57.414
but we know it's bad.

3047
01:58:57.414 --> 01:58:58.612
TALIESIN: Both governments.

3048
01:58:58.612 --> 01:59:02.681
SAM: We also know that you are normally much more concerned

3049
01:59:02.681 --> 01:59:05.866
with your own business and your own profits,

3050
01:59:05.866 --> 01:59:09.494
so all of this information might be interesting to you,

3051
01:59:09.494 --> 01:59:11.596
but what do you want with us?

3052
01:59:11.596 --> 01:59:14.191
We have traveled far and wide now,

3053
01:59:14.191 --> 01:59:18.832
and have allies in distant corners of the realm.

3054
01:59:18.832 --> 01:59:21.499
MATT: "Here's my perspective on this:

3055
01:59:23.375 --> 01:59:24.625
"I'm a smuggler.

3056
01:59:26.728 --> 01:59:29.961
"I'm certain all of this is

3057
01:59:29.961 --> 01:59:33.709
"terrible and dangerous.

3058
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:37.876
"This is far above any of our pay grades down here.

3059
01:59:39.250 --> 01:59:41.840
"If you want sanctuary, you have it.

3060
01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:44.748
"If you want work, I'll find it.

3061
01:59:44.748 --> 01:59:49.245
"If you want something that's hard to acquire,

3062
01:59:49.245 --> 01:59:52.036
"that somebody else currently holds onto,

3063
01:59:52.036 --> 01:59:53.619
"I can arrange that.

3064
01:59:55.383 --> 02:00:00.383
"But going after terrible gods from eons past

3065
02:00:00.572 --> 02:00:03.399
"and cults that are embedded in governments,

02:00:03.399 --> 02:00:08.192
"using a proxy war, this, I'm going to be perfectly honest,

3067
02:00:08.192 --> 02:00:11.939
"is far beyond anything I want to get involved with."

3068
02:00:11.939 --> 02:00:14.356
LAURA: Do you smuggle people?

3069
02:00:19.976 --> 02:00:21.676
MATT: "I try not to."

3070
02:00:24.937 --> 02:00:27.025
MARISHA: Have you smuggled people here recently?

3071
02:00:27.025 --> 02:00:29.108
Has there been a request?

3072
02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:31.095
MATT: "Recently, no.

3073
02:00:31.095 --> 02:00:35.432
"Since I've reconnected with the Marduns,

3074
02:00:35.432 --> 02:00:40.432
"I've been able to close my business opportunities

02:00:40.445 --> 02:00:43.501
"that dealt with such things.

"just never quite rubbed me the right way.

"I've done things I'm not proud of."

3079
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:57.908
LIAM: You are no altruist, that is no surprise to us.

3080
02:00:57.908 --> 02:01:00.133
You are a smuggler.

3081
02:01:00.133 --> 02:01:04.947
Have you smuggled anything extraordinary

3082
02:01:04.947 --> 02:01:06.364
in recent months?

3083
02:01:09.734 --> 02:01:14.734
MATT: "I've sold a number of relics out of the Savalirwood.

3084
02:01:15.208 --> 02:01:16.423
"That's primarily some of the business

"to the Stassmans out in Kamordah."

3092
02:01:33.809 --> 02:01:37.392
SAM: Stassmans in Kamordah?

3093
02:01:39.024 --> 02:01:40.566
LAURA: That would be the skull of the person

3094
02:01:40.566 --> 02:01:41.807
that just attacked us.

3095
02:01:41.807 --> 02:01:43.162
SAM: Who's the Stassmans?

3096
02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:44.185
TRAVIS: I believe the Stassmans

3097
02:01:44.185 --> 02:01:48.154
are the people that are chasing us, perhaps.

3098
02:01:48.154 --> 02:01:49.447
MATT: "Stassmans chasing you?

3099
02:01:49.447 --> 02:01:52.074
"They're a wine family."

3100
02:01:52.074 --> 02:01:54.364
TRAVIS: No, I don't believe they are.

3101
02:01:54.364 --> 02:01:57.282
LAURA: That's why they were by-- remember?

3102
02:01:57.282 --> 02:01:59.689
They were by your family, Beau.

3103
02:01:59.689 --> 02:02:00.730
That's why.

3104
02:02:00.730 --> 02:02:01.885
The Stassmans have the skull.

3105
02:02:01.885 --> 02:02:04.954
MATT: "They've had a taste for
unique antiquities for decades.

3106
02:02:04.954 --> 02:02:07.920
"They have quite the collection, and they pay well.

3107
02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.291
LAURA: They might not have known.

3108
02:02:09.291 --> 02:02:10.572
TRAVIS: Velvin Thicket?

3109
02:02:10.572 --> 02:02:12.698
LAURA: They were over by Beau's family.

3110
02:02:12.698 --> 02:02:15.227
SAM: So they imported the skull,

3111
02:02:15.227 --> 02:02:19.069
and then Obann went there to get it.

3112
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.902
LAURA: Yeah.

3113
02:02:19.902 --> 02:02:22.522
SAM: Were they working for Obann,
or was it just coincidence?

3114
02:02:22.522 --> 02:02:24.122
LAURA: The Stassmans might be dead.

3115
02:02:24.122 --> 02:02:27.464
TRAVIS: You said they've been
gathering antiquities for years?

3116
02:02:27.464 --> 02:02:29.653
MATT: "For decades, yeah."
TRAVIS: For decades.

3117
02:02:29.653 --> 02:02:33.198
How many of these antiquities have you supplied them with?

3118
02:02:33.198 --> 02:02:35.127
MATT: "Oh, well over a dozen, probably."

3119
02:02:35.127 --> 02:02:38.927
TRAVIS: Do you happen to have an inventory, a record

3120
02:02:38.927 --> 02:02:39.851
of what those things might've been?

3121
02:02:39.851 --> 02:02:42.830
TALIESIN: We're so sorry to ask, but this is--

3122
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:43.962
MATT: "I'm so sorry to disappoint.

3123
02:02:43.962 --> 02:02:48.019
"Part of my business is keeping certain elements to myself."

3124
02:02:48.019 --> 02:02:51.757
TRAVIS: Of course, perhaps a favor for a favor, then?

3125
02:02:51.757 --> 02:02:52.846
I'm sure coin--

3126
02:02:52.846 --> 02:02:55.662
MATT: "Of course, I've given you sanctuary for the evening.

3127
02:02:55.662 --> 02:02:58.235
"What favor do you owe me now?"

3128
02:02:58.235 --> 02:02:59.678
TRAVIS: We would be very interested to learn

3129
02:02:59.678 --> 02:03:01.757
what some of these relics might be.

3130
02:03:01.757 --> 02:03:06.132
Perhaps there is a job of particular import

3131
02:03:06.132 --> 02:03:08.465
that needs a delicate touch?

3132
02:03:10.052 --> 02:03:11.611
MATT: "I appreciate what you're saying,

3133
02:03:11.611 --> 02:03:15.835
"but I do not relinquish that information.

3134

"I run a business, and that business runs on trust

02:03:19.715 --> 02:03:22.931
"between the clients and myself."

3136
02:03:24.534 --> 02:03:26.019
LIAM: Well, gather up your pennies,

3137
02:03:26.019 --> 02:03:27.393
because there are forces at work

3138
02:03:27.393 --> 02:03:29.944
that will tear it all down around us.

3139
02:03:29.944 --> 02:03:31.811
MATT: "Well then,

3140
02:03:33.527 --> 02:03:35.393
"I hope the allies you have

3141
02:03:35.393 --> 02:03:37.857
"in both governments are helpful."

3142
02:03:37.857 --> 02:03:38.943
TRAVIS: We do, as well.

3143
02:03:38.943 --> 02:03:43.037
Have you heard any rumblings about a particular item,

3144
02:03:43.037 --> 02:03:46.494
perhaps traveling from the Dynasty into the Empire?

3145
02:03:46.494 --> 02:03:48.863
It's been referred to as a Beacon.

3146
02:03:48.863 --> 02:03:50.982
MARISHA: It's geometric in shape.

3147
02:03:50.982 --> 02:03:53.514
TRAVIS: It has magical properties?

3148
02:03:53.514 --> 02:03:54.745
MARISHA: 12-sided.

3149
02:03:54.745 --> 02:03:58.162
MATT: "Doesn't ring a bell."
LAURA: If you look into it, it's really lucky.

3150
02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:00.404
MATT: "Can't say I have."

3151
02:04:00.404 --> 02:04:02.574
Make an insight check.

3152
02:04:02.574 --> 02:04:04.764
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I'll join that insight check.

3153
02:04:04.764 --> 02:04:06.958
MATT: Okay, both of you guys roll.

3154
02:04:06.958 --> 02:04:08.614
SAM: Stassmans.

3155
02:04:08.614 --> 02:04:10.896
MARISHA: I'm slowly migrating my way over towards Jester

3156
02:04:10.896 --> 02:04:12.114
while this is happening.

3157
02:04:12.114 --> 02:04:12.947
TALIESIN: 20.

3158
02:04:14.575 --> 02:04:15.409
LIAM: Lower, 13.

3159
02:04:15.409 --> 02:04:16.984
MATT: Okay.

3160
02:04:16.984 --> 02:04:18.323
SAM: Taliesin whispers, guys.

3161
02:04:18.323 --> 02:04:19.748
MATT: ♪ All these Taliesin whispers ♪

3162
02:04:19.748 --> 02:04:21.648
TALIESIN: I'm at the point where I'm almost out of--

3163
02:04:21.648 --> 02:04:25.540
LIAM: DM from his lap, just stay there.

3164
02:04:26.415 --> 02:04:29.591
SAM: Dndbeyond.link/rickandmorty, everybody.

3165
02:04:29.591 --> 02:04:32.455
Hey, should we pass out those healing potions?

3166
02:04:32.455 --> 02:04:33.480
TRAVIS: They're all for me.

3167
02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.313
SAM: Okay.

3168
02:04:36.193 --> 02:04:39.784
SAM: Have you talked to the Stassmans lately?

3169
02:04:39.784 --> 02:04:42.236
Do you know if they're alive?

3170
02:04:42.236 --> 02:04:44.540
MATT: "No, I-- alive?"

3171
02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:45.948
LAURA: They might be dead,

3172
02:04:45.948 --> 02:04:48.047
because they could've gone there and killed them

3173
02:04:48.047 --> 02:04:51.149
just to get this skull from them.

3174
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:52.396
TALIESIN: Same people.

3175
02:04:52.396 --> 02:04:54.113
MATT: "I'll look into it."

3176
02:04:54.113 --> 02:04:55.173
TALIESIN: If there's any way to find out,

3177
02:04:55.173 --> 02:04:56.077
that would be very helpful.

3178
02:04:56.077 --> 02:05:00.080
MATT: Snaps his fingers, and you see the strange little

3179
02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:02.864
creepy gnome-ish halfling-looking person,

3180
02:05:02.864 --> 02:05:07.864
you're not quite certain what race,

3181
02:05:08.563 --> 02:05:10.959
but they approach, and he's,

3182
02:05:10.959 --> 02:05:14.134
"Could you please look into Stassmans for me?"

3183
02:05:14.134 --> 02:05:15.254
(Dweez cackles)

3184
02:05:15.254 --> 02:05:16.889
MARISHA: Would I remember anything about the Stassmans?

3185
02:05:16.889 --> 02:05:18.707
MATT: Saunters off.

3186
02:05:18.707 --> 02:05:21.540
They're a competitive wine family.

3187
02:05:23.236 --> 02:05:24.069
They're wealthy.

3188
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:25.367
TRAVIS: What area are they from?

3189
02:05:25.367 --> 02:05:28.937
MATT: Kamordah.
TRAVIS: Sorry, you said that, yep.

3190
02:05:28.937 --> 02:05:33.043
MATT: They're kind of the Addams Family of Kamordah.

3191
02:05:33.043 --> 02:05:34.157
MARISHA: Creepy house on the hill?

3192
02:05:34.157 --> 02:05:38.967
MATT: Yeah, they're strange, they have an aesthetic

3193
02:05:38.967 --> 02:05:42.882
that doesn't mix with the rest of the people there.

3194
02:05:42.882 --> 02:05:45.915
They're not terrible, but they're definitely wealthy.

3195
02:05:45.915 --> 02:05:47.384
They flaunt it a bit,

3196
02:05:47.384 --> 02:05:50.123
and they have unique interests

3197
02:05:50.123 --> 02:05:52.797
in a home-based museum.

3198
02:05:52.797 --> 02:05:56.974
They actually, on one of the houses

3199
02:05:56.974 --> 02:06:00.427
that many of the various diplomats and nobles

3200
02:06:00.427 --> 02:06:02.512
from across the empire and sometimes the Menagerie Coast

3201
02:06:02.512 --> 02:06:04.352
come and invite them to stay with them,

3202
02:06:04.352 --> 02:06:06.341
partially to show off what they have,

3203
02:06:06.341 --> 02:06:08.361
and to make more connections to possibly

3204
02:06:08.361 --> 02:06:09.676
continue to embolden that collection.

3205
02:06:09.676 --> 02:06:11.726
TALIESIN: Like the family from The 'Burbs, I'm very excited.

3206
02:06:11.726 --> 02:06:12.968
MATT: Kinda, yeah, actually.

3207
02:06:12.968 --> 02:06:14.468
TALIESIN: Love that movie.

3208
02:06:17.978 --> 02:06:20.351
MATT: "But please, make the place your own,

3209
02:06:20.351 --> 02:06:25.012
"and if anything does come up that can be of help to you,

3210
02:06:25.012 --> 02:06:30.012
"I'll let you know, but please understand,

3211
02:06:31.466 --> 02:06:32.966
"this is beyond me."

3212
02:06:35.507 --> 02:06:40.507
MARISHA: I just whisper, I nudge Jester.

3213
02:06:43.079 --> 02:06:44.496
LAURA: One last thing.

3214
02:06:45.532 --> 02:06:48.008
I cast Disguise Self and turn myself into Marion.

3215
02:06:48.008 --> 02:06:50.227
TRAVIS: Get it! Get it, queen!

3216
02:06:50.227 --> 02:06:51.060
Let's go!

3217
02:06:52.068 --> 02:06:53.034
MATT: Okay.

3218
02:06:53.034 --> 02:06:55.480
MARISHA: What's he do? What's he do?

3219
02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:56.361
MATT: As soon as it goes up,

3220
02:06:56.361 --> 02:06:59.785
because he's putting his glasses back on as this happens,

3221
02:06:59.785 --> 02:07:01.202
and he goes like--

3222
02:07:03.954 --> 02:07:05.645
LAURA: (like Marion) Babenon.

3223
02:07:06.776 --> 02:07:09.001
MATT: "What is this devilry?"

3224
02:07:10.638 --> 02:07:13.730
SAM: Oh, do you know the Ruby of the Sea?

3225
02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:15.452
MATT: "I've heard of her, yes.

3226
02:07:15.452 --> 02:07:17.161
"Is this her?"

3227
02:07:17.161 --> 02:07:18.819
MARISHA: Insight check!

3228
02:07:18.819 --> 02:07:19.839
MATT: Make an insight check.

3229
02:07:19.839 --> 02:07:21.162
TRAVIS: I'll help you!
MARISHA: Help me!

3230
02:07:21.162 --> 02:07:22.492
TALIESIN: Are you just going to take my insight check,

3231
02:07:22.492 --> 02:07:24.239
because I just did one, too.

3232
02:07:24.239 --> 02:07:25.391
MARISHA: Oh.

3233
02:07:25.391 --> 02:07:26.224
TRAVIS: Do it!

3234
02:07:27.300 --> 02:07:29.570
LAURA: I do it, too. I'm looking him in the eye.

3235
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:30.853
SAM: Everyone's insighting.

3236
02:07:30.853 --> 02:07:31.686
LAURA: Well, I mean--

3237
02:07:31.686 --> 02:07:33.245
TRAVIS: That's a five.
MARISHA: Natural one.

3238
02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:34.697
LIAM: Great journey to a one.

3239
02:07:34.697 --> 02:07:37.936
LAURA: I'm probably going to get a one as well.

3240
02:07:37.936 --> 02:07:39.353
I got a two.

3241
02:07:39.353 --> 02:07:40.969
MATT: Oh, Laura.
TALIESIN: 27.

3242
02:07:42.834 --> 02:07:43.667
MATT: You've already made an insight check.

3243
02:07:43.667 --> 02:07:44.761
TALIESIN: It hasn't changed from the last time?

3244
02:07:44.761 --> 02:07:46.428
Okay, just checking.

3245
02:07:48.388 --> 02:07:50.798
SAM: Some say she's the best lay ever.

3246
02:07:50.798 --> 02:07:52.879
MATT: "Well, that's impressive.

3247
02:07:52.879 --> 02:07:55.962
"Maybe I'll have to stop by someday."

3248
02:07:58.103 --> 02:08:00.768
LAURA: I drop Disguise Self.

3249
02:08:00.768 --> 02:08:02.685
TALIESIN: He looks at Caduceus.

3250
02:08:05.049 --> 02:08:07.132
"I have work to attend to.

3251
02:08:08.368 --> 02:08:10.152
"It's payday, and I like to make sure

02:08:10.152 --> 02:08:11.776
"that my employees are well taken care of."

3253
02:08:11.776 --> 02:08:13.630
He puts the glasses completely on

3254
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:15.100
and begins counting coins and going back to his--

3255
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.135
MARISHA: Hey, Gentleman?

3256
02:08:17.135 --> 02:08:18.637
MATT: "Yes?"

3257
02:08:18.637 --> 02:08:20.985
SAM: I think you can call him Man for short.

3258
02:08:20.985 --> 02:08:21.818
MARISHA: Mr. Man?

3259
02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:24.460
MATT: "Gentleman's fine."

3260
02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:26.457
TALIESIN: Mr. Gentleman.

3261
02:08:26.457 --> 02:08:27.364
MARISHA: You wouldn't happen to know

3262
02:08:27.364 --> 02:08:29.745
who's on the Tal'Dorei Council?

3263
02:08:29.745 --> 02:08:32.350
(laughter)

3264
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:34.297
TRAVIS: Wow. That is deep.

3265
02:08:34.297 --> 02:08:36.416
Fucking two hours and 10 minutes.

3266
02:08:36.416 --> 02:08:40.041
Oh, fuck. (laughs)

3267
02:08:41.005 --> 02:08:42.140
LAURA: I love you.

3268
02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:44.655
(laughter)

3269
02:08:44.655 --> 02:08:47.688
TRAVIS: 130 minutes.

3270
02:08:47.688 --> 02:08:48.854
TALIESIN: You earned that.

3271
02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:49.687
LIAM: Wow.

3272
02:08:49.687 --> 02:08:51.604
(laughter)

3273
02:08:52.607 --> 02:08:54.261
MATT: "I do."

3274
02:08:54.261 --> 02:08:55.349
LIAM: Fucking killer.

3275
02:08:55.349 --> 02:08:57.771
MARISHA: We were just curious.

3276
02:08:57.771 --> 02:09:00.038
Might get in contact with one of them.

3277
02:09:00.038 --> 02:09:01.440
Let them know about this cult thing.

3278
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:03.718
SAM: Not going to tell us.
MARISHA: Do you have the names?

3279
02:09:03.718 --> 02:09:05.955
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

3280
02:09:05.955 --> 02:09:06.863
MARISHA: Are you writing them down?

3281
02:09:06.863 --> 02:09:08.213
Is that what you're doing? You writing them down?

3282
02:09:08.213 --> 02:09:10.834
MATT: "No, I'm finishing my work."

3283
02:09:10.834 --> 02:09:15.834
SAM: You said before that you had work, that you had jobs.

3284
02:09:15.866 --> 02:09:19.232
Are those on the table, or you've retracted those jobs?

3285
02:09:19.232 --> 02:09:21.295
MATT: "I mean, yes, but it depends on what you think

3286
02:09:21.295 --> 02:09:23.556
"are more pressing matters.

3287
02:09:23.556 --> 02:09:25.773
"You seem to be racing towards

3288
02:09:25.773 --> 02:09:28.691
"these grandiose visions of being heroes

3289
02:09:28.691 --> 02:09:33.691
"running into the maw of terrible black devouring gods."

3290
02:09:33.757 --> 02:09:36.338
LAURA: Just the maws of like--

3291
02:09:36.338 --> 02:09:39.009
SAM: We can't do any of that without allies

3292
02:09:39.009 --> 02:09:42.242
and without information, you have both.

3293
02:09:42.242 --> 02:09:44.664
TALIESIN: Hopefully, we'll find out
what happened to that family.

3294
02:09:44.664 --> 02:09:46.885
TRAVIS: And sometimes a job can be rather revealing.

3295
02:09:46.885 --> 02:09:49.636
We'd be very interested in what you might

3296
02:09:49.636 --> 02:09:51.136
be in need of.

3297
02:09:52.704 --> 02:09:53.704
MATT: "All right.

3298
02:09:55.316 --> 02:09:57.860
"I have one shipment that's going up to Ophelia,

3299
02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:02.027
"in about a week, heading up toward Shadycreek Run.

3300
02:10:04.308 --> 02:10:09.308
"With the current war effort and the very watchful eye

3301
02:10:10.047 --> 02:10:12.846
"of the Righteous Brand and Crownsguard right now,

02:10:12.846 --> 02:10:14.548

02:10:14.548 --> 02:10:18.281
"by Kryn assassins or scouts,

"it's been difficult for us to move across the road,

3305
02:10:20.172 --> 02:10:23.263
"so basically, if you have your skillsets

3306
02:10:23.263 --> 02:10:28.263
"in deception and illusion, as you've displayed,

02:10:32.872 --> 02:10:36.238
"and not tied up in inspections.

02:10:37.455 --> 02:10:41.223

3311
02:10:46.316 --> 02:10:51.316
"let's see here, that will pay out 2500 gold pieces."

3312
02:10:51.645 --> 02:10:55.062
SAM: I don't think we're interested in gold.

3313
02:10:56.541 --> 02:10:58.036
LIAM: But if you feel like divulging the names

3314
02:10:58.036 --> 02:11:02.193
on that Council list, we could come to an arrangement.

3315
02:11:02.193 --> 02:11:04.962
SAM: Or other information that might be more pressing.

3316
02:11:04.962 --> 02:11:06.504
(laughter)

3317
02:11:06.504 --> 02:11:07.951
TRAVIS: We will certainly consider your offer,

3318
02:11:07.951 --> 02:11:09.925
and we thank you for the sanctuary.

3319
02:11:09.925 --> 02:11:13.023
MATT: "Of course."
MARISHA: We'll get back to you.

3320
02:11:13.023 --> 02:11:14.586
MATT: "Let's see, for what's opening there,

3321
02:11:14.586 --> 02:11:16.219
"I do have my guest chambers available."

3322
02:11:16.219 --> 02:11:18.845
He points behind you

3323
02:11:18.845 --> 02:11:20.315
and to the left of the room.

3324
02:11:20.315 --> 02:11:21.860
When you head down, there's the spiral staircase

3325
02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:25.072
that leads inside, and to the immediate right and up,

3326
02:11:25.072 --> 02:11:26.332
there's a balcony, and you can see

3327
02:11:26.332 --> 02:11:27.575
there is a bedroom up there,

3328
02:11:27.575 --> 02:11:28.983
and a small staircase underneath that leads up,

3329
02:11:28.983 --> 02:11:30.267
and he points to it and says--

3330
02:11:30.267 --> 02:11:33.965
TALIESIN: For the record, the assassin
can pass through stone,

3331
02:11:33.965 --> 02:11:37.690
and was jumping in and out of the floor.

3332
02:11:37.690 --> 02:11:39.800
MATT: "Then you're fucked."

3333
02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:42.920
TALIESIN: Yeah. Somewhat.

3334
02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:46.728
MATT: "So if it shows up, just please leave."

3335
02:11:46.728 --> 02:11:49.238
SAM: Sure.
TRAVIS: We'll remember that.

3336
02:11:49.238 --> 02:11:50.379
MATT: "Anyway."

3337
02:11:51.746 --> 02:11:54.074
TRAVIS: Thank you for your hospitality.

3338
02:11:54.074 --> 02:11:55.460
MATT: "Of course.

3339
02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:57.457
"Stay as long as you need.

3340
02:11:57.457 --> 02:11:59.978
"Food, drink, at your disposal, we are friends."

3341
02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:02.832
MARISHA: I need a drink.
SAM: Me, too.

3342
02:12:02.832 --> 02:12:05.499
MATT: "It's good to see you all safe."

3343
02:12:07.014 --> 02:12:09.179
TRAVIS: As we walk away, I walk over to Jester

3344
02:12:09.179 --> 02:12:12.234
and put a hand on her shoulder.

3345
02:12:12.234 --> 02:12:15.538
MARISHA: I lean on the other shoulder.

3346
02:12:15.538 --> 02:12:16.915
TRAVIS: You all right?

3347
02:12:16.915 --> 02:12:18.286
SAM: What'd you think?

3348
02:12:18.286 --> 02:12:20.068
Did you see the look in his eyes,

3349
02:12:20.068 --> 02:12:23.818
did you get anything, the glint, recognition?

3350
02:12:30.330 --> 02:12:32.043
LIAM: Caduceus.

3351
02:12:32.043 --> 02:12:34.042
What do you make of him?

3352
02:12:34.042 --> 02:12:36.501
TALIESIN: I'm still trying to figure it out.

3353
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:39.780
He is, even from my experience

3354
02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:44.122
with complicated individuals

3355
02:12:45.081 --> 02:12:47.844
and underworld types, and I have had some experience,

3356
02:12:47.844 --> 02:12:52.128
I haven't quite pinned down what I think yet.

3357
02:12:52.128 --> 02:12:55.162
LIAM: Well, he is literally a slippery one.

3358
02:12:55.162 --> 02:13:00.162
MARISHA: I mean, if he is your dad, fuck him, right?

3359
02:13:00.238 --> 02:13:01.470
Why do you want a relationship with someone

3360
02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:04.039
who doesn't want a relationship with you?

3361
02:13:04.039 --> 02:13:05.455
LAURA: That's true.

3362
02:13:05.455 --> 02:13:08.385
MARISHA: You're too good for him.

3363
02:13:08.385 --> 02:13:09.618
LAURA: Yeah.

3364
02:13:12.952 --> 02:13:15.775
SAM: If you knew he was your dad,

3365
02:13:15.775 --> 02:13:20.500
would you be proud of that, happy?

3366
02:13:22.796 --> 02:13:27.319
LAURA: I don't know, I was just happy that I knew, you know?

3367
02:13:27.319 --> 02:13:29.419
Mama seemed so sure.

3368
02:13:33.206 --> 02:13:34.422
(tearfully) But if he doesn't want me,

3369
02:13:34.422 --> 02:13:36.497
then I don't want him, it's fine.

3370
02:13:39.395 --> 02:13:42.145
MARISHA: I just wrap my arms around her.

3371
02:13:46.449 --> 02:13:48.532
TRAVIS: We're glad to have you.

3372
02:13:50.263 --> 02:13:52.069
LAURA: Thank you.

3373
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:53.736
I'm glad to be here.

3374
02:13:55.534 --> 02:13:58.765
MARISHA: Sometimes found family is better anyway.

3375
02:13:58.765 --> 02:14:00.387
TALIESIN: It's been nice.

3376
02:14:00.387 --> 02:14:03.406
MARISHA: My dad didn't want me either, so.

3377
02:14:03.406 --> 02:14:05.546
LAURA: Fuck them.
MARISHA: Fuck them.

3378
02:14:05.546 --> 02:14:06.853
SAM: Well, I mean--

3379
02:14:06.853 --> 02:14:08.131
MARISHA: No, fuck them.

3380
02:14:08.131 --> 02:14:12.631
SAM: Well, if he is your dad, he's not bad.

3381
02:14:13.539 --> 02:14:17.122
He even said he hardly ever human traffics.

3382
02:14:18.151 --> 02:14:20.318
I mean, that's principles.

3383
02:14:21.222 --> 02:14:24.166
He could human traffic all the time.

3384
02:14:24.166 --> 02:14:25.384
LAURA: That's why I asked.

3385
02:14:25.384 --> 02:14:26.597
I was like, if he is my dad,

3386
02:14:26.597 --> 02:14:28.350
I just don't want him to do slaves.
TALIESIN: Oh.

3387
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:30.852
SAM: He doesn't, mostly.

3388
02:14:30.852 --> 02:14:31.834
MARISHA: What?

3389
02:14:31.834 --> 02:14:32.836
TALIESIN: I just figured out what that meant,

3390
02:14:32.836 --> 02:14:34.109
I was just putting that together.

3391
02:14:34.109 --> 02:14:38.526
Sorry, I was thinking about carts, anyway.

3392
02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:41.846
MATT: Real fast, just because it's easier

3393
02:14:41.846 --> 02:14:44.950
than me having to get up, just close your ears.

3394
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:46.529
Cup your ears.

3395
02:14:46.529 --> 02:14:47.864
Everybody but Caduceus.

3396
02:14:47.864 --> 02:14:49.852
SAM: Oh!

3397
02:14:49.852 --> 02:14:52.484
LIAM: (Rick voice) What do you mean?! Ah!

3398
02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:55.339
MATT: While this conversation's happening,

3399
02:14:55.339 --> 02:14:58.056
you can see that the Gentleman is,

3400
02:14:58.056 --> 02:14:59.487
while head down in his work,

3401
02:14:59.487 --> 02:15:02.582
his eyes are very clearly trained on the group.

3402
02:15:02.582 --> 02:15:05.525
Yeah, all right, we're good.

3403
02:15:05.525 --> 02:15:06.835
SAM: What just happened?

3404
02:15:06.835 --> 02:15:08.335
TALIESIN: Stuff for later.

3405
02:15:09.614 --> 02:15:13.190
MATT: All right, so you have drinks readily available,

3406
02:15:13.190 --> 02:15:15.845
the bartender serves them up.

3407
02:15:15.845 --> 02:15:17.884
Some people come, some people go,

3408
02:15:17.884 --> 02:15:20.696
most everyone leaves you to your own business,

3409
02:15:20.696 --> 02:15:22.788
and they wish to be left to their own.

3410
02:15:22.788 --> 02:15:26.368
You watch as the Gentleman gives out payment

3411
02:15:26.368 --> 02:15:28.985
to the employees, each one stepping forward

3412
02:15:28.985 --> 02:15:32.271
and being handed their pay before he goes

3413
02:15:32.271 --> 02:15:36.523
and requests that one of the finer bottles of wine,

3414
02:15:36.523 --> 02:15:39.509
brought in from Feolinn, is given to you.

3415
02:15:39.509 --> 02:15:41.010
MARISHA: I'll look at it real quick.

3416
02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:42.008
It's a good wine?

3417
02:15:42.008 --> 02:15:42.982
MATT: It's actually pretty good.

3418
02:15:42.982 --> 02:15:44.143
It grows in the plum groves.

3419
02:15:44.143 --> 02:15:46.127
Feolinn's like, from the Menagerie Coast,

3420
02:15:46.127 --> 02:15:47.719
one of the wine spots.

3421
02:15:47.719 --> 02:15:48.910
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine.

3422
02:15:48.910 --> 02:15:49.840
TRAVIS: Is it made from grapes?

3423
02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:50.770
SAM: I'm not going to drink it.

3424
02:15:50.770 --> 02:15:52.700
You want a whiskey?

3425
02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:53.533
MARISHA: Yeah.

3426
02:15:53.533 --> 02:15:55.283
SAM: I'll go to the bar with Beau.

3427
02:15:55.283 --> 02:15:59.309
MARISHA: I take a swig from the bottle, take it with me.

3428
02:15:59.309 --> 02:16:00.554
SAM: I'll get a couple whiskeys.
MARISHA: Oh, me and you

3429
02:16:00.554 --> 02:16:01.571
going to the bar?

3430
02:16:01.571 --> 02:16:02.741
All right.

3431
02:16:02.741 --> 02:16:03.574
MATT: Okay.

3432
02:16:04.726 --> 02:16:05.722
Is there anything you guys want to do,

3433
02:16:05.722 --> 02:16:07.493
or are you just bedding up for the night to rest?

3434
02:16:07.493 --> 02:16:09.138
LIAM: Could I have a milk, please?

3435
02:16:09.138 --> 02:16:11.550
MATT: (laughs) The guy behind goes, "(grunts)

3436
02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:13.597
Yeah, I'll get you milk."

3437
02:16:13.597 --> 02:16:15.160
SAM: Little whiskey for the cat.

3438
02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:16.243
TRAVIS: Smell that.

3439
02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:18.796
Uh-oh, no!

3440
02:16:18.796 --> 02:16:20.919
MATT: Pours it, it's a little thick.

3441
02:16:20.919 --> 02:16:22.878
(laughter)

3442
02:16:22.878 --> 02:16:24.797
MATT: Slides it over.

3443
02:16:24.797 --> 02:16:26.982
LIAM: I bring it over and set it down in front of Jester

3444
02:16:26.982 --> 02:16:31.516
and sit across from her at a table, and say:

3445
02:16:34.337 --> 02:16:36.087
a parent is a parent.

3446
02:16:37.191 --> 02:16:38.663
Everybody's different,

3447
02:16:38.663 --> 02:16:43.413
but sometimes, it's hard to write them off.

3448
02:16:47.050 --> 02:16:48.550
Give it some time.

3449
02:16:51.838 --> 02:16:53.313
TALIESIN: If everyone's busy,

3450
02:16:53.313 --> 02:16:55.018
I'm going to take a pot of tea over

3451
02:16:55.018 --> 02:16:59.101
and see if the Gentleman would like a pot of tea.

3452
02:17:00.222 --> 02:17:02.691
I'm going to get some hot water and make my own tea.

3453
02:17:02.691 --> 02:17:03.524
MATT: Okay.

3454
02:17:04.912 --> 02:17:06.436
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine."

3455
02:17:06.436 --> 02:17:07.853
TALIESIN: It's very rare.

3456
02:17:08.721 --> 02:17:09.694
MATT: "How rare?"

3457
02:17:09.694 --> 02:17:12.777
TALIESIN: Only comes from the Blooming Grove.

3458
02:17:14.177 --> 02:17:17.859
I actually was hoping to ask a favor.

3459
02:17:17.859 --> 02:17:20.063
Have you heard of the Blooming Grove?

3460
02:17:20.063 --> 02:17:20.896
MATT: "I've heard of it, yeah,

3461
02:17:20.896 --> 02:17:23.581
"it's a little ways out of Shadycreek.

3462
02:17:23.581 --> 02:17:25.237
"It's a graveyard."

3463
02:17:25.237 --> 02:17:28.213
TALIESIN: It's much more than that, but yes.

3464
02:17:28.213 --> 02:17:31.229
MATT: "All right, bring me a bit. I'm curious."

3465
02:17:31.229 --> 02:17:32.579
TALIESIN: I pour.

3466
02:17:32.579 --> 02:17:36.175
My family has been watching over the Blooming Grove

3467
02:17:36.175 --> 02:17:41.175
since it was created. We were the ones who planted

3468
02:17:41.867 --> 02:17:44.731
the first body beneath it,

3469
02:17:44.731 --> 02:17:47.361
and we have worked very hard to maintain it,

3470
02:17:47.361 --> 02:17:52.194
and it is dying from something.

3471
02:17:53.288 --> 02:17:56.418
Would it be possible to have someone check in on it

3472
02:17:56.418 --> 02:17:58.309
and report back, would it be possible

3473
02:17:58.309 --> 02:18:03.129
to have some news of if it still stands,

3474
02:18:03.129 --> 02:18:04.595
if it's holding fast?

3475
02:18:04.595 --> 02:18:06.178
My family had to...

3476
02:18:09.219 --> 02:18:10.267
I don't know where they are,

3477
02:18:10.267 --> 02:18:12.636
and I don't know if they're okay,

3478
02:18:12.636 --> 02:18:16.259
and it's been a long time, and

3479
02:18:17.393 --> 02:18:21.159
there is a part of me that is very lonely.

3480
02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:24.655
MATT: Make a persuasion check, with advantage.

3481
02:18:28.706 --> 02:18:30.733
TALIESIN: Persuasion, 16.

3482
02:18:30.733 --> 02:18:31.787
MATT: 16.

3483
02:18:31.787 --> 02:18:33.537
He takes another sip.

3484
02:18:38.395 --> 02:18:39.978
"I can arrange that."

3485
02:18:42.306 --> 02:18:44.707
TALIESIN: I'll gladly leave you some tea,

3486
02:18:44.707 --> 02:18:46.643
if not for yourself, to impress somebody

3487
02:18:46.643 --> 02:18:49.133
who might be impressed by such things.

3488
02:18:49.133 --> 02:18:50.827
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, it's delightfully musty.

3489
02:18:50.827 --> 02:18:53.251
"I wasn't expecting that."

3490
02:18:53.251 --> 02:18:55.751
TALIESIN: I apologize, I'm a little--

3491
02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:59.954
Family is so complicated, and

3492
02:19:00.937 --> 02:19:03.253
I was cruel, on occasion,

3493
02:19:03.253 --> 02:19:05.694
to my siblings, and

3494
02:19:07.594 --> 02:19:09.769
not as honest with my parents as I wish I could've been,

3495
02:19:09.769 --> 02:19:12.914
but it is a unique

3496
02:19:12.914 --> 02:19:17.914
and exquisite complication,

3497
02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:19.113
family.

3498
02:19:20.366 --> 02:19:23.199
MATT: "I know I've had my knocks growing up.

3499
02:19:23.199 --> 02:19:26.877
"A brother I don't care to speak of anymore, or speak to."

3500
02:19:26.877 --> 02:19:28.753
TALIESIN: Well, I'm just saying.

3501
02:19:28.753 --> 02:19:31.077
You should tell her.

3502
02:19:31.077 --> 02:19:34.577
I think it would do you good, both of you.

3503
02:19:36.936 --> 02:19:38.936
MATT: "Thank you for the tea."

3504
02:19:41.358 --> 02:19:44.941
LIAM: I had one last sentence, two minutes ago.

3505
02:19:46.803 --> 02:19:51.803
I'm sorry that your father has not been a part of your life.

3506
02:19:52.423 --> 02:19:55.173
He is the one who has missed out.

3507
02:19:58.468 --> 02:19:59.301
LAURA: Thank you, Caleb.
LIAM: And I drink

3508
02:19:59.301 --> 02:20:01.202
half of the milk, and it's really bad.

3509
02:20:01.202 --> 02:20:05.346
LAURA: It's really bad, Caleb, it smelled really terrible.

3510
02:20:05.346 --> 02:20:07.754
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

3511
02:20:12.404 --> 02:20:15.560
TRAVIS: Please spray rotten milk
all over the Gentleman's bar.

3512
02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.107
LIAM: It is a seven.

3513
02:20:17.107 --> 02:20:18.018
MATT: A seven?

3514
02:20:18.018 --> 02:20:22.748
So you drink it, and just immediately (spits)

3515
02:20:22.748 --> 02:20:23.881
on the counter.

3516
02:20:23.881 --> 02:20:26.836
Not like a full vomit, but you just spit it back up

3517
02:20:26.836 --> 02:20:28.713
immediately, and just like, oh.

3518
02:20:28.713 --> 02:20:31.671
LIAM: (choked) It's good you didn't drink it.

3519
02:20:31.671 --> 02:20:34.137
LAURA: I take the rag from my dress

3520
02:20:34.137 --> 02:20:36.137
and just wipe Caleb's mouth.

3521
02:20:37.008 --> 02:20:38.327
Thank you.

3522
02:20:38.327 --> 02:20:40.089
TRAVIS: Frumpkin comes, starts licking the milk.

3523
02:20:40.089 --> 02:20:41.612
LAURA: Don't drink it, Frumpkin!
TRAVIS: (poofing sound)

3524
02:20:41.612 --> 02:20:45.295
(laughter)

3525
02:20:47.911 --> 02:20:49.379
MARISHA: Am I still at the bar with Nott?

3526
02:20:49.379 --> 02:20:50.212
MATT: Yeah.

3527
02:20:53.234 --> 02:20:55.530
SAM: Ah!
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good.

3528
02:20:55.530 --> 02:20:56.363
Another.

3529
02:20:59.831 --> 02:21:02.648
SAM: Got any lime and salt?

3530
02:21:02.648 --> 02:21:04.566
MATT: "No lime. Salt."

3531
02:21:04.566 --> 02:21:06.642
And he pulls a pouch of salt.

3532
02:21:06.642 --> 02:21:08.538
TALIESIN: I have some of the rotten hallucinogenic fruit

3533
02:21:08.538 --> 02:21:09.655
that we took that one time,

3534
02:21:09.655 --> 02:21:11.694
you could rub that on the rim.

3535
02:21:11.694 --> 02:21:13.194
SAM: One, two, three.

3536
02:21:14.924 --> 02:21:17.372
(exhales)

3537
02:21:17.372 --> 02:21:18.288
MARISHA: Have you thought about that secret

3538
02:21:18.288 --> 02:21:19.213
you were going to tell me?

3539
02:21:19.213 --> 02:21:20.046
SAM: I'm sorry, what?

3540
02:21:20.046 --> 02:21:23.096
MARISHA: Have you thought about that secret
you were going to tell me?

3541
02:21:23.096 --> 02:21:24.771
SAM: Oh, we're still doing that thing?

3542
02:21:24.771 --> 02:21:26.054
MARISHA: Confide.

3543
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:29.650
SAM: It really looks from your eyes

3544
02:21:29.650 --> 02:21:33.633
like you've been thinking about this. (laughs)

3545
02:21:33.633 --> 02:21:36.677
TRAVIS: Been a week, surely you have. (laughs)

3546
02:21:36.677 --> 02:21:37.677
SAM: All right.

3547
02:21:38.839 --> 02:21:40.365
One more round.

3548
02:21:40.365 --> 02:21:41.714
MARISHA: Okay.

3549
02:21:41.714 --> 02:21:43.131
SAM: Who goes first?

3550
02:21:44.648 --> 02:21:46.410
MARISHA: Do we go at the same time?

3551
02:21:46.410 --> 02:21:48.810
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: Or should we flip for it?

3552
02:21:48.810 --> 02:21:50.893
SAM: Ooh, let's flip for it.

3553
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:54.184
What do we flip?
MARISHA: I don't know.

3554
02:21:54.184 --> 02:21:56.353
A coin that I don't have.

3555
02:21:56.353 --> 02:21:57.186
Ah!

3556
02:21:58.945 --> 02:22:01.010
Ooh, yeah, oh, perfect.

3557
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:02.275
This is awesome.

3558
02:22:02.275 --> 02:22:04.048
Okay, ready?
TALIESIN: Oh, that too.

3559
02:22:04.048 --> 02:22:05.377
TRAVIS: Number or not?

3560
02:22:05.377 --> 02:22:07.181
MARISHA: Heads or tails?
SAM: Tails.

3561
02:22:07.181 --> 02:22:09.829
MARISHA: Tails. Wait, tails you go first?
SAM: You go first!

3562
02:22:09.829 --> 02:22:11.569
MARISHA: Or tails you get to choose?

3563
02:22:11.569 --> 02:22:12.481
SAM: Tails you get to choose.

3564
02:22:12.481 --> 02:22:13.877
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: I get to choose.

3565
02:22:13.877 --> 02:22:15.068
MARISHA: All right.

3566
02:22:15.068 --> 02:22:18.151
SAM: I'm drunk, oh, that was a big flip.

3567
02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:20.733
TALIESIN: You don't have enough dinners.

3568
02:22:20.733 --> 02:22:21.967
MARISHA: Natural 20.

3569
02:22:21.967 --> 02:22:23.584
Or, it's the heads.

3570
02:22:23.584 --> 02:22:25.948
Sorry, it's a kraken.

3571
02:22:25.948 --> 02:22:26.781
It was a kraken symbol.

3572
02:22:26.781 --> 02:22:27.937
SAM: What does that mean?
MARISHA: Heads.

3573
02:22:27.937 --> 02:22:29.643
SAM: You get to choose.
MARISHA: I get to choose.

3574
02:22:29.643 --> 02:22:30.601
You go first.

3575
02:22:30.601 --> 02:22:31.627
LIAM: Listen to me.

3576
02:22:31.627 --> 02:22:33.539
Stay in your personal sphere

3577
02:22:33.539 --> 02:22:36.376
when you are playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

3578
02:22:36.376 --> 02:22:37.679
Stay here.

3579
02:22:37.679 --> 02:22:38.767
MARISHA: Fuck you, you're not here.

3580
02:22:38.767 --> 02:22:40.585
LIAM: Put your arm away from my face!

3581
02:22:40.585 --> 02:22:42.886
(laughter)

3582
02:22:42.886 --> 02:22:43.886
SAM: All right.

3583
02:22:45.686 --> 02:22:50.103
(slurps) It's a little embarrassing.

3584
02:22:51.383 --> 02:22:53.339
MARISHA: Another one.

3585
02:22:53.339 --> 02:22:55.747
SAM: But when I was in that prison cell

3586
02:22:55.747 --> 02:23:00.072
with Widogast over there,

3587
02:23:00.072 --> 02:23:01.597
for the first few days,

3588
02:23:04.514 --> 02:23:07.322
I was kind of attracted to him.

3589
02:23:08.725 --> 02:23:11.211
I mean, he was filthy, obviously,

3590
02:23:11.211 --> 02:23:14.311
and very-- I mean, he smelled awful.

3591
02:23:15.790 --> 02:23:18.707
TRAVIS: Oh, the dagger.

3592
02:23:21.029 --> 02:23:23.331
SAM: I just saw him one night,

3593
02:23:23.331 --> 02:23:26.377
sort of trying to look out the window,

3594
02:23:26.377 --> 02:23:29.075
the moonlight was hitting his face, and

3595
02:23:30.792 --> 02:23:33.261
he was very handsome.

3596
02:23:33.261 --> 02:23:36.048
MARISHA: You know, I kind of got that vibe before,

3597
02:23:36.048 --> 02:23:39.450
thought there might be that feeling.

3598
02:23:39.450 --> 02:23:42.446
SAM: Had a little bit of a crush.

3599
02:23:42.446 --> 02:23:44.843
But then I got to know him.

3600
02:23:44.843 --> 02:23:46.676
MARISHA: And friend zone?

3601
02:23:46.676 --> 02:23:51.331
SAM: Well, I mean, I'm also married, happily married,

3602
02:23:51.331 --> 02:23:54.630
but I will say I haven't looked at another man

3603
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:58.265
other than my husband quite like that.

3604
02:23:58.265 --> 02:24:01.573
He's very exciting.

3605
02:24:04.716 --> 02:24:07.301
In another world, maybe.

3606
02:24:07.301 --> 02:24:10.617
MARISHA: Yeah, another time, another place.

3607
02:24:10.617 --> 02:24:12.483
SAM: Dish the dish, bish!

3608
02:24:12.483 --> 02:24:14.816
(laughter)

3609
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:18.291
MARISHA: I might have a similar problem.

3610
02:24:18.291 --> 02:24:20.587
SAM: Wait, you're into Caleb, too?

3611
02:24:20.587 --> 02:24:21.987
MARISHA: No! No!
SAM: Gross!

3612
02:24:21.987 --> 02:24:23.244
SAM: Gross, he's filthy and disgusting!

3613
02:24:23.244 --> 02:24:24.327
MARISHA: No, not Caleb!

3614
02:24:24.327 --> 02:24:25.535
SAM: Oh, who?

3615
02:24:28.154 --> 02:24:30.037
<i>Me</i>?!
MARISHA: No!

3616
02:24:30.037 --> 02:24:31.567
SAM: Oh, it's me!

3617
02:24:31.567 --> 02:24:33.851
It's your way of telling me!

3618
02:24:33.851 --> 02:24:35.105
MARISHA: Shut up, shut up! It's Jester.

3619
02:24:35.105 --> 02:24:36.493
SAM: Wait, what?

3620
02:24:36.493 --> 02:24:38.873
I'm sorry, what??

3621
02:24:38.873 --> 02:24:39.788
(whispering) I'm sorry, what?

3622
02:24:39.788 --> 02:24:40.763
MARISHA: It's just kind of, I don't know.

3623
02:24:40.763 --> 02:24:44.858
It's just a crush, I just don't know what to do with it.

3624
02:24:44.858 --> 02:24:47.390
SAM: Wait, <i>what</i>?

3625
02:24:47.390 --> 02:24:48.539
What?

3626
02:24:48.539 --> 02:24:50.231
Three more! Three more rounds.

3627
02:24:50.231 --> 02:24:51.589
MARISHA: Three more each.

3628
02:24:52.911 --> 02:24:54.174
If you fucking tell anybody--

3629
02:24:54.174 --> 02:24:55.233
SAM: Of course I'm not going to tell anyone.

3630
02:24:55.233 --> 02:24:57.087
You know, look at this face.

3631
02:24:57.087 --> 02:24:58.845
MARISHA: You tell everybody everything.

3632
02:24:58.845 --> 02:25:00.711
LIAM: (high-pitched laugh)

3633
02:25:00.711 --> 02:25:02.604
SAM: I'm cool!

3634
02:25:02.604 --> 02:25:04.065
MARISHA: You are going to let it slip!

3635
02:25:04.065 --> 02:25:05.384
SAM: No, of course not.

3636
02:25:05.384 --> 02:25:06.746
MARISHA: I shouldn't have told you.

3637
02:25:06.746 --> 02:25:09.076
SAM: Wait, what about her?

3638
02:25:09.076 --> 02:25:13.747
For me, it's his rugged jawline,

3639
02:25:13.747 --> 02:25:15.439
it's his intellect.

3640
02:25:15.439 --> 02:25:16.272
MARISHA: Are you talking about Caleb again?

3641
02:25:16.272 --> 02:25:17.105
SAM: Yes.

3642
02:25:18.012 --> 02:25:21.236
It's his "I don't care about the world,

3643
02:25:21.236 --> 02:25:22.852
"I don't care how people look at me,

3644
02:25:22.852 --> 02:25:24.472
"I don't care how I present myself."

3645
02:25:24.472 --> 02:25:25.729
I like that.

3646
02:25:25.729 --> 02:25:28.354
It's sort of interesting and confident.

3647
02:25:28.354 --> 02:25:30.104
What is it about her?

3648
02:25:33.023 --> 02:25:36.323
MARISHA: She's fun, she makes me laugh,

3649
02:25:37.275 --> 02:25:39.608
I like her ridiculous plans.

3650
02:25:41.497 --> 02:25:44.922
I think she's complicated and layered.

3651
02:25:47.661 --> 02:25:49.011
I don't know.

3652
02:25:51.054 --> 02:25:52.221
SAM: That's cool.

3653
02:25:53.916 --> 02:25:57.868
MARISHA: I'm not going to act on it or anything.

3654
02:25:57.868 --> 02:26:00.110
SAM: I wouldn't have thought she's your type.

3655
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:04.640
MARISHA: I don't think she thinks that I'm her type.

3656
02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:07.016
SAM: You're not serious though about this,

3657
02:26:07.016 --> 02:26:07.873
this is a crush,

3658
02:26:07.873 --> 02:26:09.605
this is not a thing--
MARISHA: Yeah, of course!

3659
02:26:09.605 --> 02:26:11.532
SAM: --that you're going to actually pursue, right?

3660
02:26:11.532 --> 02:26:14.628
MARISHA: Yeah!
SAM: Because I don't know if--

3661
02:26:14.628 --> 02:26:18.856
Wow, but what if-- she doesn't know anything.

3662
02:26:18.856 --> 02:26:19.689
Hey, have you noticed

3663
02:26:19.689 --> 02:26:21.724
that she doesn't know anything about herself?

3664
02:26:21.724 --> 02:26:24.195
Like she doesn't know who she is,

3665
02:26:24.195 --> 02:26:26.049
she doesn't know what she likes.

3666
02:26:26.049 --> 02:26:28.289
MARISHA: I've had that fantasy.

3667
02:26:28.289 --> 02:26:32.542
SAM: She could be lost, she could be a sea right now,

3668
02:26:32.542 --> 02:26:37.246
and you could be the anchor that brings her home.

3669
02:26:37.246 --> 02:26:39.726
MARISHA: I could be the flame in the darkness.
LIAM: I don't think that's how anchors work.

3670
02:26:39.726 --> 02:26:42.022
TALIESIN: Anchor brings you to the bottom, if I recall.

3671
02:26:42.022 --> 02:26:45.496
Be the anchor that brings her to the bottom.

3672
02:26:45.496 --> 02:26:49.672
SAM: What if she's lost because she doesn't know

3673
02:26:49.672 --> 02:26:51.187
that you're what she's looking for.

3674
02:26:51.187 --> 02:26:52.759
She thinks she likes Fjord.

3675
02:26:52.759 --> 02:26:55.387
MARISHA: I could be her beacon.

3676
02:26:55.387 --> 02:26:57.438
I need to stop saying these things.

3677
02:26:57.438 --> 02:27:01.285
No, these aren't any of these things.

3678
02:27:01.285 --> 02:27:03.207
It's just this-- I'm already--

3679
02:27:03.207 --> 02:27:05.446
SAM: I didn't even consider that as a possibility.

3680
02:27:05.446 --> 02:27:06.801
MARISHA: It's not a possibility.

3681
02:27:06.801 --> 02:27:08.663
SAM: But maybe it is.
MARISHA: No.

3682
02:27:08.663 --> 02:27:09.496
SAM: Don't worry.

3683
02:27:09.496 --> 02:27:10.999
I'll do some work.
MARISHA: No!

3684
02:27:10.999 --> 02:27:14.605
(laughter)

3685
02:27:14.605 --> 02:27:15.638
MARISHA: No!

3686
02:27:15.638 --> 02:27:18.171
SAM: I'll find something I can do here.

3687
02:27:18.171 --> 02:27:22.598
MARISHA: Nott, confiding! This was an exercise in confiding.

3688
02:27:22.598 --> 02:27:26.448
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3689
02:27:30.625 --> 02:27:32.302
SAM: I see what you're getting at.

3690
02:27:32.302 --> 02:27:34.424
(laughter)

3691
02:27:34.424 --> 02:27:36.696
TALIESIN: Got a dating sim mini-game, fuck yes.

3692
02:27:36.696 --> 02:27:38.266
MARISHA: It's very black and white,

3693
02:27:38.266 --> 02:27:39.663
it's just don't tell the secrets.

3694
02:27:39.663 --> 02:27:41.290
It's not that I'm getting at anything,

3695
02:27:41.290 --> 02:27:43.809
it's just that this stays between you and me.

3696
02:27:43.809 --> 02:27:46.809
This is our girl thing, okay?
SAM: Okay.

3697
02:27:48.099 --> 02:27:49.077
MARISHA: Yeah?

3698
02:27:49.077 --> 02:27:50.738
Chaos Crew?

3699
02:27:50.738 --> 02:27:51.970
SAM: Chaos Crew.

3700
02:27:51.970 --> 02:27:53.004
MARISHA: Link Cs.

3701
02:27:53.004 --> 02:27:54.345
SAM: What is this, what're you doing?

3702
02:27:54.345 --> 02:27:55.435
MARISHA: I'm making a pact.

3703
02:27:55.435 --> 02:27:57.365
SAM: Oh, CC, it happened!

3704
02:27:57.365 --> 02:27:58.198
MARISHA: I did it.

3705
02:27:58.198 --> 02:28:00.019
(laughter)

3706
02:28:00.019 --> 02:28:01.508
SAM: That was cool!

3707
02:28:01.508 --> 02:28:03.469
MARISHA: Thank you, I invented it just now.

3708
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:05.497
SAM: Wow, that was good.

3709
02:28:05.497 --> 02:28:08.118
Hey, but no matter what,

3710
02:28:08.118 --> 02:28:10.139
we're not letting this break up the three of us.

3711
02:28:10.139 --> 02:28:12.771
MARISHA: No, absolutely not.

3712
02:28:12.771 --> 02:28:15.729
Chaos Crew, ride or die.

3713
02:28:16.723 --> 02:28:17.874
It's not going to change anything.

3714
02:28:17.874 --> 02:28:18.707
SAM: No.

3715
02:28:19.777 --> 02:28:21.155
MARISHA: Don't let it change anything.

3716
02:28:21.155 --> 02:28:22.519
SAM: It won't.

3717
02:28:22.519 --> 02:28:25.368
I will behave the same.

3718
02:28:25.368 --> 02:28:29.755
MARISHA: You're already not.
SAM: Cool as a cucumber.

3719
02:28:29.755 --> 02:28:33.755
MARISHA: Oh my god, I do all three of the shots.

3720
02:28:35.264 --> 02:28:36.549
SAM: All right, I'll walk back over.

3721
02:28:36.549 --> 02:28:37.515
MATT: All right.

3722
02:28:37.515 --> 02:28:40.130
You guys all bedding down for the night?

3723
02:28:40.130 --> 02:28:40.963
Okay.

3724
02:28:42.936 --> 02:28:44.943
LAURA: What?
SAM: Nothing.

3725
02:28:44.943 --> 02:28:46.477
MARISHA: I just fucking throw a coin at Nott.

3726
02:28:46.477 --> 02:28:48.061
SAM: Oh, fuck, my ear!

3727
02:28:48.061 --> 02:28:51.020
(laughter)

3728
02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:51.996
MATT: All right, are you guys planning

3729
02:28:51.996 --> 02:28:53.083
to crash here tonight then?

3730
02:28:53.083 --> 02:28:54.388
ALL: Yeah.

3731
02:28:54.388 --> 02:28:58.180
MATT: You all go to bedroom.

3732
02:28:59.590 --> 02:29:01.244
LAURA: We all go to bedroom.

3733
02:29:01.244 --> 02:29:02.803
(laughter)

3734
02:29:02.803 --> 02:29:05.246
MARISHA: Sorry, I didn't mean to
invade your space for secrets.

3735
02:29:05.246 --> 02:29:06.079
LIAM: Huh?

3736
02:29:06.079 --> 02:29:07.745
No, just don't punch me in the face.

3737
02:29:07.745 --> 02:29:09.444
MARISHA: I'm not going to punch you in the face.

3738
02:29:09.444 --> 02:29:11.194
I'm not that unaware.

3739
02:29:13.237 --> 02:29:14.640
SAM: Mostly.

3740
02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:18.774
MATT: So there are five beds,

3741
02:29:18.774 --> 02:29:22.907
so people have to either double up or get on the floor,

3742
02:29:22.907 --> 02:29:24.002
but there are cushions everywhere,

3743
02:29:24.002 --> 02:29:26.369
so you can make a makeshift bed on the floor.

3744
02:29:29.911 --> 02:29:31.202
Just make a perception check.

3745
02:29:31.202 --> 02:29:32.843
SAM: Oh, shit.

3746
02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:36.219
Oh god, it's not the assassin again.

3747
02:29:36.219 --> 02:29:37.727
LAURA: Please don't be the assassin.

3748
02:29:37.727 --> 02:29:39.311
Ooh.

3749
02:29:39.311 --> 02:29:40.426
20.

3750
02:29:40.426 --> 02:29:41.651
MATT: 20.

3751
02:29:45.719 --> 02:29:50.709
You have a sense that something is off,

3752
02:29:50.709 --> 02:29:52.928
and you come in the middle of the night,

3753
02:29:52.928 --> 02:29:54.452
maybe, you have no idea what hour it is,

3754
02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:57.202
but everyone else is dead asleep.

3755
02:29:58.177 --> 02:29:59.551
LIAM: (sighs)

3756
02:29:59.551 --> 02:30:00.474
MATT: Yes, Caleb?
LIAM: I didn't realize

3757
02:30:00.474 --> 02:30:01.904
we were going to stop, I was about to say,

3758
02:30:01.904 --> 02:30:04.438
who's taking first watch?

3759
02:30:04.438 --> 02:30:07.389
Caleb's already said, we're never going to sleep

3760
02:30:07.389 --> 02:30:09.722
without somebody awake ever again.
LAURA: I took first watch.

3761
02:30:09.722 --> 02:30:11.707
TALIESIN: You can take first watch.

3762
02:30:11.707 --> 02:30:14.721
TRAVIS: The dome is up in the room?

3763
02:30:14.721 --> 02:30:18.911
LIAM: Dome is worthless for this woman.

3764
02:30:18.911 --> 02:30:19.911
TALIESIN: Just wire.

3765
02:30:20.984 --> 02:30:22.196
MATT: So on your watch,

3766
02:30:22.196 --> 02:30:25.688
you're starting to nod off a little bit.

3767
02:30:25.688 --> 02:30:27.784
Just a little bit, and you catch yourself,

3768
02:30:27.784 --> 02:30:28.713
and you have this weird sense,

3769
02:30:28.713 --> 02:30:32.104
and you glance over, and at the curtains

3770
02:30:32.104 --> 02:30:34.604
that are drawn at the balcony,

3771
02:30:35.861 --> 02:30:37.476
where the steps lead up,

3772
02:30:37.476 --> 02:30:41.255
you see a figure just looking in,

3773
02:30:41.255 --> 02:30:42.434
and as soon as you straighten up,

3774
02:30:42.434 --> 02:30:46.111
the figure (whooshes) ducks around the side.

3775
02:30:46.111 --> 02:30:49.239
LAURA: Could I see what the figure looked like?

3776
02:30:49.239 --> 02:30:51.729
MATT: From what you can see, it's kind of back-lit,

3777
02:30:51.729 --> 02:30:53.184
because there's no light really in the inside

3778
02:30:53.184 --> 02:30:54.729
of the room you're in, or much.

3779
02:30:54.729 --> 02:30:55.571
Most of the light's coming to the inside,

3780
02:30:55.571 --> 02:30:58.046
so just the outline, just a bit of figure

3781
02:30:58.046 --> 02:31:01.838
peeking in, and they vanish around the corner.

3782
02:31:01.838 --> 02:31:02.703
LAURA: I hit everyone.

3783
02:31:02.703 --> 02:31:03.626
SAM: No!

3784
02:31:03.626 --> 02:31:05.542
LAURA: There's somebody there.

3785
02:31:05.542 --> 02:31:07.018
I go and peek out the door.

3786
02:31:07.018 --> 02:31:08.425
MATT: You peek out the door?

3787
02:31:08.425 --> 02:31:09.729
You look out the edge, and you can see,

3788
02:31:09.729 --> 02:31:13.075
walking towards the bar, the room itself is fairly empty

3789
02:31:13.075 --> 02:31:16.133
except for the ogre bodyguard,

3790
02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:20.393
but you see, briskly walking to the bar, the Gentleman.

3791
02:31:20.393 --> 02:31:21.846
SAM: Oh, he was the one?

3792
02:31:21.846 --> 02:31:22.867
MATT: You gather that he was probably the one

3793
02:31:22.867 --> 02:31:24.450
who was looking in.

3794
02:31:25.783 --> 02:31:27.971
LAURA: Nevermind, nothing, go to sleep.

3795
02:31:27.971 --> 02:31:30.328
Then I go chase him down.

3796
02:31:30.328 --> 02:31:31.606
MATT: Okay.

3797
02:31:31.606 --> 02:31:35.228
As you start descending the steps, he looks up at you,

3798
02:31:35.228 --> 02:31:38.871
and you see this, he puts a second glass of wine,

3799
02:31:38.871 --> 02:31:40.873
or puts a glass up onto the counter,

3800
02:31:40.873 --> 02:31:42.956
and he begins to pour it.

3801
02:31:46.602 --> 02:31:47.935
LAURA: I go sit down.

3802
02:31:49.274 --> 02:31:52.888
MATT: Slides the glass over to you, takes his,

3803
02:31:52.888 --> 02:31:54.847
not even looking at you. He's just looking ahead,

3804
02:31:54.847 --> 02:31:57.597
sitting next to you, takes a sip.

3805
02:32:00.197 --> 02:32:03.072
"How is she? Marion."

3806
02:32:03.072 --> 02:32:04.572
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3807
02:32:09.727 --> 02:32:12.987
LAURA: So you do know her. (sighs)

3808
02:32:14.279 --> 02:32:15.454
MATT: "Once.

3809
02:32:17.726 --> 02:32:20.859
"(sighs)"

3810
02:32:22.569 --> 02:32:24.152
LAURA: Did you love her?

3811
02:32:26.337 --> 02:32:27.612
MATT: "Yeah."

3812
02:32:32.277 --> 02:32:35.602
Looks over, and gives another shoo motion to the ogre,

3813
02:32:35.602 --> 02:32:38.227
who (grunts) leaves the room

3814
02:32:38.227 --> 02:32:40.451
and heads into one of the back open archway

3815
02:32:40.451 --> 02:32:42.299
and closes the door, so it's just the two of you

3816
02:32:42.299 --> 02:32:44.716
in the chamber, definitively.

3817
02:32:54.658 --> 02:32:55.883
LAURA: Why did you leave?

3818
02:32:55.883 --> 02:32:58.791
Why didn't you come back?

3819
02:33:01.307 --> 02:33:03.724
Did you know that I was...?

3820
02:33:07.374 --> 02:33:11.207
MATT: "I didn't know about you until you showed up.

3821
02:33:15.356 --> 02:33:19.808
"And I couldn't come back."

3822
02:33:19.808 --> 02:33:20.966
LAURA: Why?

3823
02:33:23.878 --> 02:33:27.128
MATT: "I was a merchant sailor out of Feolinn.

3824
02:33:28.041 --> 02:33:29.958
"I was working with the Solvia family

3825
02:33:29.958 --> 02:33:31.999
"to ship along the coasts.

3826
02:33:31.999 --> 02:33:34.823
"I was young, I was impetuous, I was trying to make coin,

3827
02:33:34.823 --> 02:33:38.971
"and make a difference, whatever that meant,

3828
02:33:38.971 --> 02:33:41.804
"but I wasn't wealthy by any means.

3829
02:33:44.675 --> 02:33:49.008
"But when I met Marion, I spent every copper I earned

3830
02:33:50.136 --> 02:33:52.553
"to see her. I had to see her.

3831
02:33:55.615 --> 02:33:57.475
"It wasn't until she told me about her feelings

3832
02:33:57.475 --> 02:34:01.268
"that I found myself lacking to meet the standards

3833
02:34:01.268 --> 02:34:04.358
"of such a vibrant creature as her.

3834
02:34:04.358 --> 02:34:06.775
"I was nothing, I had nothing.

3835
02:34:08.173 --> 02:34:11.497
"So I told myself I

3836
02:34:12.589 --> 02:34:15.047
"would find a fortune

3837
02:34:15.047 --> 02:34:16.597
"and come back,

3838
02:34:18.613 --> 02:34:21.354
"and I could prove,

3839
02:34:22.226 --> 02:34:26.842
"over all these other people,

3840
02:34:28.243 --> 02:34:31.777
"that I was worthy.

3841
02:34:35.469 --> 02:34:38.396
"But our ship was attacked,

3842
02:34:38.396 --> 02:34:42.393
"and I was taken prisoner and dragged to Darktow."

3843
02:34:42.393 --> 02:34:43.893
LAURA: I've been there.

3844
02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:46.407
MATT: "Yeah, right.

3845
02:34:48.206 --> 02:34:52.587
"I managed to earn my freedom while I was there.

3846
02:34:52.587 --> 02:34:56.702
"Using the skills I didn't know I had,

3847
02:34:56.702 --> 02:35:01.063
"the skills that I still to this day employ,

3848
02:35:01.063 --> 02:35:04.181
"a knack for speech and business.

3849
02:35:04.181 --> 02:35:09.181
"I earned quite a fortune while I was on that island.

3850
02:35:09.303 --> 02:35:11.453
"But the things I had to do

3851
02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:15.536
"changed who I am.

3852
02:35:19.651 --> 02:35:21.068
"I was a criminal.

3853
02:35:22.783 --> 02:35:24.542
"My name was merely a bounty now

3854
02:35:24.542 --> 02:35:29.534
"to most people on the coast, especially Nicodranas,

3855
02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:35.293
"and I cared too much for Marion to drag her

3856
02:35:35.293 --> 02:35:39.830
"into this underworld that I couldn't escape from.

3857
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:42.308
"So I never returned.

3858
02:35:42.308 --> 02:35:43.896
"I knew she'd be all right without me.

3859
02:35:43.896 --> 02:35:46.479
"She's much stronger than I am.

3860
02:35:52.221 --> 02:35:56.548
"But in my attempts to be worthy,

3861
02:35:56.548 --> 02:36:00.881
"I fell deeper than I ever was,

3862
02:36:04.657 --> 02:36:09.139
"and it wasn't safe for her for me to come back.

3863
02:36:12.561 --> 02:36:14.686
"In my growing influence, I began to draw the ire

3864
02:36:14.686 --> 02:36:18.691
"of the Plank King, and I knew it was time to leave,

3865
02:36:18.691 --> 02:36:22.252
"so slinking north, I found this bed of thieves

3866
02:36:22.252 --> 02:36:26.352
"and built this lawless empire now.

3867
02:36:29.874 --> 02:36:31.471
"It's not really something to be proud of, I'm sure,

3868
02:36:31.471 --> 02:36:35.846
"but I'm sorry.

3869
02:36:40.347 --> 02:36:41.672
"I'm sorry."

3870
02:36:50.508 --> 02:36:51.841
LAURA: She loves you.

3871
02:36:55.614 --> 02:36:57.889
You should've trusted her.

3872
02:37:02.183 --> 02:37:03.899
I don't know...

3873
02:37:06.573 --> 02:37:11.160
I don't know how you guys could
make it work or anything, but

3874
02:37:15.343 --> 02:37:16.185
I always thought growing up,

3875
02:37:16.185 --> 02:37:19.423
I wish I could've known her before you,

3876
02:37:21.098 --> 02:37:22.765
because afterwards...

3877
02:37:32.688 --> 02:37:35.754
She's never loved anyone since.

3878
02:37:40.995 --> 02:37:43.570
She's told me stories about you,

3879
02:37:43.570 --> 02:37:45.097
she said you were the most charming person

3880
02:37:45.097 --> 02:37:46.764
in the entire world.

3881
02:37:48.768 --> 02:37:51.435
MATT: "(sighs)

3882
02:37:53.039 --> 02:37:55.926
"I'm not that person anymore."

3883
02:37:55.926 --> 02:37:57.176
LAURA: I don't know.

3884
02:37:59.473 --> 02:38:02.640
I think your charm got you pretty far.

3885
02:38:04.409 --> 02:38:07.246
(sniffles)

3886
02:38:07.246 --> 02:38:10.350
Why didn't you just say yes?

3887
02:38:10.350 --> 02:38:13.658
I sent you so many messages. I sent you <i>so</i> many messages.

3888
02:38:15.967 --> 02:38:18.464
You could've just said, yes, I'm your dad,

3889
02:38:18.464 --> 02:38:21.827
and oh man, Jester, I didn't know about you,

3890
02:38:21.827 --> 02:38:26.057
but man, I really want to hang out and get to know you.

3891
02:38:26.057 --> 02:38:28.557
MATT: "Jester, I'm not your father.

3892
02:38:29.556 --> 02:38:31.639
"Any man can have a child.

3893
02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:34.763
"Only someone who's around to raise them well

3894
02:38:34.763 --> 02:38:37.382
"can call themselves a father.

3895
02:38:44.796 --> 02:38:48.379
"But for whatever it counts,

3896
02:38:52.981 --> 02:38:55.148
"I see a lot of her in you."

3897
02:38:56.063 --> 02:38:59.980
LAURA: It's the horns.
MATT: "Well, that certainly helps.

3898
02:39:03.096 --> 02:39:08.096
"You're bright, you're clever,

3899
02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:11.577
"you're funny,

3900
02:39:14.617 --> 02:39:19.551
"and you can do a lot of good.

3901
02:39:27.526 --> 02:39:29.980
"I'm glad that you haven't fallen

3902
02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:32.230
"into the same traps I have.

3903
02:39:35.656 --> 02:39:37.739
"I kind of want to protect you

3904
02:39:39.414 --> 02:39:44.015
"from the darker parts of the worlds where we've crossed."

3905
02:39:44.015 --> 02:39:46.098
LAURA: You want to protect me?

3906
02:39:48.344 --> 02:39:49.177
MATT: "Yeah."

3907
02:39:52.825 --> 02:39:54.967
LAURA: I'm going to call you Dad.

3908
02:39:54.967 --> 02:39:56.701
So there's that.

3909
02:39:57.671 --> 02:40:02.206
MATT: He takes a big drink of his wine, puts it back down,

3910
02:40:02.206 --> 02:40:07.206
rubs his forehead, shakes off his hand. (laughs)

3911
02:40:08.926 --> 02:40:10.458
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3912
02:40:10.458 --> 02:40:12.349
LAURA: (laughs)

3913
02:40:13.611 --> 02:40:18.611
So basically, you can't smuggle people ever again.

3914
02:40:18.992 --> 02:40:21.409
SAM: (laughs)

3915
02:40:27.326 --> 02:40:29.076
MATT: "I'm okay with that."

3916
02:40:30.283 --> 02:40:32.450
LAURA: What should I tell Mama?

3917
02:40:34.297 --> 02:40:36.575
What should I tell her?

3918
02:40:36.575 --> 02:40:37.926
MATT: "I don't know if you should."

3919
02:40:37.926 --> 02:40:40.426
LAURA: (sighs)

3920
02:40:43.256 --> 02:40:46.504
Growing up, it was just me and her.

3921
02:40:46.504 --> 02:40:49.167
We told each other everything.

3922
02:40:49.167 --> 02:40:54.167
I feel like, I don't know.

3923
02:40:54.269 --> 02:40:58.769
These last few months, I've just been keeping so much.

3924
02:41:04.844 --> 02:41:06.622
MATT: "You're making a difference in this world,

"there's no other like her out there.

"I know that, in this line of work,

02:41:29.286 --> 02:41:30.304
"it's only a matter of time

02:41:30.304 --> 02:41:35.304
"until either I have to disappear entirely

02:41:35.735 --> 02:41:38.618
"and get a knife in the gut,

02:42:07.008 --> 02:42:08.206
LAURA: Yeah.

02:42:14.805 --> 02:42:16.074
"It's really easy to forget everything

3944
02:42:16.074 --> 02:42:20.670
"and be lost in the stupor of alcohol and drugs

3945
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:25.670
"and women and men, and just be caught up

3946
02:42:25.803 --> 02:42:29.187
"in your own little game of kingpin.

3947
02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:34.017
"But when you walked in,

3948
02:42:38.249 --> 02:42:40.416
"all of that's changed now."

3949
02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:43.543
LAURA: Wow.

3950
02:42:49.351 --> 02:42:51.184
Hey, I've got an idea.

3951
02:42:53.136 --> 02:42:57.870
What if you decide to give all this up

3952
02:42:59.666 --> 02:43:04.666
and Mama decides to leave the Lavish Chateau?

3953
02:43:05.449 --> 02:43:08.145
She's been thinking about stopping for a while now;

3954
02:43:08.145 --> 02:43:11.819
she just doesn't know what to do with herself.

3955
02:43:11.819 --> 02:43:16.619
I think you should go back to Nicodranas, secretly,

3956
02:43:17.599 --> 02:43:19.440
and sweep her off her feet,

3957
02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:21.722
and the two of you could ride off into the sunset,

3958
02:43:21.722 --> 02:43:25.888
take a ship somewhere, and just

3959
02:43:25.888 --> 02:43:27.854
live happily ever after.

3960
02:43:30.974 --> 02:43:33.474
MATT: "It's a nice dream, isn't it?"

3961
02:43:35.099 --> 02:43:36.549
LAURA: Yeah.

3962
02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:41.167
MATT: "It's a nice dream."

3963
02:43:43.131 --> 02:43:45.747
He finishes his drink,

3964
02:43:47.706 --> 02:43:50.131
gets off of his stool,

3965
02:43:52.712 --> 02:43:54.629
puts his hand on yours.

3966
02:43:58.286 --> 02:43:59.869
"Good night, Jester."

3967
02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:02.335
LAURA: Hey, Dad?

3968
02:44:04.836 --> 02:44:09.836
Next time I'm in town, let's play some Uno.

3969
02:44:13.502 --> 02:44:15.685
MATT: "Marquesian, interesting."

3970
02:44:15.685 --> 02:44:18.102
SAM: (laughs)

3971
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:23.043
MATT: "Okay."

3972
02:44:25.099 --> 02:44:29.516
He turns around and takes a few steps, and stops.

3973
02:44:31.767 --> 02:44:32.600
Takes a deep breath,

3974
02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:36.248
and then keeps walking to his bedchamber.

3975
02:44:36.248 --> 02:44:38.147
LAURA: (shaky sigh)

3976
02:44:41.087 --> 02:44:43.763
I stay there for like an hour,

3977
02:44:43.763 --> 02:44:47.263
not really sipping my drink, just staring.

3978
02:44:52.977 --> 02:44:54.477
Did you hear that?

3979
02:44:58.461 --> 02:44:59.919
We found him.

3980
02:45:06.684 --> 02:45:08.434
And I go back to bed.

3981
02:45:09.446 --> 02:45:12.080
MATT: And that's when we take our break.

3982
02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:13.425
TALIESIN: We're all dead upstairs.

3983
02:45:13.425 --> 02:45:15.099
(laughter)

3984
02:45:15.099 --> 02:45:17.599
MATT: Just completely slaughtered!

3985
02:45:17.599 --> 02:45:20.986
LIAM: Short rest, rolled some hit dice, and fucked us up.

3986
02:45:20.986 --> 02:45:22.208
TRAVIS: We could overhear your conversation end,

3987
02:45:22.208 --> 02:45:24.427
like oh, how are you?

3988
02:45:24.427 --> 02:45:27.136
(laughter)

3989
02:45:27.136 --> 02:45:29.184
MATT: All right, we'll be back here in just a few minutes

3990
02:45:29.184 --> 02:45:31.012
from our break, and it was a little late break there,

3991
02:45:31.012 --> 02:45:33.896
but I lost track of the time.

3992
02:45:33.896 --> 02:45:37.879
So we have our Wyrmwood giveaway tonight.

3993
02:45:37.879 --> 02:45:40.207
This is the Black Poisonwood Dice Vault

3994
02:45:40.207 --> 02:45:42.047
for one lucky winner.

3995
02:45:42.047 --> 02:45:43.047
Smells nice.

3996
02:45:44.298 --> 02:45:46.977
The word tonight, the keyword is Surprise.

3997
02:45:46.977 --> 02:45:50.139
(laughter)

3998
02:45:50.139 --> 02:45:52.369
MATT: Surprise, once and only once in the chatroom,

3999
02:45:52.369 --> 02:45:53.535
more than once, you'll be disqualified,

4000
02:45:53.535 --> 02:45:55.291
and for the U.S. and Canada only,

4001
02:45:55.291 --> 02:45:56.621
excluding Quebec because of stupid laws,

4002
02:45:56.621 --> 02:45:58.548
we will return shortly with the winner

4003
02:45:58.548 --> 02:45:59.686
and the rest of the session.

4004
02:45:59.686 --> 02:46:00.757
See you guys in a minute.

4005
02:46:00.757 --> 02:46:03.424

TRAVIS: What's up, all you beautiful people?

4024
02:46:55.387 --> 02:46:59.250
Happy November from all of us here at Critical Role.

4025
02:46:59.250 --> 02:47:01.038
Now, you may be asking yourself, Travis,

4026
02:47:01.038 --> 02:47:03.122
why are you so excited that it's November?

4027
02:47:03.122 --> 02:47:05.027
Well, that means it's the end of October,

4028
02:47:05.027 --> 02:47:07.844
which means that it's the end of Halloween,

4029
02:47:07.844 --> 02:47:09.430
and I don't have to worry about anyone else

4030
02:47:09.430 --> 02:47:12.251
trying to jump out and scare me.

4031
02:47:12.251 --> 02:47:13.440
I need a break from all of that.

4032
02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:14.711
But because it is November,

4033
02:47:14.711 --> 02:47:16.399
we wanted to take this opportunity to announce

4034
02:47:16.399 --> 02:47:18.061
that Critical Role is once again partnering

4035
02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:21.250
with the amazing folks over at OSD.

4036
02:47:21.250 --> 02:47:23.122
Now, if you guys don't know what OSD is,

4037
02:47:23.122 --> 02:47:24.725
they are an amazing charity

4038
02:47:24.725 --> 02:47:27.411
that supports military service members and their families,

4039
02:47:27.411 --> 02:47:29.521
whether they're in active duty, or in civilian life,

4040
02:47:29.521 --> 02:47:32.297
or even the transition in between, which is so important.

4041
02:47:32.297 --> 02:47:33.986
Coming from a military family myself,

4042
02:47:33.986 --> 02:47:35.952
I have been a fan of OSD for years.

4043
02:47:35.952 --> 02:47:37.426
I've loved working with these guys,

4044
02:47:37.426 --> 02:47:40.395
and wanted to take a moment to congratulate them

4045
02:47:40.395 --> 02:47:42.681
on officially supporting over a million-plus

4046
02:47:42.681 --> 02:47:44.618
service members and their families.

4047
02:47:44.618 --> 02:47:45.818
Guys, a million!

4048
02:47:45.818 --> 02:47:47.859
That is the love we need in this world.

4049
02:47:47.859 --> 02:47:51.877
These people put so much on the line every day for us.

4050
02:47:51.877 --> 02:47:53.540
We want to give back in any way that we can,

4051
02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:56.058
so all month long, charity push.

4052
02:47:56.058 --> 02:47:59.531
The link is critrole.com/OSD.

4053
02:47:59.531 --> 02:48:03.403
Again, that is critrole.com/OSD.

4054
02:48:03.403 --> 02:48:05.092
Again, and as always, if you're not able

4055
02:48:05.092 --> 02:48:07.798
to financially support, spread the word,

4056
02:48:07.798 --> 02:48:09.861
share the link, let people know.

4057
02:48:09.861 --> 02:48:11.556
This is something that want to do,

4058
02:48:11.556 --> 02:48:13.051
we want to give back to these people

4059
02:48:13.051 --> 02:48:17.081
that do so much for us every single day.

4060
02:48:17.081 --> 02:48:19.491
We hope we're a part of the next million for OSD,

4061
02:48:19.491 --> 02:48:22.437
and as always, thank you for your support and generosity.

4062
02:48:22.437 --> 02:48:25.688
Happy November, happy Thanksgiving,

4063
02:48:25.688 --> 02:48:29.313
bring on the non-spooky holidays.

4064
02:48:29.313 --> 02:48:31.147
Love you guys.

4065
02:48:31.147 --> 02:48:33.463
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

4066
02:48:33.463 --> 02:48:37.774
BRIAN: Three, two, one, do it.

4067
02:48:37.774 --> 02:48:39.137
LAURA: That was good.

4068
02:48:39.137 --> 02:48:41.178
BRIAN: Of course I flinched!

4069
02:48:41.178 --> 02:48:42.837
Did you see what happened last time?

4070
02:48:42.837 --> 02:48:43.887
DANI: Yes, but you can't flinch!

4071
02:48:43.887 --> 02:48:46.866
LAURA: I've never practiced this ever in my entire life.

4072
02:48:46.866 --> 02:48:49.366
BRIAN: Go, three, two, one.

4073
02:48:50.950 --> 02:48:52.254
Oh!

4074
02:48:52.254 --> 02:48:55.170
(laughter)

4075
02:48:55.170 --> 02:48:57.389
BRIAN: Oh, man.

4076
02:48:57.389 --> 02:49:00.642
I almost, ooh, sorry, Laura.

4077
02:49:00.642 --> 02:49:03.661 line:15%
Caleb contrasted himself against Fjord and Caduceus

4078
02:49:03.661 --> 02:49:06.448 line:15%
this episode, holding them up as men of religion.

4079
02:49:06.448 --> 02:49:08.717 line:15%
Since he's such a recent convert,

4080
02:49:08.717 --> 02:49:11.429 line:15%
how did being labeled this way sit with Fjord?

4081
02:49:11.429 --> 02:49:13.277 line:15%
Does he feel he deserves it yet,

4082
02:49:13.277 --> 02:49:15.379 line:15%
or still has much to learn before he can be

4083
02:49:15.379 --> 02:49:18.977 line:15%
in the same category as Caduceus?

4084
02:49:18.977 --> 02:49:21.582 line:15%
TRAVIS: Great question, James Whitney.

4085
02:49:21.582 --> 02:49:22.973 line:15%
BRIAN: Probably not his real name.

4086
02:49:22.973 --> 02:49:27.339 line:15%
TRAVIS: (chuckles) Yeah no, he does not feel

4087
02:49:27.339 --> 02:49:29.364
like he has earned that yet,

4088
02:49:29.364 --> 02:49:30.747 line:15%
still very new to it.

4089
02:49:30.747 --> 02:49:34.156 line:15%
I don't think he would be able to

4090
02:49:34.156 --> 02:49:36.502 line:15%
even convince anybody else to follow the ways

4091
02:49:36.502 --> 02:49:39.098 line:15%
of the Wildmother.

4092
02:49:39.098 --> 02:49:40.595 line:15%
He's still learning a lot from Caduceus

4093
02:49:40.595 --> 02:49:45.428 line:15%
and is still trying to figure out how this applies to him.

4094
02:49:46.518 --> 02:49:48.569 line:15%
Yeah, I think even in that moment--

4095
02:49:48.569 --> 02:49:49.549 line:15%
(ice clanging)

4096
02:49:49.549 --> 02:49:51.528 line:15%
BRIAN: Stop it!

4097
02:49:51.528 --> 02:49:53.528
TRAVIS: Sounds like a cowbell.

4098
02:49:54.608 --> 02:49:57.275
Old Bessie is walking backstage.

4099
02:49:58.506 --> 02:49:59.671
Sit down, girl!

4100
02:49:59.671 --> 02:50:03.012
DANI: (laughs)

4101
02:50:03.012 --> 02:50:04.046
LAURA: Sorry, keep going.

4102
02:50:04.046 --> 02:50:04.996
I had this conversation today,

4103
02:50:04.996 --> 02:50:07.663
I was actually at recording session this morning,

4104
02:50:07.663 --> 02:50:11.246
and one of the people that was recording me

4105
02:50:12.277 --> 02:50:13.989
said they were a fan of Critical Role,

4106
02:50:13.989 --> 02:50:15.416
and they were like, can I ask you a question,

4107
02:50:15.416 --> 02:50:16.692
like a Talks Machina question?

4108
02:50:16.692 --> 02:50:19.050
I was like sure, they were like,

4109
02:50:19.050 --> 02:50:22.470
what's going on with Jester's crush on Fjord?

4110
02:50:22.470 --> 02:50:24.862
Is that still happening?

4111
02:50:24.862 --> 02:50:25.935
I can answer that right now,

4112
02:50:25.935 --> 02:50:27.734
and it's in the same vein.

4113
02:50:27.734 --> 02:50:31.034
It was kind of this realization

4114
02:50:31.034 --> 02:50:34.504
that she had a very childlike outlook

4115
02:50:34.504 --> 02:50:36.743
on how all of that was going down,

4116
02:50:36.743 --> 02:50:39.905
and her interactions with him were very immature,

4117
02:50:39.905 --> 02:50:42.646
and she realized it, especially after everything

4118
02:50:42.646 --> 02:50:44.240
that happened with Avantika and everything,

4119
02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:46.960
and it made her reevaluate

4120
02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:51.430
how she would approach relationships moving forward,

4121
02:50:51.430 --> 02:50:54.264
and the conversations with Beau

4122
02:50:54.264 --> 02:50:57.725
of going, oh, this isn't how actual relationships are.

4123
02:50:57.725 --> 02:51:01.170
Maybe I have been jaded or blind to the world.

4124
02:51:01.170 --> 02:51:02.425
BRIAN: Our winner for this week

4125
02:51:02.425 --> 02:51:07.425
was sent in by Kinn @kinnvelier,

photography by Klara Cu.

4127
02:51:10.182 --> 02:51:11.955
I fucked this all up.

4128
02:51:11.955 --> 02:51:13.608
What else is new?

4129
02:51:13.608 --> 02:51:15.700 line:15%
Let's take a look.

4130

LAURA: Oh, I love her!

4131
02:51:20.201 --> 02:51:22.117 line:15%
She's so wonderful.

4132
02:51:23.607 --> 02:51:25.500 line:15%
BRIAN: I feel like we have met this person.

4133
02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:26.381 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean,

4134
02:51:26.381 --> 02:51:27.254 line:15%
we've seen her at conventions.

4135
02:51:27.254 --> 02:51:28.403 line:15%
TRAVIS: The wings are so good.

4136
02:51:28.403 --> 02:51:30.300 line:15%
LAURA: This is a more intricate cosplay

4137
02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:31.887 line:15%
than I've ever seen.

4138
02:51:31.887 --> 02:51:34.281 line:15%
BRIAN: For both of you, what are your characters' views

4139
02:51:34.281 --> 02:51:37.848 line:15%
on the Cerberus Assembly and Oremid Hass?

4140
02:51:37.848 --> 02:51:39.121 line:15%
DANI: Yep.

4141
02:51:39.121 --> 02:51:40.585 line:15%
BRIAN: What do you mean, yep?

4142
02:51:40.585 --> 02:51:44.585 line:15%
LAURA: Do they trust that the info they gave--?

4143
02:51:47.122 --> 02:51:49.112 line:15%
TRAVIS: You can't do that. Brian--

4144
02:51:49.112 --> 02:51:50.113 line:15%
Brian doesn't like you--

4145
02:51:50.113 --> 02:51:51.787 line:15%
BRIAN: There's two things you can't do.

4146
02:51:51.787 --> 02:51:53.621 line:15%
Number one, ask the question for me,

4147
02:51:53.621 --> 02:51:55.292 line:15%
and number two, look in my camera.

4148
02:51:55.292 --> 02:51:56.634 line:15%
TRAVIS: You can't look in his camera.

4149
02:51:56.634 --> 02:51:58.311 line:15%
BRIAN: Don't you fucking--

4150
02:51:58.311 --> 02:51:59.393 line:15%
LAURA: Why?

4151
02:51:59.393 --> 02:52:01.803 line:15%
Is there something I'm not supposed to see on here?

4152
02:52:01.803 --> 02:52:05.159 line:15%
TRAVIS: Don't you know, he's going to be mad.

4153
02:52:05.159 --> 02:52:07.813
LAURA: (laughs)

4154
02:52:07.813 --> 02:52:09.467
TRAVIS: Yeah, go ahead.

4155
02:52:09.467 --> 02:52:11.139
LAURA: Oh! He gave me his iPad.

4156
02:52:11.139 --> 02:52:13.456
TRAVIS: All the questions are right here.

4157
02:52:13.456 --> 02:52:14.989
BRIAN: Come on, puppy. Let's go.
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, here we go.

4158
02:52:14.989 --> 02:52:19.064
LAURA: Okay, finally. (sighs)

4159
02:52:19.064 --> 02:52:20.407
For both of us.
TRAVIS: Yes, more attractive

4160
02:52:20.407 --> 02:52:21.600
Brian Foster.

4161
02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:24.022 line:15%
Seriously, who gets stabbed when you're checking out?

4162
02:52:24.022 --> 02:52:25.707 line:15%
That's terrible.

4163
02:52:25.707 --> 02:52:27.010 line:15%
LAURA: That looked cool.

4164
02:52:27.010 --> 02:52:28.972 line:15%
(blows raspberry)

4165
02:52:28.972 --> 02:52:29.901 line:15%
BRIAN: What do you mean, it looked cool?

4166
02:52:29.901 --> 02:52:30.734 line:15%
LAURA: I don't know,

4167
02:52:30.734 --> 02:52:31.567 line:15%
I just saw my lip going.
TRAVIS: Is that the first time

4168
02:52:31.567 --> 02:52:32.419 line:15%
you've ever done that?

4169
02:52:32.419 --> 02:52:33.919 line:15%
LAURA: On camera, yeah.

4170
02:52:33.919 --> 02:52:36.752 line:15%
(blows raspberry)

4171
02:52:38.014 --> 02:52:38.954 line:15%
BRIAN: Thank you, Zach.

4172
02:52:38.954 --> 02:52:40.557
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4173
02:52:40.557 --> 02:52:41.916
LAURA: It looks so stupid!

4174
02:52:41.916 --> 02:52:43.054
BRIAN: Do it again, wait, Zach?

4175
02:52:43.054 --> 02:52:45.077
LAURA: Now I'm embarrassed.

4176
02:52:45.077 --> 02:52:49.244
BRIAN: Okay, lower that octopus and do it once.

4177
02:52:50.188 --> 02:52:51.999
TRAVIS: Three, two, one.

4178
02:52:51.999 --> 02:52:54.258
LAURA: (blows raspberry)
TRAVIS: (fart noise)

4179
02:52:54.258 --> 02:52:56.295
BRIAN: That looks like CGI.

4180
02:52:56.295 --> 02:52:58.462
TRAVIS: All right, my turn.

4181
02:53:00.732 --> 02:53:04.455
(blows raspberry)
(laughter)

4182
02:53:04.455 --> 02:53:05.855
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

4183
02:53:05.855 --> 02:53:07.922
Why is it doing that?

4184
02:53:07.922 --> 02:53:09.445
(blows raspberry)

4185
02:53:09.445 --> 02:53:12.128
(laughter)

4186
02:53:12.128 --> 02:53:13.744
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Holy shit!

4187
02:53:13.744 --> 02:53:15.095
What the fuck?

4188
02:53:15.095 --> 02:53:17.262
LAURA: (laughs uncontrollably)

4189
02:53:17.262 --> 02:53:19.074
Ready, do it together.

4190
02:53:19.074 --> 02:53:19.907
BRIAN: Do it at the same time.

4191
02:53:19.907 --> 02:53:21.106
Get on the two-shot.

4192
02:53:21.106 --> 02:53:22.968
TRAVIS: One, two, three.

4193
02:53:22.968 --> 02:53:24.084
(blows raspberry)

4194
02:53:24.084 --> 02:53:26.334
(laughing)

4195
02:53:27.202 --> 02:53:28.523
BRIAN: You guys, do you know every week,

4196
02:53:28.523 --> 02:53:30.552
people think we're so fucking high?

4197
02:53:30.552 --> 02:53:33.219
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4198
02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:37.287
TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

4199
02:53:37.287 --> 02:53:39.085
TRAVIS: You're not Brian!

4200
02:53:39.085 --> 02:53:42.060
What kind of black magic is this, where's my friend?

4201
02:53:42.060 --> 02:53:43.815
Where's that fucking cat?

4202
02:53:43.815 --> 02:53:46.622
Tina! <i>Tina!</i>

4203
02:53:46.622 --> 02:53:51.622
LIAM: Oh, shut your yap, you giant walking thumb!

4204
02:53:51.947 --> 02:53:53.413
Woo!

4205
02:53:56.619 --> 02:53:58.029
TRAVIS: Who is that?

4206
02:53:58.029 --> 02:54:03.029 line:15%
LIAM: It's me, your old adventuring friend, Minnesota Jones!

4207
02:54:03.382 --> 02:54:06.697
LAURA: Oh hey, Minnesota Jones, how you been?

4208
02:54:06.697 --> 02:54:10.481
LAURA: Darling, you made it!

4209
02:54:10.481 --> 02:54:12.664
TRAVIS: Wait, you guys know each other?

4210
02:54:12.664 --> 02:54:14.541
LIAM: (laughs)

4211
02:54:14.541 --> 02:54:16.414
Of course we know each other!

4212
02:54:16.414 --> 02:54:18.750
Who doesn't know the greatest realm-walker

4213
02:54:18.750 --> 02:54:20.753
in the all the game-verse?
LAURA: I'm kind of famous.

4214
02:54:20.753 --> 02:54:25.125
LIAM: The grand Titan of Ov, the mother of all critters,

4215
02:54:25.125 --> 02:54:29.452
Miss Laura Give-Me-the-Fucking-Harps Bailey!

4216
02:54:29.452 --> 02:54:31.254
TRAVIS: The mother of--?

4217
02:54:31.254 --> 02:54:32.587
Yeah, of course.

4218
02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:36.575
LIAM: I'm siphoning energy off the games soul

4219
02:54:36.575 --> 02:54:37.954
that you've been charging,

4220
02:54:37.954 --> 02:54:40.373
but it wasn't enough to port us all.

4221
02:54:40.373 --> 02:54:42.567
Looks like I only sent the thin-lipped freak

4222
02:54:42.567 --> 02:54:44.592
through the astral tunnel.

4223
02:54:44.592 --> 02:54:47.554
Your screams gave this baby a lot of juice last time,

4224
02:54:47.554 --> 02:54:50.998
but now, we need something stronger than fear:

4225
02:54:50.998 --> 02:54:55.998
true love, with him, or anyone you fancy.

4226
02:54:56.556 --> 02:54:59.897
LAURA: Whatever you need, Minnesota Jones.

4227
02:54:59.897 --> 02:55:01.482
What're we playing today?

4228
02:55:01.482 --> 02:55:02.928
LIAM: Overcooked 2!

4229
02:55:02.928 --> 02:55:03.903
This game is known for

4230
02:55:03.903 --> 02:55:07.222
bringing people together in harmony.

4231
02:55:07.222 --> 02:55:09.655
It's just, we need to get this baby cooking.

4232
02:55:09.655 --> 02:55:11.335
TRAVIS: Minnesota Jones just suggested

4233
02:55:11.335 --> 02:55:15.299
that you should find love with maybe someone else.

4234
02:55:15.299 --> 02:55:17.894
LAURA: That's crazy.
TRAVIS: I'm-a track him down.

4235
02:55:17.894 --> 02:55:22.155
LAURA: He needs to pay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, I need that glove.

4236
02:55:22.155 --> 02:55:24.155
Here, have some seaweed.

4237
02:55:27.024 --> 02:55:29.024
Have some rice, bitches.

4238
02:55:31.399 --> 02:55:34.503
LAURA: Oh god, why are we so bad?

4239
02:55:34.503 --> 02:55:36.670
TRAVIS: I don't know, it's hard!

4240
02:55:37.890 --> 02:55:40.857
LAURA: Three orders failed, we only had four.

4241
02:55:40.857 --> 02:55:45.278
TRAVIS: (laughs) The three of the four were wrong?

4242
02:55:45.278 --> 02:55:48.111
LAURA: If we're this bad at management.

4243
02:55:49.008 --> 02:55:50.600
Our poor child.

4244
02:55:52.864 --> 02:55:55.580
TRAVIS: Hey, nothing's caught fire yet.

4245
02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:58.096
LAURA: It's burning! It's burning!

4246
02:55:58.096 --> 02:55:59.202
This is great.

4247
02:55:59.202 --> 02:56:02.552
Oh, your fucking oil is on fire.

4248
02:56:05.469 --> 02:56:06.552
TRAVIS: We're okay.

4249
02:56:07.940 --> 02:56:09.317
LAURA: Your fire extinguisher.

4250
02:56:09.317 --> 02:56:10.976
Oh god, your whole kitchen!

4251
02:56:10.976 --> 02:56:12.501
TRAVIS: I got it!

4252
02:56:12.501 --> 02:56:13.851
LAURA: Go into the corner!

4253
02:56:13.851 --> 02:56:14.809
Oh my god.

4254
02:56:14.809 --> 02:56:16.074
TRAVIS: (screams)

4255
02:56:16.074 --> 02:56:18.121
You got to throw something in your mouth,

4256
02:56:18.121 --> 02:56:19.572
but do it from out here.

4257
02:56:19.572 --> 02:56:20.405
On the count of three.

4258
02:56:20.405 --> 02:56:22.413
One, two, three.

4259
02:56:23.426 --> 02:56:24.384
Did you get it?
LAURA: No.

4260
02:56:24.384 --> 02:56:25.322
TRAVIS: I did.

4261
02:56:25.322 --> 02:56:26.155
Ready?
LAURA: One.

4262
02:56:26.155 --> 02:56:27.740
TRAVIS: Two.
LAURA: Three.

4263
02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:28.742
TRAVIS: Did you get it?
LAURA: No.

4264
02:56:28.742 --> 02:56:29.575
TRAVIS: I did.

4265
02:56:31.001 --> 02:56:33.877
LAURA: One, two, three.

4266
02:56:33.877 --> 02:56:35.195
(gasps)

4267
02:56:35.195 --> 02:56:36.127
TRAVIS: You finally got one?

4268
02:56:36.127 --> 02:56:37.797
LAURA: I did, I never get them!

4269
02:56:37.797 --> 02:56:39.404
TRAVIS: That's amazing!
LAURA: Baby!

4270
02:56:39.404 --> 02:56:42.122
I'm just going to wash some dishes.

4271
02:56:42.122 --> 02:56:44.492
I'm so sick of your shit.

4272
02:56:44.492 --> 02:56:47.458
TRAVIS: Look, I'll take care of everything.

4273
02:56:47.458 --> 02:56:49.366
LAURA: Go, go, go!

4274
02:56:49.366 --> 02:56:50.468
And then I'll do this one.

4275
02:56:50.468 --> 02:56:51.464
TRAVIS: Yeah, put it out there.

4276
02:56:51.464 --> 02:56:53.080
Order up, I got it!

4277
02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:54.080
LAURA: Oh my god!

4278
02:56:55.529 --> 02:56:57.539
TRAVIS: Oh, you son of a bitch.

4279
02:56:57.539 --> 02:57:00.826
This is, oh!

4280
02:57:02.865 --> 02:57:03.698
Damn it!

4281
02:57:05.352 --> 02:57:06.185
Fuck!

4282
02:57:07.195 --> 02:57:11.445
I can't grab anything, I want to grab the damn fryer!

4283
02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:14.153
Shit!

4284
02:57:14.153 --> 02:57:15.956
LAURA: What are you doing?

4285
02:57:15.956 --> 02:57:18.039
(laughs)

4286
02:57:21.266 --> 02:57:24.403
TRAVIS: Where's the damn-- give me the turkey nuggets!

4287
02:57:24.403 --> 02:57:25.320
LAURA: Order up!

4288
02:57:26.693 --> 02:57:29.793
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm coming!

4289
02:57:29.793 --> 02:57:31.751
(laughter)

4290
02:57:33.327 --> 02:57:34.994
TRAVIS: Wait, we reappeared!

4291
02:57:36.339 --> 02:57:38.484
The gods are merciful.

4292
02:57:38.484 --> 02:57:40.501
This is fucking terrible.

4293
02:57:40.501 --> 02:57:42.491
Cheeto and carrot.

4294
02:57:42.491 --> 02:57:44.221
LAURA: Oh, a carrot?

4295
02:57:44.221 --> 02:57:46.075
A Cheeto and a carrot?

4296
02:57:46.075 --> 02:57:47.871
TRAVIS: Isn't that what they call carrots, candy corn?

4297
02:57:47.871 --> 02:57:49.654
What are these called, they're corn.

4298
02:57:49.654 --> 02:57:54.562
(wheezing laughter)

4299
02:57:56.199 --> 02:57:58.066
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

4300
02:57:58.066 --> 02:58:01.577
(laughter)

4301
02:58:02.721 --> 02:58:05.841
Oh no. (laughs)

4302
02:58:05.841 --> 02:58:08.116
LAURA: That is so weird!

4303
02:58:11.287 --> 02:58:12.645
Oh, shit.

4304
02:58:12.645 --> 02:58:16.895
TRAVIS: We're not going to (gags) I choked!

4305
02:58:17.793 --> 02:58:21.121
It's not a carrot. (laughs)

4306
02:58:21.121 --> 02:58:25.996
(Western music)

4307
02:59:28.533 --> 02:59:29.573
(upbeat music)

4308
02:59:29.573 --> 02:59:30.499
WILL: Hey, everyone.

4309
02:59:30.499 --> 02:59:32.761 line:15%
The insanely talented Will Friedle here.

4310
02:59:32.761 --> 02:59:33.594 line:15%
I'm excited to announce

4311
02:59:33.594 --> 02:59:35.085 line:15%
that I have a new late-night talk show

4312
02:59:35.085 --> 02:59:36.847
coming to the Critical Role YouTube channel

4313
02:59:36.847 --> 02:59:39.445
on Wednesdays called Mini Primetime.

4314
02:59:39.445 --> 02:59:40.612
It's brought to you by the same creators

4315
02:59:40.612 --> 02:59:43.620
as that one show with the hippie kid

4316
02:59:43.620 --> 02:59:45.350
with the bracelets, whatever that is.

4317
02:59:45.350 --> 02:59:47.855
Anyway, my show, Mini Primetime,

4318
02:59:47.855 --> 02:59:50.762
is a mini painting show for beginners and veterans alike,

4319
02:59:50.762 --> 02:59:53.160
where this handsome face teaches the Critical Role cast

4320
02:59:53.160 --> 02:59:55.151
how to paint their own Mighty Nein minis.

4321
02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:57.457
We're going to be focusing on specific techniques,

4322
02:59:57.457 --> 02:59:59.322
fades, small detail work,

4323
02:59:59.322 --> 03:00:00.643
and taking your mini to the next level

4324
03:00:00.643 --> 03:00:02.002
by adding to your base.

4325
03:00:02.002 --> 03:00:05.382 line:15%
So look for it soon on Critical Role's YouTube.

4326
03:00:05.382 --> 03:00:06.500 line:15%
Critical Role, what is that?

4327
03:00:06.500 --> 03:00:08.717 line:15%
What is even a Critical Role?

4328
03:00:08.717 --> 03:00:12.550
Oh, that's right, that was the show with Kash.

4329
03:00:22.095 --> 03:00:27.036
(upbeat jazzy music)

4330
03:00:40.671 --> 03:00:45.079
(birds chirping)

4331
03:00:46.271 --> 03:00:48.461
SAM: I'm a fan of hot air balloon rides

4332
03:00:48.461 --> 03:00:51.044
above the Venetian countryside.

4333
03:00:51.921 --> 03:00:56.307
I'm a fan of Momlan, she's always got my back.

4334
03:00:56.307 --> 03:01:00.032
I'm a fan of wine older than Taliesin.

4335
03:01:01.767 --> 03:01:04.600
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

4336
03:01:05.922 --> 03:01:08.553
I'm a fan of emotes by Arsequeef.

4337
03:01:08.553 --> 03:01:09.636
They're neat.

4338
03:01:10.794 --> 03:01:14.205
I'm a fan of a wife so cool people forget I exist.

4339
03:01:14.205 --> 03:01:16.640
(spooky music)

4340
03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:19.140
(bird cawing)

4341
03:01:20.811 --> 03:01:23.644
(explosion bangs)

4342
03:01:25.023 --> 03:01:27.856
(creepy laughter)

4343
03:01:29.749 --> 03:01:33.282
(heartbeat)

4344
03:01:33.282 --> 03:01:36.615
(baby crying)

4345
03:01:41.271 --> 03:01:42.150
I'm a fan of--

4346
03:01:42.150 --> 03:01:46.916 line:15%
("Spring" by Antonio Vivaldi)

4347
03:01:57.007 --> 03:02:01.424
(dramatic music)

4348
03:14:19.890 --> 03:14:22.332
(laughter)

4349
03:14:22.332 --> 03:14:25.884
MATT: Congratulations, Laura Bailey, you got me.

4350
03:14:25.884 --> 03:14:26.717
Welcome back, everyone.

4351
03:14:26.717 --> 03:14:27.705
So we have the winner.

4352
03:14:27.705 --> 03:14:32.414
The winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway is Think Not Think.

4353
03:14:32.414 --> 03:14:35.635
Think <i>Not</i> Think. <i>Think</i> Not Th--

4354
03:14:35.635 --> 03:14:37.064
I don't know how you'd say it with the emphasis,

4355
03:14:37.064 --> 03:14:38.580
but congratulations, you won it,

4356
03:14:38.580 --> 03:14:41.562
we'll get that to you ASAP.

4357
03:14:41.562 --> 03:14:42.395
So.

4358
03:14:43.754 --> 03:14:45.410
SAM: Oh, shit.

4359
03:14:45.410 --> 03:14:48.504
Over the break, why didn't we discuss what we're doing?

4360
03:14:48.504 --> 03:14:51.004
TALIESIN: We had to eat peanut butter.

4361
03:14:51.893 --> 03:14:54.246
SAM: What're we doing?

4362
03:14:54.246 --> 03:14:56.443
MARISHA: I don't know.
SAM: I don't know either.

4363
03:14:56.443 --> 03:14:59.968
MATT: You wake up without issue.

4364
03:14:59.968 --> 03:15:02.799
The sanctuary in the Gentleman's lair

4365
03:15:02.799 --> 03:15:04.805
seemingly went undisturbed,

4366
03:15:04.805 --> 03:15:09.380
beyond your brief evening's conversation.

4367
03:15:09.380 --> 03:15:10.964
You wake up.

4368
03:15:10.964 --> 03:15:13.016
Weirdly, because of your time in Xhorhas,

4369
03:15:13.016 --> 03:15:15.469
used to not looking to sunlight to gauge morning,

4370
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:20.255
and subterranean sleep also presents a similar experience.

4371
03:15:20.255 --> 03:15:24.252
But the day is yours, what would you like to do?

4372
03:15:24.252 --> 03:15:26.571
LIAM: One thing we can do is be proactive.

4373
03:15:26.571 --> 03:15:28.813
There's only a matter of time

4374
03:15:28.813 --> 03:15:32.979
before this person comes for us again,

4375
03:15:32.979 --> 03:15:35.014
so we go to them instead,

4376
03:15:35.014 --> 03:15:38.014
and we try to bring back our friend.

4377
03:15:39.020 --> 03:15:40.625
So let's start the day off correctly.

4378
03:15:40.625 --> 03:15:42.432
We are going to look in on them, yeah?

4379
03:15:42.432 --> 03:15:44.150
SAM: A little morning Scry?

4380
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:47.720
TRAVIS: Are we going to join with Pumat to double our fun?

4381
03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:50.553
LAURA: Yeah, because he can do it, too.

4382
03:15:50.553 --> 03:15:52.208
SAM: Yes.

4383
03:15:52.208 --> 03:15:54.705
TRAVIS: He probably totally survived the night.

4384
03:15:54.705 --> 03:15:55.946
LAURA: Oh gosh.

4385
03:15:56.834 --> 03:15:59.334
SAM: From Gentleman's to Pumat's.

4386
03:16:00.173 --> 03:16:03.535
We don't go through the Tri-Spire, right?

4387
03:16:03.535 --> 03:16:06.080
MATT: Gentleman's to Pumat's?

4388
03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:08.781
No, but the Tri-Spire is visible.

4389
03:16:08.781 --> 03:16:10.348
TALIESIN: Did we ever get word on the family,

4390
03:16:10.348 --> 03:16:11.680
on whether or not they were all right?

4391
03:16:11.680 --> 03:16:13.763
Did they figure that out?

4392
03:16:15.151 --> 03:16:17.291
MATT: So you go ahead and ask about that?

4393
03:16:17.291 --> 03:16:18.982
About which family, your family?

4394
03:16:18.982 --> 03:16:21.040
TALIESIN: No, obviously not yet.

4395
03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:22.818
MARISHA: The Stassmans?
TALIESIN: Yeah, the Stassmans.

4396
03:16:22.818 --> 03:16:24.685
MATT: Oh yeah, so, word comes back,

4397
03:16:24.685 --> 03:16:26.963
and as you guys come to consciousness,

4398
03:16:26.963 --> 03:16:28.932
Gentleman's not up yet, but he does eventually join you

4399
03:16:28.932 --> 03:16:30.915
as you're gathering your stuff.

4400
03:16:30.915 --> 03:16:35.769
"So looking into this family, the Stassmans,

4401
03:16:35.769 --> 03:16:39.552
"apparently they were burgled

4402
03:16:39.552 --> 03:16:42.935
"about a few weeks back.

4403
03:16:42.935 --> 03:16:46.883
"Two members of the family were killed."

4404
03:16:46.883 --> 03:16:49.574
LAURA: I told you they were probably dead.

4405
03:16:49.574 --> 03:16:51.823
SAM: You were right.

4406
03:16:51.823 --> 03:16:56.173
MATT: "So that is concerning.

4407
03:16:56.173 --> 03:16:57.834
"Thankfully, most of the family seemed to survive,

4408
03:16:57.834 --> 03:17:00.605
"though some injured and recovering,

4409
03:17:00.605 --> 03:17:02.295
"so I didn't lose a client.

4410
03:17:02.295 --> 03:17:06.084
"But for whatever information that helps."

4411
03:17:06.084 --> 03:17:08.822
SAM: No, that does help, that sort of paints them

4412
03:17:08.822 --> 03:17:13.096
as being innocent collectors of antiquities.

4413
03:17:13.096 --> 03:17:14.819
MATT: "I wouldn't say they're innocent."

4414
03:17:14.819 --> 03:17:19.715
SAM: Well, more interested in the object <i>objet d' art</i>

4415
03:17:19.715 --> 03:17:22.351
than the actual use of them.

4416
03:17:22.351 --> 03:17:27.201
MATT: "That I would think would be a little more viable."

4417
03:17:31.005 --> 03:17:34.988
TRAVIS: So should we head back to Pumat's?

4418
03:17:34.988 --> 03:17:37.471
SAM: Yes, I think so.

4419
03:17:37.471 --> 03:17:38.897
MATT: All right.

4420
03:17:38.897 --> 03:17:42.490
You guys make your way out of the Gentleman's lair,

4421
03:17:42.490 --> 03:17:46.011
up to the streets of Zadash, and the morning is yours,

4422
03:17:46.011 --> 03:17:48.606
you make your way towards the Pentamarket.

4423
03:17:48.606 --> 03:17:50.817
Is there any place you want to
stop on the way to Pentamarket,

4424
03:17:50.817 --> 03:17:52.672
or just bee-line there?

4425
03:17:52.672 --> 03:17:55.306
TRAVIS: On the way out, we'll check to see if there's anyone

4426
03:17:55.306 --> 03:17:57.925
waiting to see who exits this establishment.

4427
03:17:57.925 --> 03:18:00.140
MATT: Perception check.

4428
03:18:00.140 --> 03:18:03.415
LAURA: Eyes open the whole fucking time.

4429
03:18:03.415 --> 03:18:05.198
LIAM: My eyes are closed.

4430
03:18:05.198 --> 03:18:07.026
TRAVIS: 18.
LAURA: That's just dumb, Caleb.

4431
03:18:07.026 --> 03:18:09.135
You should really be looking.

4432
03:18:09.135 --> 03:18:12.478
MATT: Nobody seems to be expecting
or shifting once you arrive.

4433
03:18:12.478 --> 03:18:14.661
The city is busy,

4434
03:18:16.036 --> 03:18:18.540
and the presence of Crownsguard

4435
03:18:18.540 --> 03:18:23.540
and Righteous Brand is a little more robust

4436
03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:26.825
than the first time you had come to this city.

4437
03:18:26.825 --> 03:18:29.167
Being a time of war, it seems like there is definitely

4438
03:18:29.167 --> 03:18:32.198
an intent to magnify or focus

4439
03:18:32.198 --> 03:18:34.661
a lot of that protective aspects to the larger cities,

4440
03:18:34.661 --> 03:18:37.884
so Zadash being one of them, definitely has larger presence.

4441
03:18:37.884 --> 03:18:40.216
But nobody seems to be paying you specific mind

4442
03:18:40.216 --> 03:18:45.216
beyond just the occasional glances from passersby.

4443
03:18:45.940 --> 03:18:48.190
LIAM: Do we have criers crying?

4444
03:18:49.207 --> 03:18:51.177
MATT: Immediately, no, but if you continue to travel,

4445
03:18:51.177 --> 03:18:53.927
you can eventually begin to hear things

4446
03:18:53.927 --> 03:18:55.900
like one town crier in the distance,

4447
03:18:55.900 --> 03:18:57.817
you hear, shouting out,

4448
03:18:59.503 --> 03:19:03.258
"War front, positive successes in the east!

4449
03:19:03.258 --> 03:19:06.841
"Ashguard Garrison reclaimed for the Empire!"

4450
03:19:08.274 --> 03:19:10.431
TALIESIN: Interesting note, there is actually a standard

4451
03:19:10.431 --> 03:19:13.298
accent for all criers in every town.

4452
03:19:13.298 --> 03:19:14.298
MATT: It's true.

4453
03:19:15.354 --> 03:19:16.312
They hire based on it.

4454
03:19:16.312 --> 03:19:19.645
SAM: They all have a high bari-tenor voice.

4455
03:19:21.501 --> 03:19:23.893
MATT: "We were all raised

4456
03:19:23.893 --> 03:19:27.038
"in the crier pits to the west."

4457
03:19:27.038 --> 03:19:31.749
SAM: Jessie, there's no interest

4458
03:19:31.749 --> 03:19:35.261
in going to the Pillow Trove to check it out or anything?

4459
03:19:35.261 --> 03:19:36.584
You didn't have any packages.

4460
03:19:36.584 --> 03:19:38.323
Did you have any packages coming?

4461
03:19:38.323 --> 03:19:40.056
LAURA: Well, Nott.

4462
03:19:40.966 --> 03:19:43.161
SAM: Is that a no, or are you saying my name?

4463
03:19:43.161 --> 03:19:44.116
LAURA: I'm saying your name.

4464
03:19:44.116 --> 03:19:45.561
SAM: Okay.

4465
03:19:45.561 --> 03:19:46.794
LAURA: We sent...

4466
03:19:48.426 --> 03:19:49.267
LIAM: Yeah, I'm right here.

4467
03:19:49.267 --> 03:19:51.541
What are you doing?
SAM: Just keep walking.

4468
03:19:51.541 --> 03:19:53.036
TALIESIN: We're all walking, I think.

4469
03:19:53.036 --> 03:19:55.467
LAURA: Well yeah, but I want to hang back a little bit.

4470
03:19:55.467 --> 03:19:57.487
TALIESIN: Are we walking to the Pillow Trove?

4471
03:19:57.487 --> 03:19:58.320
LAURA: Yeah, we talk about girl stuff.

4472
03:19:58.320 --> 03:19:59.569
SAM: We're having periods right now.

4473
03:19:59.569 --> 03:20:01.144
LAURA: Yeah, we're both on it.

4474
03:20:01.144 --> 03:20:02.237
LIAM: I push the boys forward.

4475
03:20:02.237 --> 03:20:03.958
Ooh, look at this. I don't know what we're going to,

4476
03:20:03.958 --> 03:20:05.166
but come on.

4477
03:20:05.166 --> 03:20:08.630
MARISHA: I'm getting swept up-- I feel-- okay.

4478
03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:12.878
MATT: You guys admire the harvest-themed decorations

4479
03:20:12.878 --> 03:20:16.739
throughout the city, the brown and red

4480
03:20:16.739 --> 03:20:18.769
and golden tapestries, and you can see

4481
03:20:18.769 --> 03:20:23.769
there are some decorations that show the recent Harvest's--

4482
03:20:25.891 --> 03:20:28.224
what is it? Here it is, the--

4483
03:20:28.224 --> 03:20:30.787
the Harvest's Rise Festival was but a day,

4484
03:20:30.787 --> 03:20:32.271
two days ago, I think,

4485
03:20:32.271 --> 03:20:33.777
so there's still decorations up,

4486
03:20:33.777 --> 03:20:35.783
and there's still elements of celebration around.

4487
03:20:35.783 --> 03:20:36.858
MARISHA: We missed the Festival.

4488
03:20:36.858 --> 03:20:38.295
LIAM: Yeah, Neil Young played.

4489
03:20:38.295 --> 03:20:39.871
MARISHA: Bummer.

4490
03:20:39.871 --> 03:20:41.644
MATT: Anyway, conversation.

4491
03:20:41.644 --> 03:20:45.123
LAURA: So remember the letter that we sent to Astrid?

4492
03:20:45.123 --> 03:20:46.430
SAM: Of course I remember the letter

4493
03:20:46.430 --> 03:20:48.044
that we sent to Astrid, yes.

4494
03:20:48.044 --> 03:20:50.264
LAURA: Well, we told her to send something back

4495
03:20:50.264 --> 03:20:52.472
to the Pillow Trove.

4496
03:20:52.472 --> 03:20:54.426
SAM: Send something back, is that what we did?

4497
03:20:54.426 --> 03:20:55.728
LAURA: She said-- we told her we'd be staying

4498
03:20:55.728 --> 03:20:57.114
at the Pillow Trove.

4499
03:20:57.114 --> 03:20:59.667
SAM: It's a hotel, we're not going to stay there forever.

4500
03:20:59.667 --> 03:21:00.915
Should we check?

4501
03:21:00.915 --> 03:21:03.604
LAURA: Let me send a message to the proprietor

4502
03:21:03.604 --> 03:21:06.729
of the Pillow Trove.
MATT: Okay.

4503
03:21:06.729 --> 03:21:10.523
LAURA: Hello, it's Jester Lavore.

4504
03:21:10.523 --> 03:21:14.142
Just wondering if we have any packages there for me,

4505
03:21:14.142 --> 03:21:16.286
or Nott the Brave.

4506
03:21:16.286 --> 03:21:18.344
SAM: What did we sign the letter?

4507
03:21:20.365 --> 03:21:22.079
It was a legal firm.

4508
03:21:22.079 --> 03:21:24.865
LAURA: Yeah, Nott and Brave Legal.

4509
03:21:24.865 --> 03:21:28.227
SAM: Lavore? (laughs)

4510
03:21:28.227 --> 03:21:31.144
LIAM: It's like a lawyer title, like a law office.

4511
03:21:32.407 --> 03:21:35.138
MATT: Madame Luenna responds, and says,

4512
03:21:35.138 --> 03:21:38.104
"It appears there is package present

4513
03:21:38.104 --> 03:21:42.773
"for a Nott and Brave,

4514
03:21:42.773 --> 03:21:46.002
"it is attention to a Lavore."

4515
03:21:46.002 --> 03:21:47.502
TALIESIN: You've got mail.

4516
03:21:49.167 --> 03:21:50.937
LAURA: (squeaks)

4517
03:21:50.937 --> 03:21:52.369
SAM: Wait, is that good?

4518
03:21:52.369 --> 03:21:53.477
LAURA: No!

4519
03:21:53.477 --> 03:21:55.935
I mean, not until we know what's going on.

4520
03:21:55.935 --> 03:21:57.336
Oh my god, we have to tell everybody what we did.

4521
03:21:57.336 --> 03:22:00.434
SAM: An enemy sent us a love letter or something?

4522
03:22:00.434 --> 03:22:02.692
LAURA: I don't know what they responded.

4523
03:22:02.692 --> 03:22:04.058
Oh my god.

4524
03:22:05.457 --> 03:22:07.871
SAM: You know, people are complicated.

4525
03:22:07.871 --> 03:22:09.716
She could be a murderer,

4526
03:22:09.716 --> 03:22:13.549
but also have a flourishing pen pal love life.

4527
03:22:15.196 --> 03:22:16.683
LAURA: What did we say in the letter?

4528
03:22:16.683 --> 03:22:18.606
SAM: I don't remember!
LAURA: I don't either!

4529
03:22:18.606 --> 03:22:22.001
SAM: I was very drunk at the time.

4530
03:22:22.001 --> 03:22:24.695
LAURA: Nott, you talked me into it, I don't remember--

4531
03:22:24.695 --> 03:22:27.245
SAM: I think we said something like,
we want to meet Astrid because we have--

4532
03:22:27.245 --> 03:22:28.478
I think we were--

4533
03:22:28.478 --> 03:22:30.059
You know what it was?

4534
03:22:30.059 --> 03:22:32.435
We have the estate of your uncle,

4535
03:22:32.435 --> 03:22:36.187
and we want to give you some sort of will,

4536
03:22:36.187 --> 03:22:37.917
you were left something in a will.

4537
03:22:37.917 --> 03:22:39.591
LAURA: That's the dumbest thing. That's, like, the stupid--

4538
03:22:39.591 --> 03:22:42.500
SAM: Apparently it worked! (laughs)

4539
03:22:42.500 --> 03:22:45.378
LAURA: What if the thing back is like--

4540
03:22:45.378 --> 03:22:47.727
SAM: A human hand!
LAURA: Yeah!

4541
03:22:47.727 --> 03:22:49.422
Like, if it's poison or something,

4542
03:22:49.422 --> 03:22:51.822
something that will explode as soon as we open it.

4543
03:22:51.822 --> 03:22:53.415
LIAM: Could be.
TALIESIN: Could be.

4544
03:22:53.415 --> 03:22:57.459
SAM: I've got Mage Hand, and we'll have Caduceus open it.

4545
03:22:57.459 --> 03:23:00.981
LAURA: How about you just check for traps?

4546
03:23:00.981 --> 03:23:02.306
SAM: I can do that, too.

4547
03:23:02.306 --> 03:23:04.482
Always check for traps.
LAURA: Always check for traps.

4548
03:23:04.482 --> 03:23:06.310
SAM: I've died a lot lately.

4549
03:23:06.310 --> 03:23:08.765
LAURA: I know, how are you feeling about that?

4550
03:23:08.765 --> 03:23:10.348
SAM: Real bad.
LAURA: Yeah.

4551
03:23:11.299 --> 03:23:12.373
SAM: Yeah, real bad.

4552
03:23:12.373 --> 03:23:13.549
LAURA: Okay.

4553
03:23:13.549 --> 03:23:15.168
SAM: All right, how do we tell the others

4554
03:23:15.168 --> 03:23:17.251
that we need to go there?
LAURA: We should just tell them.

4555
03:23:17.251 --> 03:23:19.520
TRAVIS: You've sort of been yelling the last 20 seconds.

4556
03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:21.443
SAM: Oh, hi guys!

4557
03:23:21.443 --> 03:23:23.218
Oh, these periods.

4558
03:23:24.396 --> 03:23:26.193
TRAVIS: Cray, huh? Yeah.

4559
03:23:26.193 --> 03:23:28.676
SAM: Anyway, we have some...

4560
03:23:28.676 --> 03:23:30.926
we have some intel.

4561
03:23:30.926 --> 03:23:33.791
We have some intel we need to discuss with you.

4562
03:23:33.791 --> 03:23:35.675
We might have to just make a quick little swing

4563
03:23:35.675 --> 03:23:37.602
around the Pillow Trove.

4564
03:23:38.502 --> 03:23:39.382
LIAM: A hotel?

4565
03:23:39.382 --> 03:23:40.215
LAURA: Yeah.

4566
03:23:40.215 --> 03:23:41.814
SAM: Remember, a while ago, I let you know

4567
03:23:41.814 --> 03:23:44.980
that we had reached out to, oh boy,

4568
03:23:44.980 --> 03:23:46.837
I can't even remember her name, what was her name?

4569
03:23:46.837 --> 03:23:48.068
LAURA: It was something starts with--

4570
03:23:48.068 --> 03:23:49.856
SAM: Asa something, I don't--

4571
03:23:49.856 --> 03:23:52.339
LAURA: Astrid?
SAM: Oh yeah, you know what?

4572
03:23:52.339 --> 03:23:54.319
It was Astrid.

4573
03:23:54.319 --> 03:23:55.765
We reached out to Astrid.

4574
03:23:55.765 --> 03:23:57.633
LAURA: We told you about that, you know that.

4575
03:23:57.633 --> 03:24:00.558
SAM: And apparently, she's written back.

4576
03:24:00.558 --> 03:24:01.867
LAURA: Maybe.

4577
03:24:01.867 --> 03:24:04.367
Or somebody else from the Academy.

4578
03:24:07.906 --> 03:24:09.759
LIAM: Interesting.

4579
03:24:09.759 --> 03:24:13.728
LAURA: Yeah so, the package is at the Pillow Trove.

4580
03:24:13.728 --> 03:24:14.898
TRAVIS: A package?

4581
03:24:14.898 --> 03:24:15.991
LAURA: Yeah, it's a package.

4582
03:24:15.991 --> 03:24:17.986
TRAVIS: You reached out to Astrid--

4583
03:24:17.986 --> 03:24:20.164
LAURA: But this is when we thought that she was just somebody

4584
03:24:20.164 --> 03:24:22.389
that Caleb loved and he wasn't talking to her.

4585
03:24:22.389 --> 03:24:23.797
SAM: We thought it was an ex.

4586
03:24:23.797 --> 03:24:25.516
We thought we were doing Caleb a favor.

4587
03:24:25.516 --> 03:24:29.092
It turns out, we were contacting our enemy.

4588
03:24:29.092 --> 03:24:31.743
LAURA: But we didn't know at the time.

4589
03:24:31.743 --> 03:24:32.897
TRAVIS: Right.

4590
03:24:32.897 --> 03:24:37.048
How do you propose to go and collect this package?

4591
03:24:37.048 --> 03:24:39.747
LAURA: I'm sure she's not keeping an eye on the Pillow Tr--

4592
03:24:39.747 --> 03:24:41.519
it's been a long time, who knows how long

4593
03:24:41.519 --> 03:24:44.303
this package has been here.

4594
03:24:44.303 --> 03:24:46.039
Disguise Self!
SAM: Disguise Self.

4595
03:24:46.039 --> 03:24:48.798
LAURA: Just go in as somebody else.
SAM: You could Disguise Self.

4596
03:24:48.798 --> 03:24:50.721
TRAVIS: I can.
LAURA: And say you're picking it up

4597
03:24:50.721 --> 03:24:53.485
on behalf of the Nott and Brave.

4598
03:24:53.485 --> 03:24:54.759
LIAM: I should go.

4599
03:24:54.759 --> 03:24:56.725
LAURA: What are you talking about, Caleb?

4600
03:24:56.725 --> 03:24:59.760
LIAM: I should go, because I cannot be found.

4601
03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:01.334
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

4602
03:25:01.334 --> 03:25:02.834
TRAVIS: Caleb should go.

4603
03:25:03.844 --> 03:25:06.189
SAM: You can also disguise yourself, correct?

4604
03:25:06.189 --> 03:25:09.455
LIAM: Yeah, I should disguise myself as you.

4605
03:25:09.455 --> 03:25:10.359
LAURA: Why me?

4606
03:25:10.359 --> 03:25:11.989
LIAM: Because it's addressed to you.

4607
03:25:11.989 --> 03:25:13.753
SAM: The package is for you and me.

4608
03:25:13.753 --> 03:25:15.518
LAURA: Oh, well, that's true.

4609
03:25:15.518 --> 03:25:17.605
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4610
03:25:17.605 --> 03:25:19.318
TALIESIN: Good money if it's from the Cobalt Soul

4611
03:25:19.318 --> 03:25:20.851
trying to sell you life insurance.

4612
03:25:20.851 --> 03:25:23.072
That will give really good money if it's just junk mail.

4613
03:25:23.072 --> 03:25:24.637
MARISHA: It's actually not a bad deal.

4614
03:25:24.637 --> 03:25:25.470
LAURA: Don't open it though,

4615
03:25:25.470 --> 03:25:27.509
because it could explode with poison.

4616
03:25:27.509 --> 03:25:29.282
SAM: Yeah, just bring it back.

4617
03:25:29.282 --> 03:25:32.891
LIAM: The thought had already occurred to me.

4618
03:25:32.891 --> 03:25:34.557
LAURA: So yeah, let's swing by The Pillow Trove

4619
03:25:34.557 --> 03:25:37.030
on the way over to Pumat's, yeah?

4620
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:38.256
SAM: Yeah.

4621
03:25:38.256 --> 03:25:40.725
MARISHA: Did they say anything about the package,

4622
03:25:40.725 --> 03:25:45.019
like anything specific, it's not like ticking?

4623
03:25:45.019 --> 03:25:46.893
LIAM: Size?
TRAVIS: What would tick?

4624
03:25:46.893 --> 03:25:48.060
What's a tick?

4625
03:25:49.281 --> 03:25:52.156
SAM: When Jester does her messaging--

4626
03:25:52.156 --> 03:25:53.689
when Jester does her messaging

4627
03:25:53.689 --> 03:25:55.529
she doesn't get a lot of detail back,

4628
03:25:55.529 --> 03:25:56.980
it's just like a yes or no,

4629
03:25:56.980 --> 03:26:00.609
and then stop looking at me, I'm pooping sort of a thing.

4630
03:26:00.609 --> 03:26:02.657
MARISHA: I mean, that's detail.

4631
03:26:02.657 --> 03:26:04.260
LIAM: Do we have that--

4632
03:26:04.260 --> 03:26:05.653
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's like a request and an observation.

4633
03:26:05.653 --> 03:26:08.861
LIAM: That stone, that device?

4634
03:26:08.861 --> 03:26:10.408
SAM: That you throw and dispel something with?

4635
03:26:10.408 --> 03:26:12.074
LIAM: No, no, no, no.

4636
03:26:13.515 --> 03:26:16.454
That projects sound.

4637
03:26:16.454 --> 03:26:18.419
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: What does that do?

4638
03:26:18.419 --> 03:26:19.410
We've used that once.

4639
03:26:19.410 --> 03:26:21.002
LAURA: Yeah, you can make a recording.

4640
03:26:21.002 --> 03:26:22.714
I pull it out and go,

4641
03:26:22.714 --> 03:26:26.389
Caleb doesn't smell bad at all anymore,

4642
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:27.792
and then I put down.

4643
03:26:27.792 --> 03:26:30.166
LIAM: We have established that I am not able to--

4644
03:26:30.166 --> 03:26:31.702
LAURA: And 30 seconds later, you hear,

4645
03:26:31.702 --> 03:26:34.408
"Caleb doesn't smell bad at all anymore."

4646
03:26:35.325 --> 03:26:37.255
And I didn't even say that just then.

4647
03:26:37.255 --> 03:26:38.088
That came from the rock.

4648
03:26:38.088 --> 03:26:39.963
SAM: I think he wants you to record something like,

4649
03:26:39.963 --> 03:26:42.627
"I'm Jester, I'm here for my package."

4650
03:26:42.627 --> 03:26:44.377
TRAVIS: "I'm Teddy Ruxpin!

4651
03:26:44.377 --> 03:26:45.726
"Do you love me?"

4652
03:26:45.726 --> 03:26:47.319
SAM: "Do you want to meet my friend?"

4653
03:26:47.319 --> 03:26:48.841
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

4654
03:26:48.841 --> 03:26:52.143
LIAM: Hold on, let's group think this one.

4655
03:26:52.143 --> 03:26:54.260
Everybody, please, because we have established

4656
03:26:54.260 --> 03:26:57.407
that I am not the best with accents.
SAM: I think you're great.

4657
03:26:57.407 --> 03:27:01.207
LIAM: But it needs to be
something that could repeat believably.

4658
03:27:01.207 --> 03:27:03.401
You follow?
MARISHA: Belief-ably?

4659
03:27:03.401 --> 03:27:05.252
LAURA: So what, is it supposed to be like--

4660
03:27:05.252 --> 03:27:06.650
TRAVIS: "My name is Jester Lavore."

4661
03:27:06.650 --> 03:27:08.446
LAURA: "I'm here to pick up a package."

4662
03:27:08.446 --> 03:27:10.824
Then I'll wait a little bit, and I'll go, "Yeah."

4663
03:27:10.824 --> 03:27:13.368
SAM: Then maybe like a "thank you" or something,

4664
03:27:13.368 --> 03:27:14.541
like Ferris Bueller.

4665
03:27:14.541 --> 03:27:16.220
LAURA: Yeah, like Ferris Bueller.

4666
03:27:16.220 --> 03:27:17.629
Okay, so I'm going to do that,

4667
03:27:17.629 --> 03:27:20.356
I'm going to say, "Hello, my name is Jester Lavore,

4668
03:27:20.356 --> 03:27:22.732
"I'm here to pick up a package for me."

4669
03:27:22.732 --> 03:27:25.188
SAM: Oh I have the package right here, here you go.

4670
03:27:25.188 --> 03:27:26.713
LAURA: "Oh, thank you so much."

4671
03:27:26.713 --> 03:27:28.375
SAM: Will there be anything else?

4672
03:27:28.375 --> 03:27:31.537
LAURA: "No, that will be all for today, thank you."

4673
03:27:31.537 --> 03:27:33.084
SAM: Okay, bye!

4674
03:27:33.084 --> 03:27:33.958
TRAVIS: Mild problem.

4675
03:27:33.958 --> 03:27:35.805
I do believe the stone probably picked up

4676
03:27:35.805 --> 03:27:36.864
what <i>you</i> were saying,

4677
03:27:36.864 --> 03:27:38.911
so maybe you should get a clean take?

4678
03:27:38.911 --> 03:27:41.427
SAM: I was saying it very quietly.

4679
03:27:41.427 --> 03:27:44.101
LAURA: Yeah, I don't remember what we did.

4680
03:27:44.101 --> 03:27:45.396
MATT: We'll say at this point you guys have approached

4681
03:27:45.396 --> 03:27:47.696
the exterior of The Pillow Trove.

4682
03:27:49.447 --> 03:27:51.828
TALIESIN: Is anyone looking suspiciously at us,

4683
03:27:51.828 --> 03:27:53.808
like they're waiting for us, or does it feel like a trap?

4684
03:27:53.808 --> 03:27:55.507
MATT: Continuing the rolls that you guys have had

4685
03:27:55.507 --> 03:27:56.536
for the whole journey here,

4686
03:27:56.536 --> 03:27:57.855
it does not appear that anybody is doing that,

4687
03:27:57.855 --> 03:27:59.223
from what you can tell.

4688
03:27:59.223 --> 03:28:01.607
LIAM: Let's back it up a block or two,

4689
03:28:01.607 --> 03:28:05.024
and maybe make the fragments of dialogue,

4690
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:09.812
speaking as someone who has adapted many anime scripts,

4691
03:28:09.812 --> 03:28:11.684
keep the pieces succinct,

4692
03:28:12.551 --> 03:28:14.943
so they can be repeated logically.

4693
03:28:16.168 --> 03:28:18.942
LAURA: "Hello, my name is Jester Lavore.

4694
03:28:18.942 --> 03:28:20.968
"I'm here to pick up a package.

4695
03:28:21.851 --> 03:28:22.851
"Thank you.

4696
03:28:23.903 --> 03:28:24.736
"Yes?

4697
03:28:26.811 --> 03:28:27.727
"Mm-hmm.

4698
03:28:29.292 --> 03:28:30.292
"Thank you.

4699
03:28:32.341 --> 03:28:34.091
"No, that will be all.

4700
03:28:35.410 --> 03:28:36.243
"Okay, bye.

4701
03:28:37.365 --> 03:28:38.509
"Mm-hmm."

4702
03:28:38.509 --> 03:28:40.430
LIAM: We will never remember that.

4703
03:28:40.430 --> 03:28:42.180
SAM: She will remember that.

4704
03:28:42.180 --> 03:28:43.963
She will remember that.

4705
03:28:43.963 --> 03:28:45.288
MATT: So you receive the stone.

4706
03:28:45.288 --> 03:28:46.577
LIAM: Yeah, and so, this works

4707
03:28:46.577 --> 03:28:48.899
by giving it a little squeeze, right?

4708
03:28:48.899 --> 03:28:49.732
Or does it just go?

4709
03:28:49.732 --> 03:28:50.565
LAURA: It goes.

4710
03:28:50.565 --> 03:28:52.103
LIAM: It just goes.

4711
03:28:52.103 --> 03:28:54.977
MATT: It repeats every 10 minutes.

4712
03:28:54.977 --> 03:28:56.714
MARISHA: Oh, 10 minutes.

4713
03:28:56.714 --> 03:28:58.195
LIAM: That's better.

4714
03:28:58.195 --> 03:28:59.706
LAURA: I'm going to look, I think it's every--

4715
03:28:59.706 --> 03:29:00.839
MARISHA: I think it's 10.

4716
03:29:00.839 --> 03:29:03.143
TRAVIS: I have mm-hmm, yes, mm-hmm, yes,

4717
03:29:03.143 --> 03:29:04.639
and I lost it after that.

4718
03:29:04.639 --> 03:29:06.436
SAM: There was also "My name's Jester Lavore."

4719
03:29:06.436 --> 03:29:09.375
LAURA: "I'm here to pick up a package," yeah.

4720
03:29:09.375 --> 03:29:10.689
TRAVIS: So we have--

4721
03:29:10.689 --> 03:29:13.162
MARISHA: If we ever want to torture somebody, by the way--

4722
03:29:13.162 --> 03:29:15.580
LAURA: Five minutes.
MATT: There we go, okay.

4723
03:29:15.580 --> 03:29:19.485
MARISHA: We could just record Nott's scream into it.

4724
03:29:19.485 --> 03:29:21.137
TRAVIS: So down for this.

4725
03:29:21.137 --> 03:29:22.907
MARISHA: Leave it in the diplomat's bedroom.

4726
03:29:22.907 --> 03:29:25.806
LAURA: Really try to remember, just muffle--

4727
03:29:25.806 --> 03:29:26.697
TRAVIS: Do you need a backup?

4728
03:29:26.697 --> 03:29:28.186
LIAM: We could go ape-shit on this

4729
03:29:28.186 --> 03:29:31.561
and have you record it into a phone, for the fun of it.

4730
03:29:34.132 --> 03:29:36.092
It'd be pretty great.
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm into that.

4731
03:29:36.092 --> 03:29:37.463
MATT: Or she can live repeat it.

4732
03:29:37.463 --> 03:29:39.177
LAURA: Yeah, exactly.

4733
03:29:39.177 --> 03:29:41.382
LIAM: Okay, that will be great.

4734
03:29:41.382 --> 03:29:43.778
MATT: All right, so, you transform into--

4735
03:29:43.778 --> 03:29:47.690
LAURA: Yeah, absolutely, I'm a little blue tiefling

4736
03:29:47.690 --> 03:29:49.222
who likes pastries,

4737
03:29:49.222 --> 03:29:52.842
and it's every, what did we say, five or 10 minutes?

4738
03:29:52.842 --> 03:29:54.123
Five minutes?

4739
03:29:54.123 --> 03:29:57.506
So I hold everyone out here for...

4740
03:29:57.506 --> 03:29:59.334
15 minutes

4741
03:29:59.334 --> 03:30:02.812
and I try my best to absorb it.

4742
03:30:02.812 --> 03:30:03.803
I'm never--

4743
03:30:03.803 --> 03:30:07.215
Liam has no memory, I am never going to be able to remember.

4744
03:30:07.215 --> 03:30:08.723
MATT: Roll a deception roll.

4745
03:30:08.723 --> 03:30:09.813
SAM: And lip-sync.

4746
03:30:09.813 --> 03:30:13.735
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, I'm giving you a little bit of Guidance.

4747
03:30:13.735 --> 03:30:16.236
LIAM: I'm going to, before going in,

4748
03:30:16.236 --> 03:30:19.411
cast some Dunamancy on my--

4749
03:30:19.411 --> 03:30:21.135
no I'm not.

4750
03:30:21.135 --> 03:30:22.536
LAURA: Oh, right.

4751
03:30:22.536 --> 03:30:26.878
That's okay, I'm going to cast Enhance Abilities on you.

4752
03:30:26.878 --> 03:30:29.578
LIAM: Are there any alleyways around here?

4753
03:30:30.884 --> 03:30:32.488
MATT: I mean, there're not any tight alleyways.

4754
03:30:32.488 --> 03:30:34.285
Actually, the Tri-Spire's pretty open,

4755
03:30:34.285 --> 03:30:35.590
because it's one of the more affluent areas.

4756
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:37.282
There's no super tight alleys.

4757
03:30:37.282 --> 03:30:38.764
LIAM: Okay, forget it.

4758
03:30:38.764 --> 03:30:40.607
TALIESIN: You got some Guidance.

4759
03:30:40.607 --> 03:30:42.375
LIAM: I've got some Guidance.

4760
03:30:42.375 --> 03:30:45.213
MATT: You have about 30 seconds until it repeats itself.

4761
03:30:45.213 --> 03:30:46.793
LIAM: That's not good.

4762
03:30:46.793 --> 03:30:48.147
TALIESIN: Add a d4.

4763
03:30:48.147 --> 03:30:49.378
LIAM: Still not good.
LAURA: But you're outside,

4764
03:30:49.378 --> 03:30:50.552
you're just practicing right now.

4765
03:30:50.552 --> 03:30:51.702
MATT: You're just practicing.

4766
03:30:51.702 --> 03:30:53.697
LIAM: Okay, and you said deception, right?

4767
03:30:53.697 --> 03:30:55.255
MATT: Yeah.

4768
03:30:55.255 --> 03:30:57.471
LIAM: Oh, I have a high deception, I forgot.

4769
03:30:57.471 --> 03:30:58.508
16.

4770
03:30:58.508 --> 03:31:00.177
MATT: Actually, Caleb's not doing bad.

4771
03:31:00.177 --> 03:31:02.486
After the second pass or so, he's doing pretty well.

4772
03:31:02.486 --> 03:31:04.961
LAURA: See, Caleb, you're doing great.

4773
03:31:08.565 --> 03:31:11.545
All right, I think you're ready.
TRAVIS: No time like the present.

4774
03:31:11.545 --> 03:31:14.059
LAURA: I'm going to, before he goes in,

4775
03:31:14.059 --> 03:31:18.021
cast Enhance Ability on charisma checks.

4776
03:31:18.021 --> 03:31:19.471
SAM: Nice.
MATT: Okay.

4777
03:31:19.471 --> 03:31:20.788
TALIESIN: I'm tapping you with Guidance

4778
03:31:20.788 --> 03:31:24.223
right before we send you on your way.

4779
03:31:24.223 --> 03:31:25.952
LIAM: Wildmother, come with me.
MATT: Guidance lasts for--

4780
03:31:25.952 --> 03:31:26.917
TALIESIN: One minute.

4781
03:31:26.917 --> 03:31:27.841
MATT: Okay.

4782
03:31:27.841 --> 03:31:30.603
You enter, and you find your way to the front area,

4783
03:31:30.603 --> 03:31:34.576
and you can see, there's a clerk there, who goes,

4784
03:31:34.576 --> 03:31:36.370
"Hello, can I help you?"

4785
03:31:36.370 --> 03:31:39.287
LAURA: "Hello, my name is Jester Lavore.

4786
03:31:40.147 --> 03:31:42.471
"I'm here to pick up a package."

4787
03:31:42.471 --> 03:31:43.908
MATT: "Oh, all right, I'll go check for it for you."

4788
03:31:43.908 --> 03:31:45.125
LAURA: "Thank you.

4789
03:31:46.764 --> 03:31:48.995
"Yes."
MATT: "Hmm, what's up?

4790
03:31:48.995 --> 03:31:49.828
"Can I help you?"

4791
03:31:49.828 --> 03:31:51.021
LAURA: "Thank you."

4792
03:31:51.021 --> 03:31:51.962
MATT: "Oh, all right.

4793
03:31:51.962 --> 03:31:53.387
"Is there anything else you need?"

4794
03:31:53.387 --> 03:31:54.467
LAURA: "Yes."

4795
03:31:54.467 --> 03:31:56.160
MATT: "Okay, what can I help you with?"

4796
03:31:56.160 --> 03:31:58.047
LAURA: "Mm-hmm."

4797
03:31:58.047 --> 03:32:00.157
MATT: "I didn't get that."

4798
03:32:00.157 --> 03:32:00.990
LAURA: "No."

4799
03:32:02.475 --> 03:32:05.510
MATT: "Okay, I'll look for the package."

4800
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:06.916
SAM: Bye.

4801
03:32:06.916 --> 03:32:08.371
(laughter)

4802
03:32:08.371 --> 03:32:10.183
MATT: Roll a deception check.

4803
03:32:10.183 --> 03:32:12.532
With advantage and a d4. (laughs)

4804
03:32:12.532 --> 03:32:14.037
SAM: (as Jester) Okay, bye.

4805
03:32:14.037 --> 03:32:15.437
LAURA: "Okay, bye."

4806
03:32:16.770 --> 03:32:17.853
LIAM: Good stuff. Good stuff.

4807
03:32:21.468 --> 03:32:23.091
27.

4808
03:32:23.091 --> 03:32:24.446
MATT: Okay.

4809
03:32:24.446 --> 03:32:25.599
LAURA: Shit.

4810
03:32:25.599 --> 03:32:26.714
TALIESIN: (laughs)

4811
03:32:26.714 --> 03:32:28.463
MATT: Pretty good.

4812
03:32:28.463 --> 03:32:30.952
A few moments later,

4813
03:32:30.952 --> 03:32:32.752
you end up waiting a good, like...

4814
03:32:34.360 --> 03:32:36.184
13 minutes.

4815
03:32:36.184 --> 03:32:38.601
SAM: So it repeats a few times.

4816
03:32:40.316 --> 03:32:41.575
TALIESIN: Squeeze it to make it stop.

4817
03:32:41.575 --> 03:32:43.353
MATT: Yeah.

4818
03:32:43.353 --> 03:32:46.827
Eventually, she returns with a single envelope.

4819
03:32:46.827 --> 03:32:48.316
Not so a package, more of an envelope,

4820
03:32:48.316 --> 03:32:51.316
and goes, "I believe this is what you were...

4821
03:32:52.377 --> 03:32:53.527
"looking up.

4822
03:32:55.919 --> 03:32:57.836
"Anything else you need?

4823
03:32:58.936 --> 03:33:00.472
"Very well.

4824
03:33:00.472 --> 03:33:01.548
"Have a good day."

4825
03:33:01.548 --> 03:33:03.131
And sits back down.

4826
03:33:04.411 --> 03:33:06.822
(laughter)

4827
03:33:06.822 --> 03:33:07.655
All right.

4828
03:33:07.655 --> 03:33:10.485
You walk outside and join the rest of your compatriots.

4829
03:33:10.485 --> 03:33:12.894
LIAM: Everybody sees Jester's form come out,

4830
03:33:12.894 --> 03:33:16.161
and as soon as the door closes (sighs).

4831
03:33:16.161 --> 03:33:18.053
Oh.
LAURA: How'd you do?

4832
03:33:19.372 --> 03:33:20.326
SAM: You got it!

4833
03:33:20.326 --> 03:33:22.182
LAURA: Hey, good job!

4834
03:33:22.182 --> 03:33:23.655
Should we open it, check for traps.

4835
03:33:23.655 --> 03:33:25.156
SAM: Oh, great idea.

4836
03:33:25.156 --> 03:33:26.908
LIAM: Maybe not right here in the thoroughfare,

4837
03:33:26.908 --> 03:33:29.668
says the little blue tiefling.

4838
03:33:29.668 --> 03:33:31.939
MARISHA: Hey, there's two of you right now.

4839
03:33:31.939 --> 03:33:34.016
LAURA: There's two of me.

4840
03:33:34.016 --> 03:33:36.039
This is what it always feels like.

4841
03:33:36.039 --> 03:33:36.872
See?

4842
03:33:39.070 --> 03:33:41.262
LIAM: Fuck this. Come on, where are we going?
SAM: Let's go to an alley,

4843
03:33:41.262 --> 03:33:42.296
we find an alley.

4844
03:33:42.296 --> 03:33:44.610
MATT: So you leave the Tri-Spires to find a hidden alley?

4845
03:33:44.610 --> 03:33:47.331
LIAM: We need to go as far away as possible.

4846
03:33:47.331 --> 03:33:49.712
LAURA: Let's go to Pumat's and then open it.

4847
03:33:49.712 --> 03:33:51.212
SAM: Okay. To Pu.
MATT: All right,

4848
03:33:51.212 --> 03:33:53.934
you guys make your way to Pumat's in the Pentamarket.

4849
03:33:53.934 --> 03:33:56.851
The sign outside says "Closed" still,

4850
03:33:57.998 --> 03:34:01.601
so you approach the door-- (locked sound)

4851
03:34:01.601 --> 03:34:02.897
SAM: We knock?

4852
03:34:02.897 --> 03:34:05.461
LAURA: Knock, knock, knock!

4853
03:34:05.461 --> 03:34:08.383
TRAVIS: Is it about-- should it be open by now?

4854
03:34:08.383 --> 03:34:09.421
MATT: Yeah, usually.

4855
03:34:09.421 --> 03:34:10.254
LAURA: Oh no.

4856
03:34:11.711 --> 03:34:14.500
SAM: Do not kill Pumat Sol.
MARISHA: I will be so mad.

4857
03:34:14.500 --> 03:34:16.193
SAM: I will kill you.

4858
03:34:16.193 --> 03:34:18.757
LIAM: I pull out the magical copper wire

4859
03:34:18.757 --> 03:34:23.143
and say, Pumat Prime, we, your friends,

4860
03:34:23.143 --> 03:34:25.993
The Mighty Nein are here, are you possibly at home?

4861
03:34:29.253 --> 03:34:31.186
MATT: "Yeah, just getting a few things together here."

4862
03:34:31.186 --> 03:34:33.737
LAURA: Oh, you mother--
TRAVIS: Fucking bitch!

4863
03:34:33.737 --> 03:34:36.210
Nobody needs that!

4864
03:34:36.210 --> 03:34:37.342
Fuck!

4865
03:34:37.342 --> 03:34:38.858
LAURA: Matthew Mercer.

4866
03:34:38.858 --> 03:34:40.134
MATT: "I'll send one of the others down

4867
03:34:40.134 --> 03:34:42.198
"to get the door for ya."

4868
03:34:42.198 --> 03:34:43.961
Eventually, the door opens up,

4869
03:34:43.961 --> 03:34:45.972
one of the Pumats is there, goes,

4870
03:34:45.972 --> 03:34:47.768
"Welcome and good mornin', come on in.

4871
03:34:47.768 --> 03:34:51.569
"We were told to keep the place kind of, y'know,

4872
03:34:51.569 --> 03:34:53.226
"free of any other foot traffic,

4873
03:34:53.226 --> 03:34:55.377
"based on the intent of the day.

4874
03:34:55.377 --> 03:34:56.292
"Come on in."

4875
03:34:56.292 --> 03:34:58.694
LIAM: Still as Jester, I hope you don't mind us imposing,

4876
03:34:58.694 --> 03:35:01.070
is it all right if we come upstairs?

4877
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:02.895
We need a bit of privacy for a moment.

4878
03:35:02.895 --> 03:35:03.728
MATT: "Sure."

4879
03:35:03.728 --> 03:35:04.885
We hate to impose.

4880
03:35:04.885 --> 03:35:06.782
MATT: "I haven't heard the other one talk before."

4881
03:35:06.782 --> 03:35:08.089
LAURA: I know, right?

4882
03:35:08.089 --> 03:35:09.568
Normally, she doesn't.

4883
03:35:09.568 --> 03:35:10.950
LIAM: I'm learning.

4884
03:35:10.950 --> 03:35:13.153
We could take tips from you.

4885
03:35:13.153 --> 03:35:14.820
MATT: "Great, come on in."

4886
03:35:15.827 --> 03:35:16.743
So you guys come in.

4887
03:35:16.743 --> 03:35:17.878
The center tables were moved,

4888
03:35:17.878 --> 03:35:21.789
and you can see there's a space for scrying

4889
03:35:21.789 --> 03:35:24.019
already set in the center of the floor.

4890
03:35:24.019 --> 03:35:24.994
SAM: Cool.

4891
03:35:24.994 --> 03:35:28.483
MATT: You can see this beautiful crystal ball.

4892
03:35:28.483 --> 03:35:32.304
The focus you use for your Scry is very pretty,

4893
03:35:32.304 --> 03:35:34.954
but this is a very...

4894
03:35:34.954 --> 03:35:37.117
very, very nice

4895
03:35:37.117 --> 03:35:40.676
show model, if you will, set there,

4896
03:35:40.676 --> 03:35:43.171
and you can see a Pumat is in the process

4897
03:35:43.171 --> 03:35:45.136
of setting things.

4898
03:35:45.136 --> 03:35:49.642
"All right, yeah, so, you're alive, that's good.

4899
03:35:49.642 --> 03:35:51.047
"Guess it means the thing's not following you

4900
03:35:51.047 --> 03:35:53.046
"too far behind, right?"

4901
03:35:53.046 --> 03:35:54.796
LIAM: Less than 24 hours.

4902
03:35:57.265 --> 03:36:00.446
We're hoping to elicit your aid to find our friend,

4903
03:36:00.446 --> 03:36:03.088
but before we do that, we have a side task.

4904
03:36:03.088 --> 03:36:05.821
Do you mind if I set up shop in the corner for a moment?

4905
03:36:05.821 --> 03:36:08.789
I have to inspect some things.

4906
03:36:08.789 --> 03:36:10.372
MATT: "Sure, yeah."

4907
03:36:11.373 --> 03:36:12.660
LIAM: Nott the Brave.
SAM: Yes?

4908
03:36:12.660 --> 03:36:15.286
LIAM: Would you come over here with me?
SAM: Yes.

4909
03:36:15.286 --> 03:36:20.225
LIAM: So in a moment, I am going to see

4910
03:36:20.225 --> 03:36:24.190
if there is anything of an arcane nature to worry about,

4911
03:36:24.190 --> 03:36:25.160
but could you just check

4912
03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:29.021
for your run-of-the-mill physical traps?

4913
03:36:29.021 --> 03:36:31.848
SAM: I always check for traps.

4914
03:36:31.848 --> 03:36:33.234
TRAVIS: On the envelope?
SAM: On the envelope.

4915
03:36:33.234 --> 03:36:34.067
LIAM: Why not?

4916
03:36:35.555 --> 03:36:39.488
SAM: 29, plus a d4.

4917
03:36:40.972 --> 03:36:42.007
LAURA: Ooh.

4918
03:36:42.007 --> 03:36:43.300
SAM: 33.

4919
03:36:43.300 --> 03:36:44.512
MARISHA: Holy shit.

4920
03:36:44.512 --> 03:36:46.812
MATT: That envelope is

4921
03:36:46.812 --> 03:36:49.112
fucking not trapped.

4922
03:36:49.112 --> 03:36:51.235
You are so sure.

4923
03:36:51.235 --> 03:36:52.374
TALIESIN: We're all dead.

4924
03:36:52.374 --> 03:36:53.458
SAM: (ripping paper noise)

4925
03:36:53.458 --> 03:36:54.474
Good to go.

4926
03:36:54.474 --> 03:36:59.252
LIAM: Okay, so, I turn my back to the Pumats and his setup,

4927
03:36:59.252 --> 03:37:00.834
put the envelope down on the ground,

4928
03:37:00.834 --> 03:37:03.968
pull out my spell book, open it up to the correct page,

4929
03:37:03.968 --> 03:37:06.092
and spend the next 10 minutes

4930
03:37:06.092 --> 03:37:09.317
ritual-casting Detect Magic on it, just in case.

4931
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:13.275
TRAVIS: It's a fucking letter.

4932
03:37:13.275 --> 03:37:14.731
LIAM: It's fine.
MATT: You take 10 minutes,

4933
03:37:14.731 --> 03:37:17.231
you finish, it is not magical.

4934
03:37:18.692 --> 03:37:20.690
MARISHA: Rubber gloves.

4935
03:37:20.690 --> 03:37:21.790
SAM: Burn it!

4936
03:37:21.790 --> 03:37:23.250
LAURA: What does it say?

4937
03:37:23.250 --> 03:37:25.674
MATT: A YouTube unboxing of the letter.

4938
03:37:25.674 --> 03:37:27.962
SAM: All right, let's read it.

4939
03:37:27.962 --> 03:37:30.973
LIAM: The group sees a little flash.

4940
03:37:30.973 --> 03:37:32.491
TALIESIN: We have knife, by the way,

4941
03:37:32.491 --> 03:37:34.686
if we want to lock the front door, really lock it.

4942
03:37:34.686 --> 03:37:36.316
LAURA: Oh, good call.

4943
03:37:36.316 --> 03:37:37.843
SAM: Although it can come through the floor.

4944
03:37:37.843 --> 03:37:39.062
LAURA: That's true.

4945
03:37:39.062 --> 03:37:40.334
LIAM: So my back is to the group,

4946
03:37:40.334 --> 03:37:43.264
but they see a little (whooshes), and Frumpkin walks around

4947
03:37:43.264 --> 03:37:45.659
and just sits behind me, staring at the group.

4948
03:37:45.659 --> 03:37:47.284
MATT: Okay.

4949
03:37:47.284 --> 03:37:48.962
And I will read this out loud,

4950
03:37:48.962 --> 03:37:50.787
even though I'm just reading it in my head.

4951
03:37:50.787 --> 03:37:51.620
MATT: Okay.

4952
03:37:53.148 --> 03:37:57.964
"To the attention of Mrs. Lavore, Nott and Brave:

4953
03:37:59.327 --> 03:38:02.405
"I have received this letter on behalf of my elder mentors

03:38:04.986 --> 03:38:07.949
"This is a curious bit of fortune, it would seem.

"I have not spoken with my uncle for quite some time,

4957

"and while I am sad to hear of his passing,

03:38:13.085 --> 03:38:15.893
"I am also quite interested to hear about this inheritance

03:38:15.893 --> 03:38:19.560
"and the circumstances surrounding his death.

03:38:21.387 --> 03:38:26.337

"in the Empire."

4964
03:38:36.362 --> 03:38:38.533
MARISHA: I want to go there.
LAURA: It's pretty.

4965
03:38:38.533 --> 03:38:42.916
LIAM: "I travel often, so should I not be present,

4966
03:38:44.047 --> 03:38:47.303
"present this letter to any present servants

4967

03:38:57.344 --> 03:38:58.242
SAM: This is great!

4971
03:38:58.242 --> 03:39:00.853
We have an invitation to Rexxentrum.

4972
03:39:00.853 --> 03:39:02.600
LAURA: He didn't read it out loud.

4973
03:39:02.600 --> 03:39:04.004
LIAM: Yeah, that was just for the benefit

4974
03:39:04.004 --> 03:39:05.979
of you all and the audience.

4975
03:39:05.979 --> 03:39:07.471
SAM: What does it say?!

4976
03:39:07.471 --> 03:39:10.221
MARISHA: (laughs)

4977
03:39:11.612 --> 03:39:14.437
LIAM: Well, your ruse perhaps has worked.

4978
03:39:15.387 --> 03:39:16.220
Maybe.

4979
03:39:17.121 --> 03:39:17.954
MARISHA: Really?

4980
03:39:17.954 --> 03:39:19.542
LIAM: Maybe.

4981
03:39:19.542 --> 03:39:20.817
LAURA: What does it say?

4982
03:39:20.817 --> 03:39:23.868
LIAM: My old friend has said that you could come to

4983
03:39:25.718 --> 03:39:29.123
meet her at her home in Rexxentrum

4984
03:39:29.123 --> 03:39:32.257
to explain an inheritance?

4985
03:39:32.257 --> 03:39:33.927
LAURA: Oh, yeah.
SAM: It was very clever.

4986
03:39:33.927 --> 03:39:37.851
LAURA: Yeah, we told her she got a lot of money and stuff.

4987
03:39:37.851 --> 03:39:39.359
LIAM: We can't go there.

4988
03:39:39.359 --> 03:39:42.552
SAM: Yes, we can, if you have a letter inviting us,

4989
03:39:42.552 --> 03:39:44.277
will give us safe passage.

4990
03:39:44.277 --> 03:39:46.609
TRAVIS: Yes, but there's no inheritance.

4991
03:39:46.609 --> 03:39:48.310
LAURA: She doesn't know that.

4992
03:39:48.310 --> 03:39:49.573
SAM: We didn't specify what.

4993
03:39:49.573 --> 03:39:51.417
It could be a jade necklace.

4994
03:39:51.417 --> 03:39:52.575
LAURA: It could be-- I pull out that

4995
03:39:52.575 --> 03:39:53.991
hideous mask that I bought,

4996
03:39:53.991 --> 03:39:56.607
it could be this, you don't know.

4997
03:39:56.607 --> 03:39:58.078
TALIESIN: Oh, I forgot about that.

4998
03:39:58.078 --> 03:39:58.911
Oh god.

4999
03:39:58.911 --> 03:40:01.295
SAM: Her uncle's an asshole.

5000
03:40:01.295 --> 03:40:03.177
LAURA: I put the mask on.

5001
03:40:03.177 --> 03:40:05.513
SAM: It's all she got.

5002
03:40:05.513 --> 03:40:07.096
He had a good life.

5003
03:40:08.239 --> 03:40:10.244
LIAM: Do I know the Shimmer Ward from Rexxentrum?

5004
03:40:10.244 --> 03:40:11.162
MATT: You do, actually.

5005
03:40:11.162 --> 03:40:14.201
It's the central portion of the city.

5006
03:40:14.201 --> 03:40:19.173
It's deftly walled-in, surrounds Castle Ungebracht,

5007
03:40:19.173 --> 03:40:20.060
which is where--

5008
03:40:20.060 --> 03:40:20.983
LIAM: Say that one more time.

5009
03:40:20.983 --> 03:40:22.829
MATT: Actually, let me find the map for you.

5010
03:40:22.829 --> 03:40:25.746
LIAM: Ungebracht?
MATT: You would have this.

5011
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:29.552
Castle, yeah, Ungebroch.

5012
03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:33.018
I'm messing up the pronunciation.

5013
03:40:33.018 --> 03:40:35.322
You've been to Rexxentrum, so you can have this.

5014
03:40:35.322 --> 03:40:36.858
LIAM: Okay.

5015
03:40:36.858 --> 03:40:41.050
MATT: But the Shimmer Ward is central pentagon-like--

5016
03:40:41.050 --> 03:40:42.717
LIAM: Ungebroch.
MATT: Yep.

5017
03:40:45.095 --> 03:40:47.064
The Shimmer Ward is also where The Candles are.

5018
03:40:47.064 --> 03:40:50.625
The Candles are the towers of the Cerberus Assembly.

5019
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:52.858
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

5020
03:40:52.858 --> 03:40:55.986
LIAM: So that would mean that she is well-off,

5021
03:40:55.986 --> 03:40:58.904
doing well in the center of the city?

5022
03:40:58.904 --> 03:41:00.988
MATT: Based on the letter, yeah.

5023
03:41:00.988 --> 03:41:03.196
LIAM: And that is...

5024
03:41:04.962 --> 03:41:07.061
nobility, government...

5025
03:41:09.432 --> 03:41:11.282
Assembly-- go ahead.
MATT: Actually...

5026
03:41:12.949 --> 03:41:15.612
You would know this.

5027
03:41:15.612 --> 03:41:17.599
The address that's given there

5028
03:41:17.599 --> 03:41:20.760
is a manor that exists on the grounds

5029
03:41:20.760 --> 03:41:22.843
of Trent Ikithon's tower.

5030
03:41:24.276 --> 03:41:25.853
LIAM: So I recognize the address?

5031
03:41:25.853 --> 03:41:26.811
MATT: You do.

5032
03:41:28.401 --> 03:41:32.863
In fact, you're pretty sure all the handful of buildings

5033
03:41:32.863 --> 03:41:36.238
that exist on that plot are all owned by Trent.

5034
03:41:38.196 --> 03:41:40.888
MARISHA: He's like a cult leader.

5035
03:41:42.034 --> 03:41:43.367
SAM: Or a landlord.

5036
03:41:45.246 --> 03:41:46.193
(loud crack)

5037
03:41:46.193 --> 03:41:47.227
What the fuck?

5038
03:41:47.227 --> 03:41:49.063
TRAVIS: It was my ankle.

5039
03:41:49.063 --> 03:41:50.263
MARISHA: (laughs)

5040
03:41:50.263 --> 03:41:51.930
TALIESIN: Eh, you got two.

5041
03:41:54.329 --> 03:41:57.090
LIAM: My friends, just do me a favor

5042
03:41:57.090 --> 03:42:00.285
and maybe don't write any more letters

5043
03:42:00.285 --> 03:42:04.012
to my old school chums, okay?

5044
03:42:04.012 --> 03:42:05.345
SAM: Not a problem.

5045
03:42:06.736 --> 03:42:08.819
LIAM: You meant well, I know.

5046
03:42:10.396 --> 03:42:12.132
Thank you.
SAM: At the time, we--

5047
03:42:12.132 --> 03:42:15.720
<i>I</i> just wanted to get you connected

5048
03:42:15.720 --> 03:42:17.591
with people in your life.

5049
03:42:17.591 --> 03:42:19.668
LAURA: And she seemed so special.

5050
03:42:19.668 --> 03:42:21.168
LIAM: She was.

5051
03:42:24.483 --> 03:42:26.758
LAURA: Does it look like her handwriting?

5052
03:42:26.758 --> 03:42:27.839
LIAM: Yeah.

5053
03:42:27.839 --> 03:42:29.574
SAM: Does it smell like perfume?

5054
03:42:29.574 --> 03:42:30.407
LIAM: No.

5055
03:42:31.636 --> 03:42:36.636
SAM: Is there a "Do you like me, check this box"
sort of a thing?

5056
03:42:36.934 --> 03:42:39.684
LIAM: I don't think that box is here.

5057
03:42:42.322 --> 03:42:45.433
SAM: Well, that's an option,
though, if we get to Rexxentrum.

5058
03:42:45.433 --> 03:42:46.958
LIAM: So, Pumat.

5059
03:42:47.893 --> 03:42:51.359
I think we are ready to look into our friend.

5060
03:42:51.359 --> 03:42:52.612
TRAVIS: Scry guy.

5061
03:42:52.612 --> 03:42:53.445
MATT: "All righty.

5062
03:42:53.445 --> 03:42:55.519
"Let me just go ahead, I got that spell right here.

5063
03:42:55.519 --> 03:42:58.578
"We're looking at your friend...

5064
03:42:58.578 --> 03:42:59.961
"your friend Yasha, right?

5065
03:42:59.961 --> 03:43:02.892
"The one who was kinda pale face,

5066
03:43:02.892 --> 03:43:05.317
"kinda burly-looking badass, that one?"

5067
03:43:05.317 --> 03:43:07.814
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "All righty. Who wants to go first?"

5068
03:43:07.814 --> 03:43:09.697
TALIESIN: Not kidding about let's use that knife.

5069
03:43:09.697 --> 03:43:11.848
LAURA: I'll Scry on her first.

5070
03:43:11.848 --> 03:43:13.462
TRAVIS: Nott has it.
TALIESIN: Nott?

5071
03:43:13.462 --> 03:43:16.012
MATT: "If you're planning to Scry anybody else,
I don't know who they are."

5072
03:43:16.012 --> 03:43:17.217
SAM: Okay.

5073
03:43:17.217 --> 03:43:18.558
MATT: "It's the only person I know."

5074
03:43:18.558 --> 03:43:20.394
LAURA: Who else are we going to Scry on?

5075
03:43:20.394 --> 03:43:22.278
SAM: Well, let's see if Yasha works.

5076
03:43:22.278 --> 03:43:24.441
LAURA: The Inevitable End, you could Scry on them,

5077
03:43:24.441 --> 03:43:26.292
because you saw them.

5078
03:43:26.292 --> 03:43:27.490
MATT: "Oh, right.

5079
03:43:27.490 --> 03:43:31.101
"Ooh, yeah, all right. Should we do that first?"

5080
03:43:31.101 --> 03:43:33.004
LIAM: I think we should do Yasha to begin.

5081
03:43:33.004 --> 03:43:36.254
LAURA: Yasha to begin?
LIAM: Yes, to see what state she's in.

5082
03:43:37.770 --> 03:43:39.809
TRAVIS: We've done Yasha before.

5083
03:43:39.809 --> 03:43:42.106
Inevitable End could be insanely hard to look in on.

5084
03:43:42.106 --> 03:43:43.482
MATT: "Hey, whatever works for you guys,

5085
03:43:43.482 --> 03:43:44.574
"I'm just happy to host."

5086
03:43:44.574 --> 03:43:46.310
TALIESIN: Start with Yasha.

5087
03:43:46.310 --> 03:43:48.501
LAURA: Maybe Pumat should do it then.

5088
03:43:48.501 --> 03:43:51.323
I can-- that would be 5th-level?

5089
03:43:51.323 --> 03:43:52.406
SAM: Okay, sure.

5090
03:43:53.925 --> 03:43:55.043
MATT: "Whatever you prefer."

5091
03:43:55.043 --> 03:43:57.743
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw Guidance at Pumat as well.

5092
03:43:57.743 --> 03:43:58.968
LIAM: Caleb walks up to watch

5093
03:43:58.968 --> 03:44:01.089
and just plants his hand on Nott's shoulder

5094
03:44:01.089 --> 03:44:02.990
and gives it a gentle squeeze.

5095
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:05.401
LAURA: Pumat, when you're looking in on her.

5096
03:44:05.401 --> 03:44:07.101
MATT: "Yeah?"

5097
03:44:07.101 --> 03:44:09.184
LAURA: Look at her eyes, okay?

5098
03:44:11.669 --> 03:44:14.627
Just try to see how she's feeling.

5099
03:44:16.316 --> 03:44:18.916
And pay attention to her neck.

5100
03:44:18.916 --> 03:44:21.297
And if Obann touches her at all.

5101
03:44:21.297 --> 03:44:23.286
And if you see any lightning or any--
TRAVIS: Jester, I think

5102
03:44:23.286 --> 03:44:26.240
he's going to be quite observant.

5103
03:44:26.240 --> 03:44:27.434
LAURA: Okay.

5104
03:44:27.434 --> 03:44:29.571
MATT: "All that's been noted in the old noggin."

5105
03:44:29.571 --> 03:44:30.404
LAURA: Okay.

5106
03:44:31.697 --> 03:44:32.875
MATT: "All righty.

5107
03:44:32.875 --> 03:44:34.408
"Pumats, gather 'round.

5108
03:44:34.408 --> 03:44:35.603
(clears throat)

5109
03:44:36.895 --> 03:44:38.895
"Not to make you jealous.

5110
03:44:40.493 --> 03:44:41.879
"Well, they can't do magic anymore,

5111
03:44:41.879 --> 03:44:43.109
"they only get spells once,

5112
03:44:43.109 --> 03:44:44.723
"so they're just more my hands here.

5113
03:44:44.723 --> 03:44:47.489
"So I'm the spell caster, they're just my associates.

5114
03:44:47.489 --> 03:44:48.672
LAURA: Oh!

5115
03:44:48.672 --> 03:44:51.222
MATT: They're like, "Yeah, there are elements of missing it,

5116
03:44:51.222 --> 03:44:54.264
"I guess, but well, we're just happy to help,

5117
03:44:54.264 --> 03:44:56.231
"and he seems to do most of the pulling.

5118
03:44:56.231 --> 03:44:57.749
Everyone goes, "(laughs)"

5119
03:44:57.749 --> 03:44:58.907
"Anyway, continue."

5120
03:44:58.907 --> 03:45:01.127
"Yeah, of course, no worries, all right.

5121
03:45:01.127 --> 03:45:03.719
LIAM: We make a mean a cappella group.

5122
03:45:03.719 --> 03:45:04.994
LAURA: Oh, I bet.

5123
03:45:07.691 --> 03:45:09.069
MATT: Does not have good tune.

5124
03:45:09.069 --> 03:45:11.945
(laughter)

5125
03:45:11.945 --> 03:45:15.620
He concentrates on this large crystal sphere

5126
03:45:15.620 --> 03:45:19.525
that has this gold-leaf lattice that curls up around it.

5127
03:45:19.525 --> 03:45:22.709
It looks almost like an intricately carved

5128
03:45:22.709 --> 03:45:26.042
geometric nest that builds up around

5129
03:45:26.042 --> 03:45:28.488
2/3 of the actual sphere.

5130
03:45:28.488 --> 03:45:31.425
As he focuses on it, eyes closed, the eyes open once more,

5131
03:45:31.425 --> 03:45:33.087
and they're just clouded over.

5132
03:45:33.087 --> 03:45:36.278
You have a memory flash of when you first met Shakäste,

5133
03:45:36.278 --> 03:45:38.813
with that snow-blind look.

5134
03:45:38.813 --> 03:45:40.000
MARISHA: (whispers) Shakäste.

5135
03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:42.250
MATT: As he quietly focuses.
SAM: Don't.

5136
03:45:45.542 --> 03:45:49.125
MATT: Focus for a bit and starts talking aloud.

5137
03:45:51.398 --> 03:45:53.006
I need to make her save.

5138
03:45:58.874 --> 03:46:00.457
"All right, she's...

5139
03:46:03.979 --> 03:46:05.146
"She's walking.

5140
03:46:07.469 --> 03:46:09.555
"She's walking, she's got some companions around,

5141
03:46:09.555 --> 03:46:12.240
"they're all kind of cloaked right now.

5142
03:46:13.115 --> 03:46:15.032
"It's a bit of rainfall.

5143
03:46:15.958 --> 03:46:17.185
"Where are they?

5144
03:46:17.185 --> 03:46:19.602
"Little bit of mist down, there's...

5145
03:46:21.399 --> 03:46:22.334
"That's a big ci--

5146
03:46:22.334 --> 03:46:24.235
"Oh, they're walking up to Rexxentrum."

5147
03:46:24.235 --> 03:46:26.009
LAURA: (gasps)

5148
03:46:26.009 --> 03:46:28.439
They're in Rexxentrum?

5149
03:46:28.439 --> 03:46:31.356
MATT: "Trying to get a look at her eyes there.

5150
03:46:32.867 --> 03:46:34.200
"They're focused."

5151
03:46:35.774 --> 03:46:37.024
LAURA: Is her neck glowing?

5152
03:46:39.624 --> 03:46:40.724
(Matt rolls a die)

5153
03:46:40.724 --> 03:46:41.882
LAURA: Guidance.

5154
03:46:46.202 --> 03:46:47.589
MATT: "I can't see, unfortunately.

5155
03:46:47.589 --> 03:46:49.046
"Cloak's kind of blocking it all."

5156
03:46:49.046 --> 03:46:50.440
LAURA: Ah.

5157
03:46:50.440 --> 03:46:51.949
MATT: "Sorry, there's a big one with them."

5158
03:46:51.949 --> 03:46:54.273
LAURA: Does the big one look weak?

5159
03:46:54.273 --> 03:46:56.737
MATT: "It's a bi-- I don't know.

5160
03:46:56.737 --> 03:46:59.575
"I can't get a good look at it, I'm focused on Yasha.

5161
03:46:59.575 --> 03:47:01.488
"It's big, though."

5162
03:47:01.488 --> 03:47:02.321
LAURA: I wonder what would happen

5163
03:47:02.321 --> 03:47:04.035
if I Scryed at the same time on the Laughing Hand.

5164
03:47:04.035 --> 03:47:05.435
How weird would that be?

5165
03:47:05.435 --> 03:47:06.288
I'm going to do it.

5166
03:47:06.288 --> 03:47:07.488
MATT: "That'd be pretty weird."

5167
03:47:07.488 --> 03:47:10.463
TRAVIS: The Inevitable End or the Laughing Hand?
LAURA: Which one?

5168
03:47:10.463 --> 03:47:12.247
(laughter)

5169
03:47:12.247 --> 03:47:13.272
TALIESIN: Inevitable End.

5170
03:47:13.272 --> 03:47:16.146
LAURA: I'm going to Scry on the Inevitable End, I guess.

5171
03:47:16.146 --> 03:47:16.979
MATT: Okay.

5172
03:47:18.012 --> 03:47:22.427
TRAVIS: (like auctioneer) Laughing Hand, Inevitable End!

5173
03:47:22.427 --> 03:47:24.719
(auctioneering) Obann and the Laughing Hand man with a plan.

5174
03:47:24.719 --> 03:47:26.293
LIAM: (auctioneering) Sold to the [inaudible] in the last row!

5175
03:47:26.293 --> 03:47:27.643
TRAVIS: "To the hymen in the last row"?

5176
03:47:27.643 --> 03:47:29.304
LAURA: 10 minutes.

5177
03:47:29.304 --> 03:47:31.142
MATT: So yours will end by the time--

5178
03:47:31.142 --> 03:47:33.246
or his will end by the time yours starts.

5179
03:47:33.246 --> 03:47:37.778
He's like, "All right, they're approaching the outer gates.

5180
03:47:37.778 --> 03:47:39.611
"Oh, it's raining hard."

5181
03:47:40.518 --> 03:47:41.732
LAURA: Maybe I shouldn't do it then.

5182
03:47:41.732 --> 03:47:45.185
MATT: "There's a guard questioning them."

5183
03:47:45.185 --> 03:47:48.987
SAM: They're going to kill that guard.

5184
03:47:48.987 --> 03:47:50.787
MATT: "All right, now the guard lets them in."

5185
03:47:50.787 --> 03:47:54.288
LAURA: Because he manipulated the guard!
He can charm people.

5186
03:47:54.288 --> 03:47:56.868
MATT: "All right, now they're entering in the city.

5187
03:47:56.868 --> 03:47:59.031
"I haven't been to Rexxentrum in a while; it's real big."

5188
03:47:59.031 --> 03:48:00.826
TRAVIS: Do you see a woman with red hair

5189
03:48:00.826 --> 03:48:02.843
and dark elf-looking features?

5190
03:48:02.843 --> 03:48:05.271
LAURA: Do you see the Inevitable End?

5191
03:48:05.271 --> 03:48:08.271
MATT: "There's only so much radius around.

5192
03:48:11.616 --> 03:48:13.619
"She has a fourth trailing them.

5193
03:48:13.619 --> 03:48:14.583
"Oh god, it's her."

5194
03:48:14.583 --> 03:48:17.333
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs)

5195
03:48:18.333 --> 03:48:22.730
LAURA: Well, at least you know
she's not going to attack us here.

5196
03:48:22.730 --> 03:48:25.755
MATT: "I'm getting a little nervous. I'm going to--"

5197
03:48:25.755 --> 03:48:27.672
He blinks his eyes.

5198
03:48:28.658 --> 03:48:30.243
"Sorry, crept up on me there,

5199
03:48:30.243 --> 03:48:31.954
"it was getting a little uncomfortable,

5200
03:48:31.954 --> 03:48:34.521
"after what happened yesterday."
LAURA: Were they talking at all?

5201
03:48:34.521 --> 03:48:36.138
MATT: "No, they were pretty quiet.

5202
03:48:36.138 --> 03:48:38.894
"Just making their way up."
SAM: They're in Rexxentrum.

5203
03:48:38.894 --> 03:48:41.116
MARISHA: What are they going after in Rexxentrum?

5204
03:48:41.116 --> 03:48:45.033
SAM: Maybe they're reporting back to their bosses?

5205
03:48:45.886 --> 03:48:46.719
TRAVIS: At the--?

5206
03:48:47.911 --> 03:48:49.494
SAM: Soltryce Academy?

5207
03:48:51.117 --> 03:48:52.617
Cerberus Assembly?

5208
03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:56.205
MATT: "That's pretty much all of them."

5209
03:48:56.205 --> 03:48:58.739
TRAVIS: I mean, that was what we were looking for

5210
03:48:58.739 --> 03:49:01.941
in one try. It was excellent job describing it,

5211
03:49:01.941 --> 03:49:03.291
by the way, well done.

5212
03:49:03.291 --> 03:49:04.124
MATT: "Of course, yeah.

5213
03:49:04.124 --> 03:49:05.108
"Is it just like a small cult then,

5214
03:49:05.108 --> 03:49:06.780
"is it just the four of them?"

5215
03:49:06.780 --> 03:49:09.132
LAURA: They're really powerful.

5216
03:49:09.132 --> 03:49:10.592
Who knows, what if they're leading

5217
03:49:10.592 --> 03:49:12.734
a whole cult meeting right now?

5218
03:49:12.734 --> 03:49:14.132
TRAVIS: What if the Soltryce Academy

5219
03:49:14.132 --> 03:49:16.558
is the Angel of Irons?
LAURA: Maybe I should try

5220
03:49:16.558 --> 03:49:17.975
Scrying on Vence?

5221
03:49:18.882 --> 03:49:20.800
SAM: See if he's in Rexxentrum too?

5222
03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:23.315
MARISHA: Well, when we last spoke with Oremid Hass,

5223
03:49:23.315 --> 03:49:26.361
he said that Vence is in Rexxentrum,

5224
03:49:26.361 --> 03:49:29.286
on a mission for Ludininus.
LIAM: Ludinus.

5225
03:49:29.286 --> 03:49:31.375
MARISHA: Lununess.

5226
03:49:32.427 --> 03:49:33.927
TRAVIS: Bioluminescence.

5227
03:49:35.225 --> 03:49:36.363
Evanescence.
SAM: Yeah, do it.

5228
03:49:36.363 --> 03:49:37.449
LIAM: Like Ludacris.

5229
03:49:37.449 --> 03:49:41.737
LAURA: Okay, we should get ready to go to the Cobalt Soul

5230
03:49:41.737 --> 03:49:43.575
and bamf over to Rexxentrum.

5231
03:49:43.575 --> 03:49:45.145
SAM: We need to be at the Cobalt Soul to get there,

5232
03:49:45.145 --> 03:49:46.882
or can we do it from anywhere?

5233
03:49:46.882 --> 03:49:48.360
LAURA: Oh right, we bamf into the Cobalt Soul.

5234
03:49:48.360 --> 03:49:50.805
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Scry.

5235
03:49:50.805 --> 03:49:52.206
MARISHA: We can send a message.

5236
03:49:52.206 --> 03:49:54.967
LAURA: I'm going to Scry on Vence.

5237
03:49:54.967 --> 03:49:57.385
MATT: On Vence?
LAURA: Right?

5238
03:49:57.385 --> 03:49:59.746
SAM: No, on Ludinus, no, Vence?

5239
03:49:59.746 --> 03:50:02.534
LAURA: Vence, because Ludinus will block it.

5240
03:50:02.534 --> 03:50:05.102
SAM: Yeah, he's too powerful.
MARISHA: I would try it.

5241
03:50:05.102 --> 03:50:06.265
LAURA: Yeah?

5242
03:50:06.265 --> 03:50:09.298
Maybe and see if he's meeting up with them or something?

5243
03:50:09.298 --> 03:50:11.003
I should give it five minutes

5244
03:50:11.003 --> 03:50:13.974
and then see if maybe he's on the move, too.

5245
03:50:13.974 --> 03:50:17.984
SAM: Just out of curiosity, we know now that,

5246
03:50:17.984 --> 03:50:20.368
would Trent Ikithon be someone

5247
03:50:20.368 --> 03:50:23.548
that we want to Scry on?
LAURA: No, he would block it.

5248
03:50:23.548 --> 03:50:27.844
LIAM: I would give it maybe, Jester, maybe give it an hour

5249
03:50:27.844 --> 03:50:30.530
to let them get together.

5250
03:50:30.530 --> 03:50:32.707
SAM: Vess DeRogna?

5251
03:50:32.707 --> 03:50:34.209
LAURA: They're all going to be able to block it,

5252
03:50:34.209 --> 03:50:35.557
they all have this thing that Caleb has.

5253
03:50:35.557 --> 03:50:36.741
SAM: But Vence won't?

5254
03:50:36.741 --> 03:50:38.777
MARISHA: Caleb, do you remember the approximate time

5255
03:50:38.777 --> 03:50:41.693
that it would take to walk from the gates?

5256
03:50:41.693 --> 03:50:45.076
LIAM: Of course I do, it would be about--

5257
03:50:45.076 --> 03:50:48.775
MATT: At a casual pace, it would take...

5258
03:50:48.775 --> 03:50:49.610
To where?

5259
03:50:49.610 --> 03:50:51.575
To which part in the city?

5260
03:50:51.575 --> 03:50:54.529
LIAM: To wherever Vence, King Dwendal, wherever--

5261
03:50:54.529 --> 03:50:55.362
MATT: Gotcha.

5262
03:50:56.295 --> 03:51:00.805
That size, density, recently after a festival,

5263
03:51:00.805 --> 03:51:02.388
I'd say probably...

5264
03:51:04.763 --> 03:51:06.521
at most, an hour.

5265
03:51:06.521 --> 03:51:08.895
LAURA: So I should wait like 30 minutes and do it.

5266
03:51:08.895 --> 03:51:10.358
TALIESIN: We should go there now.

5267
03:51:10.358 --> 03:51:13.351
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was saying,
we're not trying to get there now?

5268
03:51:13.351 --> 03:51:14.342
LAURA: We should get there now.

5269
03:51:14.342 --> 03:51:16.500
MATT: Have you been preparing a Scry during this time?

5270
03:51:16.500 --> 03:51:19.068
LAURA: I was, but then when you said that it would be ended,

5271
03:51:19.068 --> 03:51:20.431
I was like, oh, never mind.

5272
03:51:20.431 --> 03:51:22.194
The fun of it was to be Scrying at the same time.

5273
03:51:22.194 --> 03:51:23.206
MATT: Right.

5274
03:51:23.206 --> 03:51:25.246
So you're not Scrying on Vence?

5275
03:51:25.246 --> 03:51:26.245
LAURA: No.
LIAM: Not this second,

5276
03:51:26.245 --> 03:51:30.218
because they're not, our chances of landing on them

5277
03:51:30.218 --> 03:51:33.648
with your eyes at the right moment are slim,

5278
03:51:33.648 --> 03:51:34.499
but if we do it right now,

5279
03:51:34.499 --> 03:51:36.310
they've just walked into the city.

5280
03:51:36.310 --> 03:51:37.527
He's not waiting for them there,

5281
03:51:37.527 --> 03:51:39.393
so maybe give them some time to wind their way in

5282
03:51:39.393 --> 03:51:40.960
and get where they're going?

5283
03:51:40.960 --> 03:51:42.811
LAURA: Maybe we should get over to--

5284
03:51:42.811 --> 03:51:44.873
TRAVIS: Cobalt Soul?
LAURA: Yeah, we should bamf there

5285
03:51:44.873 --> 03:51:46.008
and then I'll Scry.

5286
03:51:46.008 --> 03:51:48.458
LIAM: Pass the time on the way to the Soul,

5287
03:51:48.458 --> 03:51:50.892
and then we could get there, and you can Scry.

5288
03:51:50.892 --> 03:51:51.725
Oh god.

5289
03:51:53.053 --> 03:51:54.281
LAURA: What?

5290
03:51:54.281 --> 03:51:55.798
SAM: Can't Scry from the Soul?

5291
03:51:55.798 --> 03:51:59.932
LIAM: No, I'm just nervous about going home.

5292
03:51:59.932 --> 03:52:00.765
SAM: Oh.

5293
03:52:02.275 --> 03:52:03.256
TRAVIS: Sure.

5294
03:52:03.256 --> 03:52:04.510
I think we know where they are, though,

5295
03:52:04.510 --> 03:52:06.208
we should take advantage of this, yes?

5296
03:52:06.208 --> 03:52:07.967
LIAM: I trust you guys.

5297
03:52:07.967 --> 03:52:09.647
MARISHA: Why don't we head back?

5298
03:52:09.647 --> 03:52:11.458
TALIESIN: This is the first time we've been ahead of them.

5299
03:52:11.458 --> 03:52:12.291
LAURA: Running in again.

5300
03:52:12.291 --> 03:52:13.462
MARISHA: That's what I was about to say.

5301
03:52:13.462 --> 03:52:16.359
Before we do this, why don't we head back to the Soul,

5302
03:52:16.359 --> 03:52:17.832
I can check in with Zeenoth,

5303
03:52:17.832 --> 03:52:19.808
then we can check in with Kathedoc

5304
03:52:19.808 --> 03:52:21.954
over at the Rexxentrum Ranch,

5305
03:52:21.954 --> 03:52:23.362
and maybe get a little bit of backup.

5306
03:52:23.362 --> 03:52:25.562
LAURA: Let Dairon know we're going to go there.

5307
03:52:25.562 --> 03:52:27.150
She can help. They can help.

5308
03:52:27.150 --> 03:52:30.598
SAM: Maybe change our clothes
out of these Xhorhasian clothes?

5309
03:52:30.598 --> 03:52:31.657
LAURA: We've already changed.

5310
03:52:31.657 --> 03:52:32.745
SAM: Oh, great.
MATT: You do also know

5311
03:52:32.745 --> 03:52:34.453
that you can use the teleportation circles

5312
03:52:34.453 --> 03:52:38.482
at the Cobalt Soul, and not cost a spell slot.

5313
03:52:38.482 --> 03:52:39.315
LAURA: Ooh!

5314
03:52:40.264 --> 03:52:41.977
Let's do that.

5315
03:52:41.977 --> 03:52:43.870
TALIESIN: We can let everybody who needs to know

5316
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:46.770
where we're going, because we have a lot of people now.

5317
03:52:46.770 --> 03:52:48.878
We got to let everybody know what's about to happen.

5318
03:52:48.878 --> 03:52:50.041
MARISHA: We're trusting in allies.

5319
03:52:50.041 --> 03:52:52.874
LAURA: Yeah, we should let Oremid know.

5320
03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:55.379
SAM: Great, let's go.
TALIESIN: The Tal'Dorei Council.

5321
03:52:55.379 --> 03:52:57.842
TRAVIS: Pumat, thank you, it's been a hell of a two days.

5322
03:52:57.842 --> 03:52:59.696
I'm afraid we're going to take our leave now.

5323
03:52:59.696 --> 03:53:00.779
MATT: "Oh, all right, no worries.

5324
03:53:00.779 --> 03:53:02.640
"All right, guys, close up the shop."

5325
03:53:02.640 --> 03:53:04.868
He reaches over and grabs a bag from behind the counter.

5326
03:53:04.868 --> 03:53:07.278
MARISHA: Where you going?
LAURA: Are you coming with us?

5327
03:53:07.278 --> 03:53:08.582
MATT: "Well, I figure you probably needed some help

5328
03:53:08.582 --> 03:53:09.635
"if you're doing stuff real bad."

5329
03:53:09.635 --> 03:53:11.444
TRAVIS: (excited laughing)

5330
03:53:11.444 --> 03:53:15.226
LAURA: Yes!
MARISHA: Road trip with Pumat!

5331
03:53:15.226 --> 03:53:17.644
TRAVIS: Absolutely.
MATT: "Should I not?"

5332
03:53:17.644 --> 03:53:21.004
LAURA: Pumat, oh my gosh, come with us, oh my gosh!

5333
03:53:21.004 --> 03:53:23.211
LIAM: Are you coming, or are all of you?

5334
03:53:23.211 --> 03:53:26.571
MATT: "No, they're not much help in any of this (laughs).

5335
03:53:26.571 --> 03:53:27.866
"I need them to continue to run the shop,

5336
03:53:27.866 --> 03:53:28.862
"I still got to make my money.

5337
03:53:28.862 --> 03:53:30.945
"Yeah, they know what to do, besides."

5338
03:53:32.581 --> 03:53:37.415
LIAM: Respectfully, that is very generous of you.

5339
03:53:37.415 --> 03:53:39.025
MATT: "Well, this is some real dangerous dung

5340
03:53:39.025 --> 03:53:40.630
"you've stepped in, right?

5341
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:41.518
"This is going to affect

5342
03:53:41.518 --> 03:53:42.641
"all this bit."
TRAVIS: Sign this waiver

5343
03:53:42.641 --> 03:53:45.434
right here, if you would.
MARISHA: Yeah, we're not liable.

5344
03:53:45.434 --> 03:53:46.927
Anything.

5345
03:53:46.927 --> 03:53:48.186
MATT: "Not a fan of signing paperwork

5346
03:53:48.186 --> 03:53:51.180
"I haven't had a chance to thoroughly read, respectfully."

5347
03:53:51.180 --> 03:53:53.263
LAURA: Understandably.
LIAM: Smart.

5348
03:53:54.273 --> 03:53:56.160
LAURA: Yeah, let's go!

5349
03:53:56.160 --> 03:53:59.684
MATT: "All right. (sighs)"

5350
03:53:59.684 --> 03:54:00.519
TALIESIN: This is big.

5351
03:54:00.519 --> 03:54:04.059
LAURA: Oh man, Pumat's coming with us, oh my god!

5352
03:54:04.059 --> 03:54:06.062
SAM: Hey, before we leave his place,

5353
03:54:06.062 --> 03:54:09.286
was I able to retrieve my little bola thing,

5354
03:54:09.286 --> 03:54:12.353
or was it destroyed on impact?

5355
03:54:13.898 --> 03:54:14.856
MATT: No, you can go ahead and retrieve it.

5356
03:54:14.856 --> 03:54:16.606
SAM: Okay, great.
MATT: Yeah.

5357
03:54:19.525 --> 03:54:20.581
SAM: There's one that you said

5358
03:54:20.581 --> 03:54:23.102
that was kind of fucked up to begin with.

5359
03:54:23.102 --> 03:54:24.012
MATT: Was that the one you fired?

5360
03:54:24.012 --> 03:54:25.899
SAM: I don't know.

5361
03:54:25.899 --> 03:54:30.619
You said that one is probably less reliable than the other.

5362
03:54:30.619 --> 03:54:33.106
MATT: Yeah, no, the one that you fired

5363
03:54:33.106 --> 03:54:35.559
was the less viable one, and that one is busted.

5364
03:54:35.559 --> 03:54:37.498
SAM: So I have one left.
MATT: So you have one left.

5365
03:54:37.498 --> 03:54:39.787
But you're sure that one is probably pretty functional.

5366
03:54:39.787 --> 03:54:40.620
SAM: Great.

5367
03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:41.870
MATT: All right.

5368
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:44.125
So you guys make your way--

5369
03:54:44.125 --> 03:54:46.668
LAURA: Should I send a message to Oremid Hass on the way

5370
03:54:46.668 --> 03:54:49.418
and let him know what's going on?

5371
03:54:50.995 --> 03:54:53.522
LIAM: I have no input on that, because I wasn't there.

5372
03:54:53.522 --> 03:54:55.416
LAURA: I mean, he should know, right?

5373
03:54:55.416 --> 03:54:56.741
He was concerned.

5374
03:54:56.741 --> 03:54:59.003
We should let Allura know, too.

5375
03:54:59.003 --> 03:55:00.032
They're in Rexxentrum.

5376
03:55:00.032 --> 03:55:02.653
SAM: And the Tal'Dorei Council, yes.

5377
03:55:02.653 --> 03:55:04.377
MARISHA: We have the seal from the Cerberus Assembly.

5378
03:55:04.377 --> 03:55:06.669
TALIESIN: We'll also see how much
the Cobalt Soul can do for us.

5379
03:55:06.669 --> 03:55:08.333
They can probably take care of spreading the word.

5380
03:55:08.333 --> 03:55:10.234
LAURA: Good idea, so I don't use up all my spells,

5381
03:55:10.234 --> 03:55:12.568
okay, because we might be fighting or something.

5382
03:55:12.568 --> 03:55:13.401
Oh man.

5383
03:55:17.995 --> 03:55:18.828
Okay, let's go.

5384
03:55:18.828 --> 03:55:21.373
TRAVIS: Let's do it.
MARISHA: To the Soul!

5385
03:55:21.373 --> 03:55:25.600
MATT: You guys make your way to the Valley Archive.

5386
03:55:25.600 --> 03:55:30.533
No issue entering with the recently anointed expositor.

5387
03:55:31.962 --> 03:55:35.304
The chambers are yours, what would you like to do?

5388
03:55:35.304 --> 03:55:36.582
MARISHA: I'll look for Zeenoth.

5389
03:55:36.582 --> 03:55:38.248
MATT: Mmkay. You do, takes a moment,

5390
03:55:38.248 --> 03:55:39.870
but you find him.
MARISHA: And Dairon?

5391
03:55:39.870 --> 03:55:43.787
MATT: Dairon is not present, but Zeenoth is around.

5392
03:55:45.488 --> 03:55:49.462
He's looking pretty healed at this point.

5393
03:55:49.462 --> 03:55:51.322
It's just a little bit of a slight limp.

5394
03:55:51.322 --> 03:55:55.245
He goes, "Hello, can I help you?"

5395
03:55:55.245 --> 03:55:58.310
MARISHA: Zeenoth, how you doing? I pat him.

5396
03:55:58.310 --> 03:55:59.310
MATT: All right, all right.

5397
03:56:00.209 --> 03:56:02.530
"Pleasure to see you as well, Expositor.

5398
03:56:02.530 --> 03:56:03.363
"And the rest of you?"

5399
03:56:03.363 --> 03:56:04.701
LIAM: You're looking fit.

5400
03:56:04.701 --> 03:56:08.081
MATT: "Pumat, I wasn't expecting to see you."

5401
03:56:08.081 --> 03:56:11.669
(as Pumat) "Yeah, I just needed a vacation to just go relax

5402
03:56:11.669 --> 03:56:14.401
"and have some totally not dangerous times

5403
03:56:14.401 --> 03:56:18.026
"with my favorite customers.

5404
03:56:18.968 --> 03:56:20.933
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's a grin.

5405
03:56:20.933 --> 03:56:21.766
MATT: (as Zeenoth) "Right."

5406
03:56:23.538 --> 03:56:25.687
MARISHA: Kind of what he's talking
about is what I'm here for.

5407
03:56:25.687 --> 03:56:26.955
We got to get to Rexxentrum.

5408
03:56:26.955 --> 03:56:29.424
MATT: "Oh, we'll get you, right this way."

5409
03:56:29.424 --> 03:56:32.507
MARISHA: Obann and the other four are there,

5410
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:36.019
and they're on the move.

5411
03:56:36.019 --> 03:56:37.008
MATT: "That's not good."

5412
03:56:37.008 --> 03:56:37.841
MARISHA: Yeah.

5413
03:56:39.825 --> 03:56:42.701
MATT: "Well, let's get you there right away then."

5414
03:56:42.701 --> 03:56:45.826
LAURA: Can you get a message to Oremid Hass

5415
03:56:45.826 --> 03:56:49.078
and tell him what we just told you?

5416
03:56:49.078 --> 03:56:52.181
MATT: "Certainly, yes, I can have that arranged, yes."

5417
03:56:52.181 --> 03:56:53.139
LAURA: It's super important.

5418
03:56:53.139 --> 03:56:56.224
TALIESIN: Oh, and maybe Lady Allura if possible as well.

5419
03:56:56.224 --> 03:56:58.460
LAURA: I should send a message to her directly.

5420
03:56:58.460 --> 03:56:59.549
I'll do that.

5421
03:56:59.549 --> 03:57:02.169
MARISHA: I know that the Cobalt Soul's often isolated

5422
03:57:02.169 --> 03:57:05.619
from these other type of institutions,

5423
03:57:05.619 --> 03:57:07.281
but I think, in this moment,

5424
03:57:07.281 --> 03:57:10.060
we need to cooperate with the Cerberus Assembly

5425
03:57:10.060 --> 03:57:12.018
to try and handle this.

5426
03:57:12.018 --> 03:57:14.451
MATT: "Wouldn't be the first time.

5427
03:57:14.451 --> 03:57:17.521
"All right, I'll prepare the folks here,

5428
03:57:17.521 --> 03:57:18.645
"and if you're heading to Rexxentrum,

5429
03:57:18.645 --> 03:57:21.168
"just go ahead and let them know the same."

5430
03:57:21.168 --> 03:57:22.694
MARISHA: Will you let Kathedoc know I'm coming?

5431
03:57:22.694 --> 03:57:24.628
I kind of pissed him off last time.

5432
03:57:24.628 --> 03:57:25.461
MATT: "That can be done.

5433
03:57:25.461 --> 03:57:28.580
"And look for Archivist Kathedoc,

5434
03:57:28.580 --> 03:57:32.497
"they would be the ones who handles the arrival."

5435
03:57:34.355 --> 03:57:35.326
MARISHA: Same guy.

5436
03:57:35.326 --> 03:57:37.383
Thinking was same dude.

5437
03:57:37.383 --> 03:57:38.800
Kathedoc?
MATT: "Right.

5438
03:57:39.645 --> 03:57:42.921
"Have them, if possible, introduce you to

5439
03:57:42.921 --> 03:57:47.171
"the High, what is it?

5440
03:57:50.704 --> 03:57:53.489
"The High Curator, Yudala Fon,"

5441
03:57:53.489 --> 03:57:54.990
and you've never met Yudala, but you've heard of it.

5442
03:57:54.990 --> 03:57:56.423
Yudala Fon is the--
MARISHA: Yudala?

5443
03:57:56.423 --> 03:57:58.889
MATT: Yudala Fon is the--
LIAM: Yudala Fon.

5444
03:57:58.889 --> 03:58:03.889
MATT: Correct. Is the High, High Curator of the Cobalt Soul.

5445
03:58:04.650 --> 03:58:06.572
Outside of the one that's in Vasselheim,

5446
03:58:06.572 --> 03:58:08.793
which is the only equal level,

5447
03:58:08.793 --> 03:58:11.061
they are both the dual-leadership

5448
03:58:11.061 --> 03:58:15.442
over the entire structure of the Cobalt Soul.

5449
03:58:15.442 --> 03:58:17.826
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: So like Yeezus.

5450
03:58:17.826 --> 03:58:18.967
MATT: Sure.

5451
03:58:18.967 --> 03:58:19.800
LIAM: Got it.

5452
03:58:21.054 --> 03:58:21.887
Yeezus.

5453
03:58:21.887 --> 03:58:24.711
MATT: He guides you down to the subterranean

5454
03:58:24.711 --> 03:58:26.634
teleportation nexus chamber,

5455
03:58:26.634 --> 03:58:29.372
and the same Rexxentrum entryway

5456
03:58:29.372 --> 03:58:34.372
that you guys had previously brought your horses through,

5457
03:58:34.582 --> 03:58:37.333
lies available and at your disposal.

5458
03:58:37.333 --> 03:58:38.429
(laughs)

5459
03:58:38.429 --> 03:58:41.491
LIAM: Looks so beautiful without horse plops everywhere.

5460
03:58:41.491 --> 03:58:42.749
MATT: "Yes,

5461
03:58:42.749 --> 03:58:45.824
"took quite a bit to get that stain out of the marble,

5462
03:58:45.824 --> 03:58:48.148
"but that's all right.

5463
03:58:48.148 --> 03:58:48.981
"Good luck.

5464
03:58:50.042 --> 03:58:51.344
"Be safe."

5465
03:58:51.344 --> 03:58:52.344
MARISHA: Thank you.

5466
03:58:54.255 --> 03:58:55.953
MATT: Turns around.

5467
03:58:55.953 --> 03:58:56.870
MARISHA: Let's go!

5468
03:58:58.173 --> 03:58:59.816
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5469
03:58:59.816 --> 03:59:01.538
LIAM: I take a step forward, plant one hand

5470
03:59:01.538 --> 03:59:03.506
on Beauregard's shoulder, and use the other hand

5471
03:59:03.506 --> 03:59:06.105
to start to weave the air around me,

5472
03:59:06.105 --> 03:59:09.831
and (whooshes) here we go.

5473
03:59:09.831 --> 03:59:11.933
MATT: As you guys step into the circle

5474
03:59:11.933 --> 03:59:14.713
that sits at the end of that hallway,

5475
03:59:14.713 --> 03:59:17.563
you all (whooshes) vanish through,

5476
03:59:17.563 --> 03:59:19.730
arriving on the other end.

5477
03:59:20.832 --> 03:59:23.368
SAM: It's getting real.

5478
03:59:23.368 --> 03:59:24.996
MATT: You step through the other familiar chamber

5479
03:59:24.996 --> 03:59:26.943
on the opposite end.

5480
03:59:26.943 --> 03:59:30.981
The interior of the nexus, the teleportation nexus,

5481
03:59:30.981 --> 03:59:33.052
all the doors closed around you still,

5482
03:59:33.052 --> 03:59:36.329
and that staircase that leads into that upper floor.

5483
03:59:36.329 --> 03:59:38.786
There is, within the room, a single armed warrior

5484
03:59:38.786 --> 03:59:41.086
of the Cobalt Soul, adorned in full armor,

5485
03:59:41.086 --> 03:59:45.081
who notices your arrival, spins, and goes, "Kryn!"

5486
03:59:45.081 --> 03:59:47.521
MARISHA: Oh, no.

5487
03:59:47.521 --> 03:59:51.358
I'm Expositor Beauregard, here from Zadash.

5488
03:59:51.358 --> 03:59:54.092
MATT: "That's right, my apologies."

5489
03:59:54.092 --> 03:59:55.407
You hear some footfalls coming down,

5490
03:59:55.407 --> 03:59:56.769
a couple other soldiers arrive,

5491
03:59:56.769 --> 04:00:00.472
and the familiar half-orc person,

5492
04:00:00.472 --> 04:00:04.462
Archivist Kathedoc comes, the white hair, goes,

5493
04:00:04.462 --> 04:00:05.295
"Oh, you've arrived.

5494
04:00:05.295 --> 04:00:06.336
"Is this--

5495
04:00:07.853 --> 04:00:09.778
are you here to help?"

5496
04:00:09.778 --> 04:00:11.566
MARISHA: Yeah, what's happened?

5497
04:00:11.566 --> 04:00:13.599
Has something already happened?

5498
04:00:13.599 --> 04:00:15.874
MATT: "It appears that some form of...

5499
04:00:17.120 --> 04:00:20.124
"Kryn assaulted certain parts of the city

5500
04:00:20.124 --> 04:00:22.220
"in the past 10 minutes."

5501
04:00:22.220 --> 04:00:23.053
MARISHA: What?

5502
04:00:23.053 --> 04:00:24.803
SAM: Shit, it's happening now.

5503
04:00:24.803 --> 04:00:27.076
TALIESIN: It's not what you think it is.

5504
04:00:27.076 --> 04:00:28.436
MARISHA: Or it is.

5505
04:00:28.436 --> 04:00:29.547
LAURA: Or maybe it is.

5506
04:00:29.547 --> 04:00:30.380
SAM: Where?

5507
04:00:30.380 --> 04:00:32.144
LIAM: How large are the forces?

5508
04:00:32.144 --> 04:00:34.178
MATT: "We're still ascertaining the amount,

5509
04:00:34.178 --> 04:00:36.126
"it's only been recently happening.

5510
04:00:36.126 --> 04:00:38.207
"We just found out ourselves and began to arm up."

5511
04:00:38.207 --> 04:00:41.373
MARISHA: Are they assassins, or does it sound like...?

5512
04:00:41.373 --> 04:00:45.412
MATT: "Apparently they are riding on purple wormback."

5513
04:00:45.412 --> 04:00:46.430
SAM: That's Kryn.

5514
04:00:46.430 --> 04:00:48.768
Where is this happening?

5515
04:00:48.768 --> 04:00:49.851
MATT: "Come."
TRAVIS: Take us.

5516
04:00:51.248 --> 04:00:53.165
MATT: Comes to the top there.

5517
04:00:55.666 --> 04:00:58.133
Leads you to the top area and the exterior.

5518
04:00:58.133 --> 04:01:00.967
First off, seeing the interior of this library,

5519
04:01:00.967 --> 04:01:03.516
you guys were impressed by the Valley Archive,

5520
04:01:03.516 --> 04:01:05.330
but here, within the Rexxentrum Archive

5521
04:01:05.330 --> 04:01:07.904
of the Cobalt Soul, this library is easily

5522
04:01:07.904 --> 04:01:11.265
50% larger or more, and there are multiple floors,

5523
04:01:11.265 --> 04:01:13.596
and you can see from the interior,

5524
04:01:13.596 --> 04:01:17.951
probably four full 15-foot high tiers

5525
04:01:17.951 --> 04:01:20.948
of libraries that just expand from level to level,

5526
04:01:20.948 --> 04:01:23.379
with all sorts of little pocket chambers and walkways

5527
04:01:23.379 --> 04:01:25.354
that connect between them.

5528
04:01:25.354 --> 04:01:27.826
On the inside, there are people that were doing research,

5529
04:01:27.826 --> 04:01:29.051
but are starting to put books away,

5530
04:01:29.051 --> 04:01:31.512
and usher from the word that's spreading

5531
04:01:31.512 --> 04:01:36.179
of this immediate chaos that's breaking within the town.

5532
04:01:37.091 --> 04:01:38.739
MARISHA: You're drooling.

5533
04:01:38.739 --> 04:01:41.714
Just a little-- like right-- you got-- yeah.

5534
04:01:42.898 --> 04:01:44.350
LIAM: I don't know if I can do this.

5535
04:01:44.350 --> 04:01:47.098
MATT: Kathedoc leads you outside into the middle

5536
04:01:47.098 --> 04:01:49.076
of what is the Tangles,

5537
04:01:49.076 --> 04:01:51.475
which is one of the regions of Rexxentrum.

5538
04:01:51.475 --> 04:01:54.226
You immediately can see the beautiful cerulean building

5539
04:01:54.226 --> 04:01:56.847
you stepped out of, marked be four short multi-level

5540
04:01:56.847 --> 04:01:58.986
domed towers of polished blue stone.

5541
04:01:58.986 --> 04:02:00.680
You saw them from the inside, and the elements

5542
04:02:00.680 --> 04:02:02.924
of some sun that was poking through from the outside.

5543
04:02:02.924 --> 04:02:05.577
It's this beautiful kind of--

5544
04:02:05.577 --> 04:02:07.991
it would look almost like a futuristic Sim City building

5545
04:02:07.991 --> 04:02:11.849
if it wasn't just a polished piece of stone and glass.

5546
04:02:13.183 --> 04:02:17.452
You step out into the Court of Colors,

5547
04:02:17.452 --> 04:02:20.703
which is this region of the Tangles.

5548
04:02:20.703 --> 04:02:23.004
It's on the western edge of the region.

5549
04:02:23.004 --> 04:02:25.661
You can see harvest-themed banners around you,

5550
04:02:25.661 --> 04:02:28.995
the decor line of bright red, brown,

5551
04:02:28.995 --> 04:02:31.906
cobblestone streets that curve into crowded cross-streets

5552
04:02:31.906 --> 04:02:34.487
lined with carts and social spots.

5553
04:02:34.487 --> 04:02:37.764
Some of the local businesses appear to be closing quickly.

5554
04:02:37.764 --> 04:02:39.654
Others are already deserting it

5555
04:02:39.654 --> 04:02:43.598
and starting to go into their respective homes.

5556
04:02:43.598 --> 04:02:45.777
You can see crownsguards starting to usher folks around,

5557
04:02:45.777 --> 04:02:48.935
but you don't see any signs of any attacks.

5558
04:02:48.935 --> 04:02:50.470
LAURA: Can we get high?

5559
04:02:50.470 --> 04:02:51.802
MATT: Maybe.

5560
04:02:51.802 --> 04:02:53.010
MARISHA: Hey.

5561
04:02:54.126 --> 04:02:55.664
You got this.

5562
04:02:55.664 --> 04:02:57.262
You can do this.

5563
04:02:59.406 --> 04:03:00.564
We need you.

5564
04:03:00.564 --> 04:03:01.708
We need you to do this.

5565
04:03:01.708 --> 04:03:03.216
LIAM: Yeah, good.

5566
04:03:04.142 --> 04:03:05.241
Good.

5567
04:03:05.241 --> 04:03:06.587
TRAVIS: Can you take us to a point of elevation,

5568
04:03:06.587 --> 04:03:09.704
somewhere we can see more clearly across the city?

5569
04:03:11.063 --> 04:03:13.183
MATT: "Perhaps. Come up this way."

5570
04:03:13.183 --> 04:03:16.949
He leads you guys up another spiral staircase

5571
04:03:16.949 --> 04:03:19.338
that goes to a little parapet that overlooks

5572
04:03:19.338 --> 04:03:22.233
from the second to tallest tower.

5573
04:03:22.233 --> 04:03:25.970
You can see the expanse of Rexxentrum.

5574
04:03:25.970 --> 04:03:27.359
For those of you who have never visited,

5575
04:03:27.359 --> 04:03:30.715
which is pretty much all of you but Caleb, I believe.

5576
04:03:32.232 --> 04:03:35.190
It is a sprawling,

5577
04:03:35.190 --> 04:03:39.048
sprawling metropolis of multitudes of towers

5578
04:03:39.048 --> 04:03:42.105
and chimneys of all heights and sizes,

5579
04:03:42.105 --> 04:03:44.015
many of which seem to have

5580
04:03:44.015 --> 04:03:46.837
this ominous lean-in type feel

5581
04:03:46.837 --> 04:03:49.951
that crowd around the immediate space you're in,

5582
04:03:49.951 --> 04:03:51.517
and just continue on in all directions.

5583
04:03:51.517 --> 04:03:52.878
You can see the roll of the hills

5584
04:03:52.878 --> 04:03:54.480
that the city was built upon.

5585
04:03:54.480 --> 04:03:56.104
You can see the rising wall

5586
04:03:56.104 --> 04:03:57.495
that surrounds the Shimmer Ward.

5587
04:03:57.495 --> 04:04:00.368
You can see little plumes of smoke,

5588
04:04:00.368 --> 04:04:02.233
and you can see people in the streets,

5589
04:04:02.233 --> 04:04:05.568
some still going about their business unaware.

5590
04:04:05.568 --> 04:04:07.019
You can make a perception check, if you'd like.

5591
04:04:07.019 --> 04:04:07.852
Whoever's up top.

5592
04:04:07.852 --> 04:04:09.769
Two people can make it.
TRAVIS: Chimney stacks or like--?

5593
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:13.432
Yeah, you can do it.

5594
04:04:13.432 --> 04:04:15.054
Advantage.

5595
04:04:15.054 --> 04:04:16.034
MATT: So you're aiding--

5596
04:04:16.034 --> 04:04:19.014
LAURA: Guidance.
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

5597
04:04:19.014 --> 04:04:20.181
Where's my d4?

5598
04:04:24.101 --> 04:04:25.059
SAM: Oh, wow.

5599
04:04:25.059 --> 04:04:27.195
TALIESIN: How is that even possible?
TRAVIS: What is it?

5600
04:04:27.195 --> 04:04:28.786
Double ones?
TALIESIN: Double ones.

5601
04:04:28.786 --> 04:04:30.446
SAM: Doub-ones.
TRAVIS: From you?

5602
04:04:30.446 --> 04:04:33.446
MATT: You guys, glancing around up here--

5603
04:04:34.713 --> 04:04:36.531
TALIESIN: 13, technically, but double ones--

5604
04:04:36.531 --> 04:04:38.198
LAURA: No, but it's ones.

5605
04:04:40.214 --> 04:04:42.153
TALIESIN: I'm distracted, apparently.
MATT: So you guys looking around,

5606
04:04:42.153 --> 04:04:42.989
because partially,

5607
04:04:42.989 --> 04:04:44.849
you've never seen something this large in your life.

5608
04:04:44.849 --> 04:04:48.565
You grew up in a small grove in a dark forest.

5609
04:04:48.565 --> 04:04:51.559
This is awe-inspiring and terrifying in equal parts,

5610
04:04:51.559 --> 04:04:54.724
and so much bigger than you want.

5611
04:04:54.724 --> 04:04:59.176
LAURA: You wouldn't even know what a
plume of smoke would be, like where--

5612
04:04:59.176 --> 04:05:02.618
MATT: This is the antithesis of how you were raised,

5613
04:05:02.618 --> 04:05:06.033
and you find yourself immediately lost

5614
04:05:06.033 --> 04:05:08.707
and a little strangely claustrophobic

5615
04:05:08.707 --> 04:05:12.038
in how big it is and how lost you feel in the center of it.

5616
04:05:12.038 --> 04:05:14.029
All of you looking around and trying to take it in,

5617
04:05:14.029 --> 04:05:16.183
you have no idea, nor do you see any signs

5618
04:05:16.183 --> 04:05:19.070
in the immediate vicinity of any conflict.

5619
04:05:19.070 --> 04:05:21.239
It's not like everyone's rushing for battle,

5620
04:05:21.239 --> 04:05:22.790
they're just-- word's starting to spread,

5621
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:24.919
and people are starting to hunker down

5622
04:05:24.919 --> 04:05:29.257
and be defensive, and that's where it stands.

5623
04:05:29.257 --> 04:05:31.505
SAM: Who's leading us through this, Kathedoc still?

5624
04:05:31.505 --> 04:05:34.516
MATT: Kathedoc, who's just like,

5625
04:05:34.516 --> 04:05:36.381
"This is all the word we've got."
LAURA: Do you see anything?

5626
04:05:36.381 --> 04:05:40.353
MATT: "Nothing yet, no, we're just trying to be careful

5627
04:05:40.353 --> 04:05:41.873
"and be ready in case anything happens."

5628
04:05:41.873 --> 04:05:44.198
TRAVIS: Edge of the city, was there
an incursion within the city?

5629
04:05:44.198 --> 04:05:46.136
MATT: "We didn't get anything beyond just the knowledge

5630
04:05:46.136 --> 04:05:47.783
"that apparently, there was--"

5631
04:05:47.783 --> 04:05:49.442
TALIESIN: Where did this knowledge come from?

5632
04:05:49.442 --> 04:05:50.770
LAURA: I'm kneeling down--
MATT: "We received a message."

5633
04:05:50.770 --> 04:05:52.289
LAURA: --setting up my Scrying circle.

5634
04:05:52.289 --> 04:05:54.030
SAM: You were sent a message from whom?

5635
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:57.363
MATT: "From one of the various interconnected

5636
04:05:59.224 --> 04:06:01.880
"messengers of the local crownsguards.

5637
04:06:01.880 --> 04:06:03.981
"They have a few individuals that,

5638
04:06:03.981 --> 04:06:05.647
"in emergency circumstances,

5639
04:06:05.647 --> 04:06:07.736
"would send out to--"
TALIESIN: It's the Laughing Hand,

5640
04:06:07.736 --> 04:06:12.736
I think this is Yasha, I think this is Obann.

5641
04:06:12.793 --> 04:06:13.979
SAM: Okay.

5642
04:06:13.979 --> 04:06:15.454
She's going to Scry.

5643
04:06:15.454 --> 04:06:17.250
MATT: Who are you Scrying on?
LAURA: Yasha again.

5644
04:06:17.250 --> 04:06:19.173
MATT: Yasha again?

5645
04:06:19.173 --> 04:06:20.106
Okay.

5646
04:06:20.106 --> 04:06:24.093
SAM: While she's doing that,
I'm going to just go and stroke Caleb's hair

5647
04:06:24.093 --> 04:06:27.429
and say: It's okay, you got to calm down, buddy.

5648
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:30.096
MATT: Yasha has a really low wisdom.

5649
04:06:31.373 --> 04:06:32.371
16?

5650
04:06:32.371 --> 04:06:33.701
LAURA: 17!
MATT: Okay.

5651
04:06:33.701 --> 04:06:36.170
LAURA: That's why I Scryed on Yasha. (laughs)

5652
04:06:36.170 --> 04:06:37.003
MATT: Okay.

5653
04:06:38.978 --> 04:06:40.583
You sit there and focus for a bit,

5654
04:06:40.583 --> 04:06:42.049
and you're all nervous, you're looking around,

5655
04:06:42.049 --> 04:06:46.832
and occasionally, you can see, off in the distance,

5656
04:06:47.912 --> 04:06:50.735
a little bit of activity, and hear some shouts,

5657
04:06:50.735 --> 04:06:51.769
but they're echoing around,

5658
04:06:51.769 --> 04:06:54.474
and it's too much and not enough.

5659
04:06:54.474 --> 04:06:56.975
The city is so big that it's like looking over

5660
04:06:56.975 --> 04:06:58.583
the entire valley of Los Angeles

5661
04:06:58.583 --> 04:07:02.410
and trying to pick out where a fistfight is.

5662
04:07:02.410 --> 04:07:03.694
TALIESIN: Mary Poppins.

5663
04:07:03.694 --> 04:07:04.527
MATT: Yeah.

5664
04:07:04.527 --> 04:07:06.468
LIAM: Are we hearing cries?

5665
04:07:06.468 --> 04:07:08.142
MATT: You're hearing conversation, you're hearing yells,

5666
04:07:08.142 --> 04:07:11.061
but a lot of it is just general social din

5667
04:07:11.061 --> 04:07:13.444
and people that seem to be hearing rumors,

5668
04:07:13.444 --> 04:07:15.917
or worried, but not quite know what's going on.

5669
04:07:15.917 --> 04:07:17.390
LIAM: Just thousands of voices.

5670
04:07:17.390 --> 04:07:22.206
MATT: Yeah, it's chaos, as far as a social environment

5671
04:07:22.206 --> 04:07:24.806
in an urban sprawl.

5672
04:07:26.196 --> 04:07:27.029
Yasha.

5673
04:07:28.087 --> 04:07:32.234
As you focus in, is walking through the city still.

5674
04:07:32.234 --> 04:07:35.388
You see her walking intently,

5675
04:07:35.388 --> 04:07:37.455
and on the peripheral, where the edges

5676
04:07:37.455 --> 04:07:42.054
of the immediate glance of your Scry fuzzes,

5677
04:07:42.054 --> 04:07:46.162
you can see the figures, described previously by Pumat,

5678
04:07:46.162 --> 04:07:47.495
following along.

5679
04:07:48.561 --> 04:07:50.890
LIAM: Look for landmarks.
MATT: No violence.

5680
04:07:50.890 --> 04:07:53.327
People just walking by, some people giving strange looks

5681
04:07:53.327 --> 04:07:55.099
as they go, but they seem to be

5682
04:07:55.099 --> 04:07:57.613
going about their business or rushing past.

5683
04:07:57.613 --> 04:08:01.126
A few crownsguard go charging by, you hear some shouts,

5684
04:08:01.126 --> 04:08:02.775
but it's all muffled and can't really make it out,

5685
04:08:02.775 --> 04:08:07.576
as the focus is on this particular individual, on Yasha.

5686
04:08:08.740 --> 04:08:11.040
They're bee-lining somewhere.

5687
04:08:11.040 --> 04:08:13.731
LAURA: Do I see any landmarks,

5688
04:08:13.731 --> 04:08:15.341
any tall building, like spires,

5689
04:08:15.341 --> 04:08:19.193
or shop signs that she's passing by?

5690
04:08:19.193 --> 04:08:20.661
MATT: Make a perception check.

5691
04:08:20.661 --> 04:08:22.087
SAM: Come on.

5692
04:08:22.087 --> 04:08:22.920
Guidance.

5693
04:08:22.920 --> 04:08:25.003
TALIESIN: Just do better than me.

5694
04:08:27.235 --> 04:08:28.973
Better than me.

5695
04:08:28.973 --> 04:08:30.308
LAURA: 21.
MATT: 21?

5696
04:08:31.553 --> 04:08:33.894
You can make out the cobblestone street a little bit,

5697
04:08:33.894 --> 04:08:35.299
you can make out shapes.
LAURA: What color is it?

5698
04:08:35.299 --> 04:08:36.924
MATT: It's...

5699
04:08:38.232 --> 04:08:40.294
this is-- it's like a dull brown.

5700
04:08:40.294 --> 04:08:42.461
LAURA: Dull brown cobblestones.

5701
04:08:43.522 --> 04:08:45.070
MATT: Not much beyond that, unfortunately.

5702
04:08:45.070 --> 04:08:47.749
The Scry is limited, and you didn't quite roll high enough

5703
04:08:47.749 --> 04:08:50.675
to make out anything beyond just the shapes

5704
04:08:50.675 --> 04:08:54.542
on the exterior of the street and people rushing past.

5705
04:08:54.542 --> 04:08:56.064
LAURA: But they haven't started attacking at all?

5706
04:08:56.064 --> 04:08:58.354
SAM: That's not her.
MATT: You see no violence.

5707
04:08:58.354 --> 04:08:59.249
You don't know where they're heading.

5708
04:08:59.249 --> 04:09:00.366
TALIESIN: Might be a distraction.

5709
04:09:00.366 --> 04:09:01.759
LAURA: Yeah, it's possible.

5710
04:09:01.759 --> 04:09:05.097
SAM: So you could either, someone could turn into an eagle

5711
04:09:05.097 --> 04:09:06.575
and do some swoops around the city,

5712
04:09:06.575 --> 04:09:08.730
or you could Scry on Vence first.

5713
04:09:08.730 --> 04:09:11.968
LAURA: Her neck, is it totally lit up?

5714
04:09:11.968 --> 04:09:14.393
MATT: With that perception check,

5715
04:09:14.393 --> 04:09:18.310
her hood is still up, so you can't really tell,

5716
04:09:19.621 --> 04:09:22.135
but just looking at her face, you can see that she has

5717
04:09:22.135 --> 04:09:25.904
that same intense, conflicted look,

5718
04:09:25.904 --> 04:09:27.486
the brow is furrowed.

5719
04:09:27.486 --> 04:09:30.498
While she's walking with absolute purpose,

5720
04:09:30.498 --> 04:09:32.579
Terminator-walking through the street,

5721
04:09:32.579 --> 04:09:35.000
there is an expression that looks sorrowful

5722
04:09:35.000 --> 04:09:35.833
and...

5723
04:09:38.516 --> 04:09:39.741
regretful.

5724
04:09:40.600 --> 04:09:42.871
LAURA: The Laughing Hand, does he seem like he's walking

5725
04:09:42.871 --> 04:09:45.538
weird or weak or anything?

5726
04:09:46.822 --> 04:09:49.892
MATT: He is walking alongside, from what you can make out,

5727
04:09:49.892 --> 04:09:51.794
nearby, like three feet from her.

5728
04:09:51.794 --> 04:09:53.747
You can just make out the shape and the movement.

5729
04:09:53.747 --> 04:09:56.502
Each step, from your memory,

5730
04:09:56.502 --> 04:09:58.642
it walks with the same gait,

5731
04:09:58.642 --> 04:10:02.534
though the weight behind it seems to be

5732
04:10:02.534 --> 04:10:04.638
a little bit off-kilter.

5733
04:10:04.638 --> 04:10:05.649
LAURA: Okay.

5734
04:10:09.295 --> 04:10:12.025
Yeah, I can't see anything around her,

5735
04:10:12.025 --> 04:10:14.676
it's just buildings, it's just shapes.

5736
04:10:15.984 --> 04:10:18.844
But they're not where the fighting is.

5737
04:10:18.844 --> 04:10:21.434
LIAM: So we see the city, we see the sprawl,

5738
04:10:21.434 --> 04:10:23.001
but we don't see any attacks?

5739
04:10:23.001 --> 04:10:26.567
Do we see the edges of the walls around the city?

5740
04:10:26.567 --> 04:10:28.893
MATT: From this perspective, no.

5741
04:10:28.893 --> 04:10:32.298
It's too far, and the walls are about as tall

5742
04:10:32.298 --> 04:10:35.017
as the sprawl is on the edges.

5743
04:10:35.017 --> 04:10:36.943
It doesn't loom over so high.

5744
04:10:36.943 --> 04:10:38.691
Some of the buildings in there are pretty tall,

5745
04:10:38.691 --> 04:10:39.611
and from this distance,

5746
04:10:39.611 --> 04:10:41.425
and with the terrible perception roll

5747
04:10:41.425 --> 04:10:44.456
that represented the group's perception check,

5748
04:10:44.456 --> 04:10:47.807
it's real hard to make out much anything,

5749
04:10:47.807 --> 04:10:51.084
especially with the rainfall that's now hitting the city,

5750
04:10:51.084 --> 04:10:56.084
it's dampening some of the long-distance visual range.

5751
04:10:57.751 --> 04:10:58.896
TRAVIS: We should go whe-- what?

5752
04:10:58.896 --> 04:11:00.760
SAM: He wants to scan the city.

5753
04:11:00.760 --> 04:11:01.817
LIAM: Come with me.

5754
04:11:01.817 --> 04:11:02.996
SAM: Yes.

5755
04:11:02.996 --> 04:11:05.363
LIAM: (whooshes) Giant eagle.

5756
04:11:05.363 --> 04:11:08.182
MATT: Okay. (whooshes)

5757
04:11:08.182 --> 04:11:09.316
LIAM: Pull Nott up into the air.

5758
04:11:09.316 --> 04:11:10.886
MATT: All right. (whooshes)

5759
04:11:10.886 --> 04:11:12.899
LIAM: I want to try to ring the city.

5760
04:11:12.899 --> 04:11:15.950
MATT: You begin to see, at this point,

5761
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:18.112
as you go up into the sky, through the rain,

5762
04:11:18.112 --> 04:11:19.521
and some of the perception comes in,

5763
04:11:19.521 --> 04:11:21.175
there are griffon riders in the sky,

5764
04:11:21.175 --> 04:11:24.116
which are some of the military defense of the capital,

5765
04:11:24.116 --> 04:11:26.730
specifically, but a lot of the northern area.

5766
04:11:26.730 --> 04:11:29.502
The minute you head up into that area,

5767
04:11:29.502 --> 04:11:32.236
three of them turn immediately to this gargantuan eagle

5768
04:11:32.236 --> 04:11:35.069
that has suddenly taken to the skies, unapproved,

5769
04:11:35.069 --> 04:11:37.194
unnoticed, in the middle of what seems to be

5770
04:11:37.194 --> 04:11:40.599
some sort of a threat or danger,

5771
04:11:40.599 --> 04:11:42.758
and they all bee-line right towards you.

5772
04:11:42.758 --> 04:11:45.962
LIAM: In the moment that I'm elevated, and we're here,

5773
04:11:45.962 --> 04:11:48.323
do we see anything in that second that we are here

5774
04:11:48.323 --> 04:11:49.483
that we did not see before?

5775
04:11:49.483 --> 04:11:51.651
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

5776
04:11:51.651 --> 04:11:53.479
LIAM: Both of us.

5777
04:11:53.479 --> 04:11:55.204
SAM: This is not going to work for me.

5778
04:11:55.204 --> 04:11:57.575
MATT: However, I think you get advantage as an eagle.

5779
04:11:57.575 --> 04:11:58.923
LIAM: As an eagle with sight.

5780
04:11:58.923 --> 04:12:01.812
MATT: Right, so it's just a single roll then.

5781
04:12:01.812 --> 04:12:03.882
LIAM: Oh, could've been better.

5782
04:12:04.849 --> 04:12:06.346
Where'd my giant eagle go?

5783
04:12:06.346 --> 04:12:08.346
Where my giant eagle at?

5784
04:12:09.225 --> 04:12:11.202
It's just a nine.

5785
04:12:11.202 --> 04:12:12.999
SAM: 14 for me.

5786
04:12:12.999 --> 04:12:15.434
MATT: In being distracted by seeing these griffon riders

5787
04:12:15.434 --> 04:12:18.113
come at you, the rain that's pouring down,

5788
04:12:18.113 --> 04:12:20.015
that's limiting your vision already,

5789
04:12:20.015 --> 04:12:22.432
the low fog begins to come up from the streets.

5790
04:12:22.432 --> 04:12:24.438
When the temperature meets with the general heat

5791
04:12:24.438 --> 04:12:26.059
of the populace, especially when they're crowded

5792
04:12:26.059 --> 04:12:29.248
in certain spaces, you can't make out anything.

5793
04:12:30.173 --> 04:12:32.726
LIAM: Okay, and where are we, in that split second?

5794
04:12:32.726 --> 04:12:36.340
Where are we in relation to where we were

5795
04:12:36.340 --> 04:12:39.587
on the ledge with our friends?

5796
04:12:39.587 --> 04:12:43.753
MATT: You are, at this point, I'd say about 100 to 150 feet

5797
04:12:43.753 --> 04:12:46.191
above them and to the east,

5798
04:12:46.191 --> 04:12:48.645
which puts you a little more into the city,

5799
04:12:48.645 --> 04:12:49.868
which is when you were trying to get a view,

5800
04:12:49.868 --> 04:12:52.906
you probably would've leaned further in there.

5801
04:12:52.906 --> 04:12:56.491
LIAM: Okay, seeing those things encroach,

5802
04:12:56.491 --> 04:12:59.351
I just drop it, turn back into Caleb,

5803
04:12:59.351 --> 04:13:02.359
and I start to plummet, and I let us plummet for a while,

5804
04:13:02.359 --> 04:13:05.183
and then eventually cast Feather Fall.

5805
04:13:05.183 --> 04:13:06.561
MATT: Okay.

5806
04:13:06.561 --> 04:13:09.601
They're still giving chase.
LIAM: That's fine.

5807
04:13:09.601 --> 04:13:11.916
MATT: You fall faster than they fly.

5808
04:13:11.916 --> 04:13:14.808
Or pretty equal as they go into a dive,

5809
04:13:14.808 --> 04:13:18.370
but you're falling, and falling, and falling.

5810
04:13:18.370 --> 04:13:21.084
You Feather Fall at the last minute,

5811
04:13:21.084 --> 04:13:23.751
they pull up and then head over.

5812
04:13:24.633 --> 04:13:26.082
One of them stops on a nearby roof,

5813
04:13:26.082 --> 04:13:31.082
the griffon, coming to a halt, perching over there.

5814
04:13:31.148 --> 04:13:33.447
(screeches) Looking over in the direction

5815
04:13:33.447 --> 04:13:34.280
where you guys had fallen.

5816
04:13:34.280 --> 04:13:36.642
The soldier on top looking down

5817
04:13:36.642 --> 04:13:38.266
and trying to see where you guys had fallen

5818
04:13:38.266 --> 04:13:40.045
while the other two veer off,

5819
04:13:40.045 --> 04:13:41.652
possibly in pursuit of other dangers.

5820
04:13:41.652 --> 04:13:43.130
LIAM: Are we ground-level now?

5821
04:13:43.130 --> 04:13:45.142
MATT: You guys are now ground-level.

5822
04:13:45.142 --> 04:13:47.701
LIAM: Are we within sight of them?

5823
04:13:47.701 --> 04:13:48.985
Or just off somewhere?

5824
04:13:48.985 --> 04:13:53.177
MATT: You guys have fallen within the city roof lines,

5825
04:13:53.177 --> 04:13:54.484
so you guys have no sight on them.

5826
04:13:54.484 --> 04:13:55.660
You watch them (whooshes)

5827
04:13:55.660 --> 04:13:56.867
and then just vanish into the city.

5828
04:13:56.867 --> 04:13:57.940
LIAM: Try to message the others,

5829
04:13:57.940 --> 04:14:00.458
and I just raise my hands up into the sky

5830
04:14:00.458 --> 04:14:02.908
to show that I'm not doing anything.

5831
04:14:02.908 --> 04:14:04.280
And wait.

5832
04:14:04.280 --> 04:14:05.280
MATT: All right.

5833
04:14:06.737 --> 04:14:07.856
Most people scatter

5834
04:14:07.856 --> 04:14:09.914
with the griffon landing on the roof.

5835
04:14:09.914 --> 04:14:11.467
The griffon then swoops down (whooshes)

5836
04:14:11.467 --> 04:14:14.642
and lands on the cobblestone center of the street

5837
04:14:14.642 --> 04:14:19.193
next to you, heavy impact, and the guard immediately says,

5838
04:14:19.193 --> 04:14:20.477
"Who are you, what's your business?"

5839
04:14:20.477 --> 04:14:22.841
SAM: As it was coming, I disguised myself as a halfling.

5840
04:14:22.841 --> 04:14:23.699
MATT: Okay.

5841
04:14:23.699 --> 04:14:27.100
LIAM: I try to subtly step in front of Nott

5842
04:14:27.100 --> 04:14:29.138
at the same time.

5843
04:14:29.138 --> 04:14:31.138
We are here from Zadash.

5844
04:14:32.443 --> 04:14:35.761
We got word that there is trouble in the city.

5845
04:14:35.761 --> 04:14:38.275
I am a citizen of Rexxentrum,

5846
04:14:38.275 --> 04:14:40.515
and I have come to do my part.

5847
04:14:40.515 --> 04:14:42.682
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

5848
04:14:44.297 --> 04:14:45.547
SAM: Come on, Cay.

5849
04:14:48.297 --> 04:14:49.618
Come on, Cay-Cay.

5850
04:14:49.618 --> 04:14:50.541
LIAM: Six.

5851
04:14:50.541 --> 04:14:51.374
SAM: Ooh!

5852
04:14:57.144 --> 04:14:59.561
MATT: He steps off of the griffon

5853
04:15:01.987 --> 04:15:06.699
and approaches, pulling the blade from the side,

5854
04:15:06.699 --> 04:15:09.174
and looking at you, he just walks up.

5855
04:15:11.252 --> 04:15:12.454
"Well, then you have to come with me

5856
04:15:12.454 --> 04:15:16.024
"and explain this to the captain of the guard."

5857
04:15:16.024 --> 04:15:17.024
LIAM: Of course.

5858
04:15:18.714 --> 04:15:19.547
MATT: "Come."

5859
04:15:19.547 --> 04:15:20.463
LIAM: Lead the way.

5860
04:15:20.463 --> 04:15:21.616
SAM: Is it just one guard?

5861
04:15:21.616 --> 04:15:22.741
MATT: Just one guard.

5862
04:15:22.741 --> 04:15:23.926
SAM: I'll ca-- fuck.

5863
04:15:23.926 --> 04:15:27.041
(Travis and Liam laugh)

5864
04:15:27.041 --> 04:15:28.739
TALIESIN: Well, this is going to go well.

5865
04:15:28.739 --> 04:15:30.984
SAM: It's not going to go well at all.

5866
04:15:30.984 --> 04:15:32.484
LIAM: Where are the other riders? They're up in the air?

5867
04:15:32.484 --> 04:15:34.184
MATT: They're up in the air.

5868
04:15:34.184 --> 04:15:37.708
You caught the eye of a handful, and one of them pursued.

5869
04:15:37.708 --> 04:15:39.634
You don't seem as much of an immediate danger,

5870
04:15:39.634 --> 04:15:43.217
more of a person of interest and a concern.

5871
04:15:44.692 --> 04:15:45.631
What are you doing, Nott?

5872
04:15:45.631 --> 04:15:46.747
SAM: (sighs)

5873
04:15:48.553 --> 04:15:50.042
Got to get out of here.

5874
04:15:50.042 --> 04:15:51.003
LIAM: Is he on foot?

5875
04:15:51.003 --> 04:15:51.836
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

5876
04:15:51.836 --> 04:15:52.925
MATT: The griffon's like there,

5877
04:15:52.925 --> 04:15:55.014
maybe 10 feet from him currently.

5878
04:15:55.014 --> 04:15:57.855
SAM: I'll cast Phantasmal Force on him.

5879
04:15:57.855 --> 04:15:59.663
TRAVIS: (inhales loudly)

5880
04:15:59.663 --> 04:16:00.496
MATT: Okay.

5881
04:16:00.496 --> 04:16:03.079
TRAVIS: (sighs)

5882
04:16:04.081 --> 04:16:05.964
MATT: That would be...

5883
04:16:06.806 --> 04:16:08.220
a 12.

5884
04:16:08.220 --> 04:16:09.887
SAM: Okay, so it works.

5885
04:16:11.858 --> 04:16:15.722
I will make him think that his griffon

5886
04:16:15.722 --> 04:16:19.579
is starting to get loose and run away.

5887
04:16:19.579 --> 04:16:22.344
MATT: Okay, and he goes, "Wait, no!

5888
04:16:22.344 --> 04:16:23.815
"Jamal, what do you--?

5889
04:16:23.815 --> 04:16:25.679
(laughter)

5890
04:16:25.679 --> 04:16:26.637
And the griffon's like,

5891
04:16:26.637 --> 04:16:28.045
(grunts confusedly)

5892
04:16:30.632 --> 04:16:32.938
And is following him as he's shouting and making calls.

5893
04:16:32.938 --> 04:16:33.771
(clicking)

5894
04:16:33.771 --> 04:16:35.961
"Jamal! Stay put, I'll be right back."

5895
04:16:35.961 --> 04:16:37.875
LIAM: Of course, I'm here to do my part.

5896
04:16:37.875 --> 04:16:40.392
As soon as his back turns, I cast Fly on the both of us,

5897
04:16:40.392 --> 04:16:41.480
with a Raven's Feather.

5898
04:16:41.480 --> 04:16:43.244
MATT: Okay. (whooshes)

5899
04:16:43.244 --> 04:16:44.558
You both--
LIAM: Jet.

5900
04:16:44.558 --> 04:16:45.522
SAM: Jet.

5901
04:16:45.522 --> 04:16:47.895
While this is happening, what are you guys doing?

5902
04:16:47.895 --> 04:16:49.152
LIAM: Building tops.

5903
04:16:49.152 --> 04:16:51.957
LAURA: Just staring out, like what the fuck just happened?

5904
04:16:51.957 --> 04:16:54.265
(laughter)

5905
04:16:54.265 --> 04:16:57.886
TRAVIS: They flew, and then we saw them just plummet, right?

5906
04:16:57.886 --> 04:17:00.085
Can anyone see-- can you see him?

5907
04:17:00.085 --> 04:17:01.201
TALIESIN: What?

5908
04:17:02.108 --> 04:17:06.333
TRAVIS: We still need to know where this is happening.

5909
04:17:06.333 --> 04:17:07.550
Does someone else want to try?

5910
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:09.004
SAM: You got a Pumat, you can use a Pumat!

5911
04:17:09.004 --> 04:17:10.114
TRAVIS: Going out there, I don't know,

5912
04:17:10.114 --> 04:17:13.462
as like a regular-ass bird or something.

5913
04:17:13.462 --> 04:17:15.733
LAURA: I mean, I could try, sure,

5914
04:17:15.733 --> 04:17:17.838
I'm going to Polymorph myself.

5915
04:17:17.838 --> 04:17:18.777
SAM: Into what?

5916
04:17:18.777 --> 04:17:19.777
LAURA: A sparrow.

5917
04:17:21.520 --> 04:17:22.925
MATT: What are you looking for?

5918
04:17:22.925 --> 04:17:25.285
Visibility is pretty bad, but it's possible.

5919
04:17:25.285 --> 04:17:27.966
LIAM: Did they see any of these griffon riders?

5920
04:17:27.966 --> 04:17:29.909
MATT: Once they went after Caleb, yeah.

5921
04:17:29.909 --> 04:17:31.197
LIAM: Okay.

5922
04:17:31.197 --> 04:17:33.146
TALIESIN: Why don't we be clever about this?

5923
04:17:33.146 --> 04:17:35.410
Let's figure out where they could possibly be heading.

5924
04:17:35.410 --> 04:17:38.168
Let's see if we can cut them off.

5925
04:17:38.168 --> 04:17:39.658
I've got Locate Creature.

5926
04:17:39.658 --> 04:17:41.941
MARISHA: I mean, they plummeted right over there.

5927
04:17:41.941 --> 04:17:43.691
They're not that far.

5928
04:17:44.820 --> 04:17:45.974
SAM: I love your concern.

5929
04:17:45.974 --> 04:17:48.314
MATT: Pumat's like, "Anything I can do?"

5930
04:17:48.314 --> 04:17:50.529
LAURA: Can you Polymorph?

5931
04:17:50.529 --> 04:17:52.054
MATT: "Nah, I didn't really--

5932
04:17:52.054 --> 04:17:54.204
"I didn't prepare that one, I'm sorry."

5933
04:17:54.204 --> 04:17:55.488
LAURA: No, it's okay.

5934
04:17:55.488 --> 04:17:57.295
MATT: "I can still Scry.

5935
04:17:57.295 --> 04:18:00.086
"Do you want me to look after that Yasha friend?"

5936
04:18:01.086 --> 04:18:02.862
MARISHA: Maybe here in like a minute.

5937
04:18:02.862 --> 04:18:04.408
TALIESIN: Let's see if we can figure out where they're going

5938
04:18:04.408 --> 04:18:06.756
in a second, see if we can get some idea

5939
04:18:06.756 --> 04:18:09.191
of what they're heading towards.

5940
04:18:09.191 --> 04:18:10.952
MATT: "You said you knew a cultist, right?"

5941
04:18:10.952 --> 04:18:11.785
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5942
04:18:13.410 --> 04:18:16.778
Well, where would you put a cult in this town?

5943
04:18:16.778 --> 04:18:18.631
LAURA: Have you ever been to Rexxentrum?

5944
04:18:18.631 --> 04:18:20.773
MATT: "Ooh, it's been a long time ago.

5945
04:18:20.773 --> 04:18:23.167
"Like five years."
LAURA: Am I a sparrow right now?

5946
04:18:23.167 --> 04:18:25.156
MATT: Have you committed to your Polymorph?

5947
04:18:25.156 --> 04:18:27.596
LAURA: Well, I said I did it, so it seems--

5948
04:18:27.596 --> 04:18:28.701
MATT: Well, I'm just ensuring.

5949
04:18:28.701 --> 04:18:29.726
You seemed uncertain.

5950
04:18:29.726 --> 04:18:31.429
LAURA: Well, I am.
MATT: Okay.

5951
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:32.587
(laughter)

5952
04:18:32.587 --> 04:18:35.379
All right.
LIAM: Only because I am.

5953
04:18:35.379 --> 04:18:37.344
TALIESIN: Maybe if we figure out where they could--

5954
04:18:37.344 --> 04:18:41.099
I mean, we've got some leads on maybe where a cult might be.

5955
04:18:42.224 --> 04:18:44.012
MARISHA: Wait, do we?
LAURA: Oh, what?

5956
04:18:44.012 --> 04:18:45.870
MATT: "Where the cu--

5957
04:18:45.870 --> 04:18:48.147
"If you know cultists, I mean--"

5958
04:18:48.147 --> 04:18:49.473
TALIESIN: Where would that be?

5959
04:18:49.473 --> 04:18:51.144
TRAVIS: Where would you find a compound in this city?

5960
04:18:51.144 --> 04:18:53.883
We were just talking-- no we weren't, nevermind.

5961
04:18:53.883 --> 04:18:55.903
Fuck, I don't know any of that shit.

5962
04:18:55.903 --> 04:18:59.079
LAURA: We're supposed to look for the High Curator.

5963
04:18:59.079 --> 04:19:03.024
MATT: By which point, Archivist Kathedoc, he goes,

5964
04:19:03.024 --> 04:19:04.753
"The High Curator is currently out meeting

5965
04:19:04.753 --> 04:19:06.309
"with the Crown's Council

5966
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:08.583
"before these attacks seemingly began.

5967
04:19:08.583 --> 04:19:10.402
"So he's not around, but will probably be back

5968
04:19:10.402 --> 04:19:12.493
"in the next hour or two."
MARISHA: Wait, what?

5969
04:19:13.760 --> 04:19:15.570
TRAVIS: The Crown's Council?

5970
04:19:15.570 --> 04:19:16.997
MATT: "The Crown's Council."

5971
04:19:16.997 --> 04:19:19.069
MARISHA: Who's that?

5972
04:19:19.069 --> 04:19:21.933
MATT: "It's all of the individuals around the King that--"

5973
04:19:21.933 --> 04:19:24.043
MARISHA: All of the important people in the city

5974
04:19:24.043 --> 04:19:26.916
are conveniently meeting right now during this attack,

5975
04:19:26.916 --> 04:19:28.299
is that what you're telling me?

5976
04:19:28.299 --> 04:19:31.142
MATT: "They're there most of the time
to have conversations."

5977
04:19:31.142 --> 04:19:33.057
MARISHA: What?
LAURA: Where's the Council?

5978
04:19:33.057 --> 04:19:34.115
MARISHA: Yeah.

5979
04:19:34.115 --> 04:19:35.529
LAURA: Where's the castle?

5980
04:19:35.529 --> 04:19:38.198
MATT: "It's--" points over there.

5981
04:19:38.198 --> 04:19:40.154
LAURA: We should go there.

5982
04:19:40.154 --> 04:19:41.617
SAM: She's a noncommittal sparrow.

5983
04:19:41.617 --> 04:19:42.962
LAURA: I didn't commit.

5984
04:19:42.962 --> 04:19:45.051
MATT: Okay, so you didn't commit.

5985
04:19:45.051 --> 04:19:47.480
TRAVIS: Let's head to that castle then.

5986
04:19:47.480 --> 04:19:49.147
SAM: Castle Ooh--(gurgling noises)?

5987
04:19:50.565 --> 04:19:52.240
TALIESIN: Where's Caleb? You are back.

5988
04:19:52.240 --> 04:19:54.022
SAM: No, we're not.
MATT: No, they're still gone.

5989
04:19:54.022 --> 04:19:56.603
SAM: We're flying around.
MATT: Yeah, they're flying around.

5990
04:19:56.603 --> 04:19:58.985
LAURA: Can you see anything?
MATT: (as Pumat) "Before we go blindly

5991
04:19:58.985 --> 04:20:01.885
"into anywhere, is there any indication--?"

5992
04:20:03.351 --> 04:20:05.592
LAURA: Where they're heading, where the cult would meet?

5993
04:20:05.592 --> 04:20:06.700
MATT: "Yeah."

5994
04:20:06.700 --> 04:20:08.405
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, let me think about this.
MATT: "Is there anybody else,

5995
04:20:08.405 --> 04:20:10.700
"any place else, anything connected to these guys?"

5996
04:20:10.700 --> 04:20:12.298
LAURA: I mean, there's Vence.

5997
04:20:12.298 --> 04:20:14.101
TALIESIN: There's Vence, we should do that.

5998
04:20:14.101 --> 04:20:14.934
MARISHA: I pore through my notes,

5999
04:20:14.934 --> 04:20:16.179
I'm actually poring through my notes,

6000
04:20:16.179 --> 04:20:18.548
but then Beau pores through her notes.

6001
04:20:18.548 --> 04:20:20.155
MATT: All right, so you're going through your notes.

6002
04:20:20.155 --> 04:20:22.086
MARISHA: Do I remember anything?

6003
04:20:22.086 --> 04:20:24.855
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

6004
04:20:24.855 --> 04:20:28.152
SAM: There's Candles, there's Castle Ungebroch,

6005
04:20:28.152 --> 04:20:29.841
there's Astrid's house.

6006
04:20:29.841 --> 04:20:31.465
MARISHA: Fuck!
SAM: There's the Court of Colors.

6007
04:20:31.465 --> 04:20:33.008
MARISHA: We're fucking garbage today.

6008
04:20:33.008 --> 04:20:34.954
We're garbage people.
MATT: Sorry.

6009
04:20:34.954 --> 04:20:36.732
MARISHA: Seven.
MATT: Seven.

6010
04:20:36.732 --> 04:20:37.861
Not quite--
SAM: Jesus, guys!

6011
04:20:37.861 --> 04:20:40.119
MATT: -- clicking anything in the notes.

6012
04:20:41.280 --> 04:20:43.054
LAURA: I feel like there's--

6013
04:20:43.054 --> 04:20:44.827
I feel like we should know something.

6014
04:20:44.827 --> 04:20:46.247
MARISHA: I know.

6015
04:20:46.247 --> 04:20:47.852
SAM: Here's all we got.

6016
04:20:47.852 --> 04:20:52.353
Astrid's house, Shimmer Ward, Castle Ook-ah-rock,

6017
04:20:52.353 --> 04:20:56.603
Candles, Tangles, Court of Colors, Crown's Council.

6018
04:20:58.227 --> 04:20:59.780
That's all we got. (laughs)

6019
04:20:59.780 --> 04:21:01.080
LAURA: I'm... going to...

6020
04:21:01.080 --> 04:21:03.022
Scry on Vence?

6021
04:21:03.022 --> 04:21:04.381
I'm going to Scry on Vence!

6022
04:21:04.381 --> 04:21:06.103
MATT: Going to Scry on Vence, okay.

6023
04:21:06.103 --> 04:21:08.295
LAURA: I'm committing to that one.

6024
04:21:08.295 --> 04:21:10.461
SAM: ♪ Noncommittal sparrow ♪

6025
04:21:10.461 --> 04:21:12.844
(laughter)

6026
04:21:12.844 --> 04:21:14.894
TALIESIN: I mean, I like you.
LAURA: One of my arms

6027
04:21:14.894 --> 04:21:17.894
is a teeny-tiny sparrow wing, and that's it,

6028
04:21:17.894 --> 04:21:20.463
just because I couldn't fully--

6029
04:21:20.463 --> 04:21:23.013
SAM: You got a wing hand?

6030
04:21:23.013 --> 04:21:25.299
MATT: All right, as the rain is pouring down

6031
04:21:25.299 --> 04:21:26.488
and soaking all of you out here

6032
04:21:26.488 --> 04:21:28.548
on the top of the terrace,

6033
04:21:28.548 --> 04:21:30.475
you begin to prepare the Scry ritual.

6034
04:21:30.475 --> 04:21:31.453
It takes 10 minutes to do so.

6035
04:21:31.453 --> 04:21:33.544
You guys fly over (whooshes),

6036
04:21:33.544 --> 04:21:35.412
and land perched back on,

6037
04:21:35.412 --> 04:21:40.079
as you can see Jester rapidly preparing for this ritual.

6038
04:21:41.764 --> 04:21:44.018
At this point, you do hear,

6039
04:21:44.018 --> 04:21:45.450
partway through your preparation,

6040
04:21:45.450 --> 04:21:47.356
about seven or eight minutes into it,

6041
04:21:47.356 --> 04:21:50.031
you hear some shouts

6042
04:21:50.031 --> 04:21:53.647
and what seems like some sort of distant muffled explosion

6043
04:21:53.647 --> 04:21:56.747
to the north of where you currently are.

6044
04:21:56.747 --> 04:21:58.080
SAM: We got a lead!

6045
04:21:59.960 --> 04:22:01.401
LIAM: Judging by the sound,

6046
04:22:01.401 --> 04:22:04.188
is it at the walls of the city?

6047
04:22:04.188 --> 04:22:06.302
MATT: It seems within the city.

6048
04:22:06.302 --> 04:22:08.499
SAM: We don't see any smoke or anything?

6049
04:22:08.499 --> 04:22:09.851
MATT: No smoke.
TALIESIN: Is there anything we can do

6050
04:22:09.851 --> 04:22:13.319
to move through the city without being caught up

6051
04:22:13.319 --> 04:22:16.561
by the security of the city itself?

6052
04:22:18.295 --> 04:22:20.379
LIAM: Well, the air is not good.

6053
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:25.813
I mean, it's not a coincidence that they are here

6054
04:22:25.813 --> 04:22:27.932
and this is happening.
TALIESIN: I don't believe so.

6055
04:22:27.932 --> 04:22:31.216
LIAM: Something just exploded in that direction.

6056
04:22:31.216 --> 04:22:32.732
SAM: We need to go there, let's run through the city.

6057
04:22:32.732 --> 04:22:34.434
LIAM: Let Jester look, and then we head.

6058
04:22:34.434 --> 04:22:37.753
MATT: The rain is frustratingly starting to bleed

6059
04:22:37.753 --> 04:22:39.087
elements of the ritual,

6060
04:22:39.087 --> 04:22:40.810
and then you feel the rain suddenly stop,

6061
04:22:40.810 --> 04:22:42.093
and you glance up above you,

6062
04:22:42.093 --> 04:22:46.075
and you see this green cloak protecting the rainfall

6063
04:22:46.075 --> 04:22:48.158
from messing your ritual.

6064
04:22:49.116 --> 04:22:50.865
You get through the final moments of preparation,

6065
04:22:50.865 --> 04:22:52.987
you place the focus down on the center,

6066
04:22:52.987 --> 04:22:55.554
and with that, the cloak wraps around you,

6067
04:22:55.554 --> 04:22:57.892
and your vision goes dark for a second.

6068
04:22:57.892 --> 04:23:00.456
You're focusing on Vence.

6069
04:23:00.456 --> 04:23:04.248
You come to a dry place,

6070
04:23:05.423 --> 04:23:07.893
a place of light.

6071
04:23:07.893 --> 04:23:09.143
You see colors.

6072
04:23:11.716 --> 04:23:14.366
You see Vence clutching a satchel under his arm.

6073
04:23:14.366 --> 04:23:15.692
LAURA: He's got something!
MATT: He's taking steps,

6074
04:23:15.692 --> 04:23:18.016
and each step echoes across a hard floor,

6075
04:23:18.016 --> 04:23:19.183
in an open space.

6076
04:23:20.100 --> 04:23:22.186
(clicking)

6077
04:23:22.186 --> 04:23:26.402
It feels like a very large, enclosed area.

6078
04:23:26.402 --> 04:23:27.902
LAURA: Big, fancy area.

6079
04:23:28.854 --> 04:23:33.560
MATT: It's a beautiful cathedral,
with candelabras flickering,

6080
04:23:33.560 --> 04:23:37.860
massive stained glass walls on the sides in the distance.

6081
04:23:38.893 --> 04:23:43.356
A brightly adorned priest walks by hurriedly and nods.

6082
04:23:43.356 --> 04:23:44.931
LAURA: There's a priest, he nodded.

6083
04:23:44.931 --> 04:23:47.081
MATT: Vence walks into the center of the room,

6084
04:23:47.081 --> 04:23:49.156
behind the central altar,

6085
04:23:49.156 --> 04:23:51.492
where you can see an older woman

6086
04:23:51.492 --> 04:23:53.691
in elaborate red, gold, and white robes,

6087
04:23:53.691 --> 04:23:57.216
her gray hair pulled up tightly behind her head.

6088
04:23:57.216 --> 04:23:58.957
LAURA: Old woman, red, gold, and white robes.

6089
04:23:58.957 --> 04:24:03.543
MATT: Vince approaches and goes,
"Angel's Eye, Cardinal Respa."

6090
04:24:03.543 --> 04:24:04.934
LAURA: Cardinal Respa? Cardinal Respa!

6091
04:24:04.934 --> 04:24:06.734
Angel's Eye, he said Angel's Eye.

6092
04:24:06.734 --> 04:24:09.092
MATT: She returns the smile.

6093
04:24:09.092 --> 04:24:11.588
"Angel's Eye, young Vence.

6094
04:24:11.588 --> 04:24:15.220
"Have the children had luck with the secret texts?"

6095
04:24:15.220 --> 04:24:17.403
LAURA: They're talking about secret texts.

6096
04:24:17.403 --> 04:24:20.035
MATT: He hands her two scrolls.

6097
04:24:20.035 --> 04:24:22.709
LAURA: He's got scrolls, he gave her scrolls!

6098
04:24:22.709 --> 04:24:25.311
MATT: (as Vence) "Taken from the vaults of Vasselheim,

6099
04:24:25.311 --> 04:24:28.715
"these should reveal the fane below and the path to it.

6100
04:24:28.715 --> 04:24:30.520
"The regents will be on us in time,

6101
04:24:30.520 --> 04:24:33.681
"but not before our work has already begun."

6102
04:24:33.681 --> 04:24:35.736
(as Respa) "Very good.

6103
04:24:35.736 --> 04:24:38.710
"And it sounds like the diversions are already in place."

6104
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:41.017
LAURA: Oh god, they're talking about diversions!

6105
04:24:41.017 --> 04:24:43.392
MATT: (as Vence) "The seed of word has been planted.

6106
04:24:43.392 --> 04:24:45.111
"Coming off the Harvest's Rise Festival,

6107
04:24:45.111 --> 04:24:49.311
"our link in Xhorhas says the assaults are...

6108
04:24:50.769 --> 04:24:51.894
now."

6109
04:24:52.912 --> 04:24:54.742
He hands the satchel to the woman,

6110
04:24:54.742 --> 04:24:57.841
with the rest of the scrolls,

6111
04:24:57.841 --> 04:24:59.580
and you can see, with the scrolls,

6112
04:24:59.580 --> 04:25:00.523
there's something else in there,

6113
04:25:00.523 --> 04:25:03.046
some sort of familiarly shaped device.

6114
04:25:03.046 --> 04:25:05.317
LAURA: No, he's got the beacon!

6115
04:25:05.317 --> 04:25:07.796
MATT: No, it's more of a silvery disc.

6116
04:25:07.796 --> 04:25:09.778
LAURA: Oh, he's got a portal!

6117
04:25:09.778 --> 04:25:11.129
MATT: He says--

6118
04:25:12.704 --> 04:25:14.721
"Hide this within the cellar.

6119
04:25:14.721 --> 04:25:16.713
"Prepare the fane for their arrival.

6120
04:25:16.713 --> 04:25:18.407
"Greet him and his family.

6121
04:25:18.407 --> 04:25:20.282
"They should arrive very soon."

6122
04:25:20.282 --> 04:25:21.527
LAURA: Oh my god.

6123
04:25:21.527 --> 04:25:22.973
(as Respa) "Of course.

6124
04:25:22.973 --> 04:25:26.681
"And she will remember this, and so shall I, young Vence."

6125
04:25:26.681 --> 04:25:29.161
(as Vence) "Thank you, Cardinal."

6126
04:25:29.161 --> 04:25:31.027
Her eyes immediately train...

6127
04:25:31.027 --> 04:25:32.244
onto you.

6128
04:25:32.244 --> 04:25:33.409
LAURA: Me?

6129
04:25:33.409 --> 04:25:36.392
MATT: "You sniveling worm,
you walk unsheathed by distant eyes!"

6130
04:25:36.392 --> 04:25:38.400
and he goes, "No, shit, I didn't mean--!"

6131
04:25:38.400 --> 04:25:40.962
And (exhales), the ritual ends.

6132
04:25:40.962 --> 04:25:43.367
LAURA: She saw that I was Scrying, holy shit!

6133
04:25:43.367 --> 04:25:44.637
Oh my god, that was so crazy!
LIAM: From everything

6134
04:25:44.637 --> 04:25:46.840
that she was muttering, does that spark any memory,

6135
04:25:46.840 --> 04:25:48.743
the location, the church, the colors?

6136
04:25:48.743 --> 04:25:50.862
MATT: There are a number of temples throughout this city.

6137
04:25:50.862 --> 04:25:52.295
LIAM: What about the colors, red and gold?

6138
04:25:52.295 --> 04:25:55.474
MARISHA: Yeah, red and gold, who does that religion follow?

6139
04:25:55.474 --> 04:25:58.004
MATT: In Rexxentrum, those color schemes

6140
04:25:58.004 --> 04:26:00.555
tend to fall deeply into the worship of Pelor,

6141
04:26:00.555 --> 04:26:04.167
the Dawnfather, and the largest temple to the Dawnfather

6142
04:26:04.167 --> 04:26:07.668
in this city is known as Chantry of the Dawn.

6143
04:26:07.668 --> 04:26:10.979
You know this to reside to the southern edge

6144
04:26:10.979 --> 04:26:13.730
of the Shimmer Ward, within the Tangles.

6145
04:26:13.730 --> 04:26:15.955
You've passed it once or twice.

6146
04:26:19.361 --> 04:26:21.344
TRAVIS: Are we going there?
LAURA: We got to go!

6147
04:26:21.344 --> 04:26:24.110
We got to go now, or else--
LIAM: The explosion or to the temple?

6148
04:26:24.110 --> 04:26:25.465
SAM and LAURA: To the temple.

6149
04:26:25.465 --> 04:26:26.893
SAM: It's a diversion.
LAURA: They're going to try

6150
04:26:26.893 --> 04:26:29.209
to open a portal up and bring--

6151
04:26:29.209 --> 04:26:30.284
SAM: A fane?

6152
04:26:30.284 --> 04:26:32.323
LAURA: I don't even know what that is.

6153
04:26:32.323 --> 04:26:34.783
LIAM: The fane are the devices, it's the things that--

6154
04:26:34.783 --> 04:26:36.633
TRAVIS: Yeah, bringing something across.
LAURA: We got to go break it.

6155
04:26:36.633 --> 04:26:39.124
TRAVIS: We got to go. Stop talking, run, double-time!

6156
04:26:39.124 --> 04:26:40.122
SAM: Who's with us?

6157
04:26:40.122 --> 04:26:41.240
LIAM: I will lead them, I will point

6158
04:26:41.240 --> 04:26:43.460
and lead towards the temple.

6159
04:26:43.460 --> 04:26:45.808
MARISHA: Before we leave, I turn around

6160
04:26:45.808 --> 04:26:48.374
to Kad-- Kad--

6161
04:26:48.374 --> 04:26:51.480
fucking what's his name, what was his name?

6162
04:26:51.480 --> 04:26:53.546
The guy we were just talking to, the half-orc guy.

6163
04:26:53.546 --> 04:26:54.798
TRAVIS: Kathedoc?

6164
04:26:54.798 --> 04:26:56.149
MATT: Yeah, Kathedoc.

6165
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:57.316
"Catheter," yes.

6166
04:26:58.453 --> 04:27:00.004
MARISHA: I don't know where we're going,

6167
04:27:00.004 --> 04:27:03.622
and I say, you need to check in

6168
04:27:03.622 --> 04:27:05.601
with the headmaster, the Head Curator.

6169
04:27:05.601 --> 04:27:06.762
I don't think she's safe;

6170
04:27:06.762 --> 04:27:08.478
I would send over a team over there.

6171
04:27:08.478 --> 04:27:10.613
MATT: "All right, I will ensure this is taken care of."

6172
04:27:10.613 --> 04:27:12.214
MARISHA: This is a diversion.

6173
04:27:12.214 --> 04:27:15.192
There's bigger shit happening here.

6174
04:27:15.192 --> 04:27:17.917
TRAVIS: Do you want any backup sent to where we're going?

6175
04:27:17.917 --> 04:27:20.602
MARISHA: Do you have backup to spare?

6176
04:27:20.602 --> 04:27:23.065
MATT: "I can probably bring a few soldiers

6177
04:27:23.065 --> 04:27:25.287
"to meet you in that direction, yes."

6178
04:27:25.287 --> 04:27:27.505
MARISHA: Have them meet us at the Chantry of the Dawn.

6179
04:27:27.505 --> 04:27:28.684
MATT: "Very well."
(pen clatters)

6180
04:27:28.684 --> 04:27:29.994
MARISHA: I dropped my staff, hang on.

6181
04:27:29.994 --> 04:27:32.327
(laughter)

6182
04:27:34.392 --> 04:27:38.450
MATT: As this is happening, the rain

6183
04:27:38.450 --> 04:27:40.016
has subsided a bit,

6184
04:27:40.016 --> 04:27:42.582
and there's a small clearing in the clouds,

6185
04:27:42.582 --> 04:27:46.023
and a little beam of light just crests down

6186
04:27:46.023 --> 04:27:49.117
onto, loosely, the area of the city

6187
04:27:49.117 --> 04:27:51.284
where the Chantry resides.

6188
04:27:52.320 --> 04:27:54.187
SAM: Some ritual is happening.

6189
04:27:54.187 --> 04:27:55.401
LAURA: We got to go.

6190
04:27:55.401 --> 04:27:57.141
MARISHA: But isn't Pelor normally like a--

6191
04:27:57.141 --> 04:27:59.899
LIAM: So we took the stairs, winding, we're going downstairs

6192
04:27:59.899 --> 04:28:01.180
to get out of here?
MATT: Pelor was one of the ones

6193
04:28:01.180 --> 04:28:03.723
responsible for chaining--

6194
04:28:03.723 --> 04:28:05.233
TALIESIN: That's where the chain is.

6195
04:28:05.233 --> 04:28:07.041
LAURA: Oh, that's where the chain is.

6196
04:28:07.041 --> 04:28:09.590
MARISHA: Him and Melora teamed up together.

6197
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:12.229
LAURA: That's where one of the chains is,
they're going to try to break it.

6198
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:14.829
MARISHA: I mean Ioun. Right, too many gods teaming up.

6199
04:28:14.829 --> 04:28:16.592
LAURA: Let's go, let's go!
SAM: Too many gods!

MATT: As you guys grab your arms and rush your way down

6202
04:28:21.997 --> 04:28:25.290
through the Archive, into the streets of the Tangles,

6203
04:28:25.290 --> 04:28:28.199
heading eastward, deeper into the city of Rexxentrum,

6204
04:28:28.199 --> 04:28:30.304
we're going to end the episode there.

6205
04:28:30.304 --> 04:28:32.165
Pick up there next week.

6206
04:28:32.165 --> 04:28:32.998

MARISHA: What an episode.

SAM: Good rolls, guys.
MARISHA: Good rolls!

6211
04:28:40.291 --> 04:28:43.767
TALIESIN: Double ones, fucking double ones!

6212
04:28:43.767 --> 04:28:45.935
TRAVIS: Most perceptive person, double ones.

6213
04:28:45.935 --> 04:28:48.029
LIAM: Hey, that's special.

6214
04:28:48.029 --> 04:28:48.875
TALIESIN: It is.

6215
04:28:48.875 --> 04:28:50.343

MATT: (laughs)

SAM: It is, everything's coming together!

6223
04:29:04.717 --> 04:29:06.228
TALIESIN: There's a form of D&amp;D where you roll double ones,

6224
04:29:06.228 --> 04:29:08.102
and you just have a minor stroke and die,

6225
04:29:08.102 --> 04:29:09.475
just right there.

6226
04:29:09.475 --> 04:29:12.832
You just zero out your hit points, like, oh no, not now!

6227

My cholesterol!
LIAM: Tune in next week

00:00:00.144 --> 00:00:03.047
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.047 --> 00:00:05.707
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:07.810
LIAM: We play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons!

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.964
MATT: That was a good one, Liam. Well done. Before
we get started on tonight's chaos-- because we've

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:18.862
missed you guys these past two weeks. We had the
fantastic all-honey Honey Heist in this place last

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:26.182
week. Everyone did a great job on that one. Now
we're back to see what's going to happen here. We

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:29.902
left it a little chaotic last time. Before we get
to that, we have some announcements to get

00:00:29.902 --> 00:00:34.524
through, starting with our fantastic returning
sponsors of campaign two, D&amp;amp;D Beyond.

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:35.797
ALL: D&amp;amp;D Beyond!

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:36.651
MATT: Sam?

00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:45.833
SAM: Yes. D&amp;amp;D Beyond tonight, guys, sent a lot of
talking points. This is not a-- I'm happy. I'm

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:55.250
happy to honor our sponsor and read all of these
talking points, but it's a lot. So I'm not going

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.579
to really do a bit as much as just read them. I
had to spice it up a little bit. You guys all know

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.256
that I'm a master of impersonations and
impressions and I thought, who better to

00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:11.252
impersonate than the people right here at this
table? So I won't be reading these talking points.

00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:14.942
Maybe Matt will!

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.599
LIAM: You typed this right in front of me!

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:26.449
SAM: Pax Unplugged is this-- I can't see! I didn't
rehearse this! Pax Unplugged this weekend-- fuck!

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:31.990
Pax Unplugged is this weekend, and D&amp;amp;D Beyond will
be there. So bring your siggles and long flowing

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.406
hair because D&amp;amp;D Beyond will have tables set up
outside of the Adventurers League gameplay area.

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:42.690
Come and say hi! Oh, but take it away, Travis!

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.039
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:52.748
SAM: I love sports games! And guess what? D&amp;amp;D
Beyond will be running a roleplaying roulette one

00:01:52.748 --> 00:02:05.063
shot on the Pax main stage, which is kind of like
football, hyuck hyuck! Marisha says, so like--

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:12.193
sorry. I don't have a good Marisha. So like, you
can get more information about the one shot on

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:21.140
unplugged.paxsite.com or whatever. I'm cool, I
guess. It's weird being next to all these old guys

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.096
from like the 80s or whatever.

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:28.212
MARISHA: I'll let that one fly, yeah.

00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:29.337
SAM: Liam will take over.

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:31.213
ALL: Whoa!

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:32.860
LIAM: Time travel!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.730
SAM: I can't read this!

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.876
TRAVIS: I'll remember this, Liam.

00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:41.883
SAM: The one shot game description is: Want to
know what happens when a group of D&amp;amp;D luminaries

00:02:41.883 --> 00:02:48.376
come together to play completely random
characters? So do we. Come join the fun as players

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:54.305
create characters at the table during the event,
using D&amp;amp;D Beyond's randomize feature to improvise

00:02:54.305 --> 00:03:00.522
their way through a classic Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons
adventure. The event will be from 1:30 to 2:30

00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:11.954
Eastern Time on Saturday. Aah! Next, and look,
it's Sam Riegel! Hey, look at me, I need constant

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:22.653
attention! Also, D&amp;amp;D Beyond launched their new
show, Heroes of the Vale, this week! Join DM Mike

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:29.696
Mearls, with players T.J. Storm, Todd Kenreck,
Shelly Mazzanoble, and more in this new show set

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:36.556
in the Nentir Vale! I'm an egomaniac! Laura has to
add on to that--

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:37.618
LAURA: Oh god.

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:39.474
MARISHA: Oh god, why?

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:45.992
SAM: Oh, check out Heroes of the Vale-- why would
she be British? Check out Heroes of the Vale every

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:57.528
Wednesday at 2pm Pacific on twitch.tv/dndbeyond,
and follow @DnDBeyond for more info. My dice

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:02.309
addiction is becoming a problem! Finally, last but
not least, Taliesin says--

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.750
TALIESIN: Bring it. I'm excited.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.098
(cheering)

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:14.522
SAM: He says, Non bagno te, bagno il tuo cuore,
che sempre piÃº tu mi possa amare. Semper parere

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:19.985
D&amp;amp;D Beyond! He's a crazy figure from Greek
legend!

00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:22.847
TALIESIN: I have gained so much weight since that
picture, good lord.

00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:25.236
SAM: I hope that some of that was--

00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:29.733
MATT: Wow. Thank you, Sam.

00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:34.416
SAM: We'll also post this in text form somewhere
because I don't think anyone was listening.

00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:36.348
TRAVIS: There is some good stuff in there. We'll
find a way.

00:04:36.348 --> 00:04:37.766
SAM: There is great stuff and you should check it
out.

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:42.962
MATT: The Heroes of the Vale thing is actually--
well, that's friend of the show, T.J. Storm. Todd

00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:47.968
Kenreck also. Mearls is amazing. I've had the
opportunity to play with him a couple times, and

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.007
he's a fantastic DM. Super excited they're
actually putting that show together.

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:54.111
SAM: Check them out at Pax Unplugged this
weekend.

00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:57.815
MATT: Yes. Oh, and Shelly's in there too. That's
right. Awesome. Check that out. All right. Thank

00:04:57.815 --> 00:04:58.917
you, Sam.

00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:00.124
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:05:00.124 --> 00:05:07.332
MATT: Also, while we're on the topic of Sam, you
can check out Sam's recent fireside chat we had

00:05:07.332 --> 00:05:08.854
earlier this week.

00:05:08.854 --> 00:05:10.090
TRAVIS: And his thighs.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.315
MATT: He did have his thighs. It was unlocked
because of your guys' fantastic contributions to

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:19.383
Pablove's charity that we ran this past month or
two ago. You can check it out now at

00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:24.135
youtube.com/criticalrole. Through the month of
November, we're still raising money for Travis'

00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:27.104
favorite charity, Operation Supply Drop.

00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:30.794
TRAVIS: Operation Supply Drop! Yes. Operation
Supply Drop supports military members and their

00:05:30.794 --> 00:05:35.080
families-- active duty and veterans-- and their
transition back into civilian life. They are a

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.397
fantastic charity. Love to all of our brothers and
sisters in the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, US

00:05:41.397 --> 00:05:45.275
Coast Guard, all of the branches. We've got so
much love for you guys. We have already reached

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:50.517
our goal, but you still have time to donate. You
can get all of the details at critrole.com/osd.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:57.279
Very soon we will have a first-person shooter with
me either doing very well or really sucking and

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:03.326
screaming like a little girl. Please donate,
share, tell your friends and family. It's almost

00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:07.965
the end of November and giving love to all of our
brothers and sisters in the armed forces.

00:06:07.965 --> 00:06:09.058
MATT: Thank you for that.

00:06:09.058 --> 00:06:10.474
SAM: Woo, Travis!

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.888
MATT: Another fun thing. We've teamed up with our
good friend, Patrick Rothfuss, and his fantastic

00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:21.111
charity, Worldbuilders, to create a special set of
Vox Machina single-use buff cards that can be used

00:06:21.186 --> 00:06:24.960
for your own home games. I ask all you dungeon
masters out there, if one of your players brings

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.698
one of these to the table, to the best of your
ability, please allow the one use the card allows

00:06:29.698 --> 00:06:33.887
because, if not, you hate charitable things, and
you're a terrible person. They paid good money to

00:06:33.887 --> 00:06:40.204
help good people to use these cards. If your DM
won't let you, you let me know.

00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:42.944
ALL: Whoa.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.157
LAURA: Roll an intimidation check.

00:06:45.157 --> 00:06:47.827
TALIESIN: Does the DM get to keep the ticket if
you spend it? Is the question.

00:06:47.827 --> 00:06:50.480
MATT: An eight. That's on par for me, I think.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.317
TRAVIS: Not higher than 15.

00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:54.836
MATT: Not high enough for me. I'm not an
intimidating sort.

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:57.730
MARISHA: You lead with your heart.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:04.434
MATT: Yeah. Persuasion I can do. For an example,
we have the Grog card, where a player of any

00:07:04.434 --> 00:07:10.846
character can rage once during a combat,
regardless of their class, as you want to.

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:12.324
TRAVIS: (as Grog) Yeah, you've got a rage.

00:07:12.394 --> 00:07:16.286
MATT: Or we have the Vex card, allows you a
charisma boost to a persuasion check because you

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:20.581
wink, and it improves it dramatically. For every
$10 you donate, you'll be entered to win one of

00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:26.121
these cards. All proceeds go to the Heifer
Foundation, who provide long-term solutions for

00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:30.977
people in need in ways that help those individuals
prosper and in turn support their communities. For

00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:43.645
more info, and to donate and be a part of this,
check out http://bit.ly/wbdnd. One more time, you

00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:47.623
can put in bit.ly/wbdnd.

00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:49.441
TRAVIS: W-B-D-N-D.

00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:50.868
TALIESIN: Wih-bih-dib-n-dum.

00:07:50.868 --> 00:07:58.756
MATT: Exactly. Excited to be working with Patrick
on that. I think you had another announcement. Do

00:07:58.756 --> 00:08:00.240
you want to make it for us?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.311
LAURA: Oh, I do! Look at the store on Monday.
There's going to be some stuff going up!

00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:07.817
MARISHA: What stuff?

00:08:07.817 --> 00:08:12.935
LAURA: There's some stuff, but this is one of
them! I wanted to tease you guys. Oh, it's our

00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:24.483
official Tusk Love notebook, with art lovingly
done by @OrcBarbies on Twitter. Yeah. I am in love

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:25.479
with this.

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:26.988
MARISHA: So good.

00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:31.151
LAURA: So in love with this. Carry around your own
fabulous romance novel! Then make your own notes in it.

00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:33.289
SAM: That is so cool.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.407
MATT: The author's pretty cool too.

00:08:34.407 --> 00:08:35.515
SAM: Is that Jester on the cover?

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.376
LAURA: Of course it is!

00:08:36.376 --> 00:08:37.379
TRAVIS: Who's the gentleman?

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:42.316
LAURA: A beautiful Oskar. Oskar and Jester!

00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:44.646
SAM: Wait, who does it say it was written by?

00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:48.165
LAURA: It says it was written by Matilda
Merceria!

00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:50.736
SAM: That's his pen name.

00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:52.370
LAURA: Yeah.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.867
LIAM: I love it.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.620
MATT: Well, thank you for that. Excited to see
that go up.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.868
LAURA: I might use that tonight.

00:08:58.868 --> 00:09:04.018
MATT: I think that's all we have for our
announcements, so with that, my friends--

00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:06.537
ALL: No!

00:09:06.537 --> 00:09:11.129
MATT: Let's jump in to tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.877
[TV static, click]

00:09:15.877 --> 00:10:33.127
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:33.909 --> 00:10:35.978
MATT: Welcome back, everyone.

00:10:35.978 --> 00:10:38.158
TRAVIS: Just your mouth. Just your mouth. You had
two noses.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:44.856
MATT: Oh, I had two noses? There we go. That's
much better. Thank you, Sam, for that nightmare fuel.

00:10:44.856 --> 00:10:45.969
LAURA: Why do I have so many teeth?

00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:48.017
SAM: I thought it would look weird.

00:10:48.456 --> 00:10:57.230
MATT: All right. Last we left off, the Mighty Nein
had allied themselves with Captain Avantika of the

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:03.378
Squalleater, a pirate making her way through the
Swavain Islands in search of ways to unlock this

00:11:03.378 --> 00:11:09.871
entity that she was fanatically obsessed with,
this Uk'otoa, which was revealed to be the patron

00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:19.187
to Fjord's abilities. After retrieving one of
these sought-after orbs from this long-reused

00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:25.672
temple by the snake folk on the island, and
apparently unlocking one of these seals, you made

00:11:25.672 --> 00:11:31.978
your way back to Darktow on her ship, did a bit of
piracy. Arrived, were introduced to the Plank

00:11:31.978 --> 00:11:39.901
King, who looks over the Revelry, the band of
pirates that helm this side, pardon me, of the

00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:47.553
Lucidian Ocean. You then decided to have a plan to
break into the Squalleater at night while everyone

00:11:47.553 --> 00:11:53.070
was at rest, or some of you at rest. Some were
distracting the captain. In doing so, you managed

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:59.387
to uncover a well-hidden journal of Avantika that
was written in some sort of a cipher.

00:11:59.387 --> 00:12:00.456
LAURA: Kind of like the journal?

00:12:00.456 --> 00:12:07.440
MATT: Kind of like the journal. Didn't quite look
like that, but artistic interpretation. Your

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:17.931
entrance was solid. Your exit left a couple of
signs of disturbance, but nothing implicating. You

00:12:17.931 --> 00:12:23.971
returned, and through the evening and the luck of
a ridiculous roll, you managed to, via Caleb,

00:12:23.971 --> 00:12:30.575
break the cipher on it, after knowing what
information was there through your spell, and

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:36.973
write a cipher to allow anybody to read the
contents of this journal and see what's within.

00:12:36.973 --> 00:12:43.682
However, the morning in which you awoke, you
discovered that the crew, at least, had seemed to

00:12:43.682 --> 00:12:49.754
have noticed all these strange events through the
night. The ransacked chamber pointed to some

00:12:49.754 --> 00:12:57.601
tomfoolery. You were all asked to make your way to
the shipyard to meet with Avantika and the crew on

00:12:57.601 --> 00:13:04.878
the Squalleater. With not far behind you on the
docks the rest of the crew of the Mistake being

00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:12.922
brought as well. Upon you stepping up and
encountering this moment of tension, it seems

00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:22.929
that, through Vera's glance through some form of
divination magic, while some people have guarding

00:13:22.929 --> 00:13:31.032
objects or items against themselves being sought
through divination, certain objects in pockets are

00:13:31.032 --> 00:13:39.147
not free of it. They glanced over in Caleb's
direction, and in that moment, you cast Wall of

00:13:39.147 --> 00:13:49.280
Fire. Before we get too far into this, I need you
to place your Wall of Fire for me, please, on this battlefield.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.049
TRAVIS: Take your time, take your time.

00:13:51.049 --> 00:13:52.945
SAM: What can it do? Can it go up things?

00:13:52.945 --> 00:14:02.034
LIAM: 20 feet tall. I can choose which side the
wall burns, 10-feet reach, and which side does not.

00:14:02.034 --> 00:14:04.080
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. That's good.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.410
SAM: This is going to be hard on the boat.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.877
TRAVIS: Take your time, take your time. The longer
you take--

00:14:07.877 --> 00:14:09.815
LIAM: This table can't bear my weight.

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:14.122
LAURA: It can too, because we all got on the table
for Sam's one shot.

00:14:14.122 --> 00:14:16.487
SAM: Now available on YouTube, guys.

00:14:16.487 --> 00:14:23.250
MATT: Okay, while you're doing this, I'm going to
put this up there, now the announcements are complete.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.125
LIAM: I don't know how I would make it go on an
angle without causing problems.

00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.356
TRAVIS: We'll just assume it covers that, right?
Yeah.

00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:32.324
MATT: Yeah, best you can.

00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:33.980
LIAM: Best I can.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.667
TALIESIN: Oh sweet Jesus.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.956
MATT: Oh, you're creating a U?

00:14:37.956 --> 00:14:39.045
SAM: Is that possible?

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:42.555
LIAM: Well, this isn't what I imagined in my head,
but we are standing where we are standing, so I'm

00:14:42.555 --> 00:14:43.815
going with what I see.

00:14:43.815 --> 00:14:44.548
MATT: Okay.

00:14:44.548 --> 00:14:46.365
TRAVIS: Yeah. I dig it.

00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:52.338
LIAM: Okay, I want that to go like that, but it's
not going.

00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:54.269
SAM: The whole show is just this.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.471
MATT: This is it. This is the entire thing.

00:14:55.471 --> 00:14:56.372
LAURA: Oh my lord.

00:14:56.372 --> 00:14:57.891
TRAVIS: It's actually really cool looking.

00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:02.110
LIAM: I would like the last one to be on this
gentleman.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.889
MATT: Okay. We'll place it here.

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:09.462
LIAM: Leaving room to get to this gangway, but
he's burning and that's going like this.

00:15:09.462 --> 00:15:10.685
MATT: We'll say that he is currently--

00:15:10.685 --> 00:15:10.953
SAM: Ablaze.

00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:18.985
LIAM: Facing this to there, also allowing access
to both the gangplanks--

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:25.425
(clattering, laughter)

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.311
MATT: That was amazing.

00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:30.033
TRAVIS: That was the best thing that could have
happened!

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:35.057
MATT: All righty. Meticulous placement be damned.

00:15:35.057 --> 00:15:37.572
TALIESIN: Someone's getting Velcro in their
stocking.

00:15:37.572 --> 00:15:38.659
MATT: Yeah.

00:15:38.659 --> 00:15:40.845
LIAM: I can't make them stick, man!

00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:47.578
MATT: It's fine. Liam, leave it. Leave it alone!
You've lost miniature privileges.

00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:52.276
TRAVIS: He was there too. He was there.

00:15:52.276 --> 00:15:57.677
MATT: In the final moment-- we lost one of them up
top, too.

00:15:57.677 --> 00:16:04.735
LIAM: Fucking real D&amp;amp;D, people. It went better in
rehearsal.

00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:09.384
MATT: Sure. That'll do.

00:16:09.384 --> 00:16:12.533
LIAM: We all know-- I'm not going to touch it--
the gangplanks are open.

00:16:12.533 --> 00:16:14.838
SAM: We lost a guy on top. Wasn't there a guy on
top?

00:16:14.838 --> 00:16:16.468
TRAVIS: He's right here behind Avantika.

00:16:16.468 --> 00:16:18.447
LIAM: That's right. He's just out of your line of
sight.

00:16:18.447 --> 00:16:30.638
MATT: Perfect. Now meticulously, carefully placed
to not waste anyone's time. At that moment, you

00:16:30.638 --> 00:16:36.894
all, noticing this moment of tension, there's a
flash from Caleb's hands. Figures, their eyes dart

00:16:36.894 --> 00:16:44.126
in his direction as he finishes releasing his arms
and firing out of the actual deck of the ship, you

00:16:44.126 --> 00:16:51.739
see a 20-foot tall high wall of roaring flame and
fire burn around in a U-shape encompassing the

00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:55.628
exterior. You can feel the heat on you, but it's
not so intense as to hurt. However, I need you to

00:16:55.628 --> 00:16:57.787
roll damage.

00:16:57.787 --> 00:16:59.799
LIAM: It's a ten-foot reach on the outside of this
thing.

00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:02.979
MATT: Correct. That's 5d8 fire damage, if you
don't mind.

00:17:02.979 --> 00:17:04.639
TRAVIS: On the burn side?

00:17:04.639 --> 00:17:08.725
LIAM: On the outside. I choose the side, so
clearly I'm not going to burn us.

00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:11.681
TRAVIS: Anyone within ten feet of the outside gets
5d8?

00:17:11.681 --> 00:17:14.614
MARISHA: That's fucking rad. Kill some bitches.

00:17:14.614 --> 00:17:17.948
TRAVIS: I don't know why I didn't expect it to be
that amazing.

00:17:17.948 --> 00:17:22.264
LIAM: Shit! Bad rolls. 17 total.

00:17:22.264 --> 00:17:25.735
SAM: That's fine. That's a good start.

00:17:25.735 --> 00:17:31.631
MATT: That's a success for the dwarf over there.
He takes--

00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:34.059
LIAM: A one, a two, and a three were the first
three rolls.

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:40.745
MATT: That's a shame. Eight damage for him. For
Bouldergut, that is a failure.

00:17:40.745 --> 00:17:45.196
LIAM: Also to toss out: the flames are opaque, so
they cannot be seen through.

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:54.036
MATT: Mm-hmm. 17 for Bouldergut. To the guy it got
put on directly, that's a failure on his point. He

00:17:54.036 --> 00:17:59.650
takes a full 17 points of damage. The guy who's
guarding the other plank there, that's a failure

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:09.339
on him. He takes 17. Avantika fails with a natural
one. Avantika takes a full 17. Then we have the

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:17.768
guy over there. He fails with a three. He takes
another 17. Then Vera rolls a natural 20. Vera's

00:18:17.768 --> 00:18:25.283
right there. Vera takes eight. Now that the Wall
of Fire is in place, crackling around you,

00:18:25.283 --> 00:18:31.287
blackening the surface of the deck, the roaring of
its sound as it (whooshing), roll initiative, please.

00:18:31.287 --> 00:18:35.997
TRAVIS: Advantage for Yasha.

00:18:35.997 --> 00:18:45.591
MATT: I pre-rolled initiative for the guys here to
keep it going. 25 to 20?

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:50.623
MARISHA: Hang on. 24.

00:18:50.623 --> 00:18:59.479
MATT: All right. 20 to 15, anybody?

00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:01.803
TRAVIS: Yasha has a 15.

00:19:01.803 --> 00:19:03.623
LAURA: Oh, I'm 19.

00:19:03.623 --> 00:19:06.883
MATT: We have Jester and Yasha.

00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:08.724
LAURA: Wait. Beau, Jester, Yasha?

00:19:08.724 --> 00:19:09.713
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:19:09.713 --> 00:19:12.201
SAM: That's great.

00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:13.440
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.672
TALIESIN: 12.

00:19:14.672 --> 00:19:19.108
TRAVIS: 11 for Fjord.

00:19:19.108 --> 00:19:20.424
MATT: Fjord at 11.

00:19:20.424 --> 00:19:23.216
TALIESIN: 12.

00:19:23.216 --> 00:19:28.161
TRAVIS: Beau, Jester, Yasha, Caduceus, Fjord.

00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:29.424
MATT: All right. Ten to five?

00:19:29.424 --> 00:19:30.985
LIAM: Eight.

00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:37.976
TRAVIS: How do you spell your name, Caleb? That's
right.

00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:41.013
LAURA: I'm so nervous! What are our names?

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:46.183
SAM: Oh, shoot! I'm a nine. I didn't say, sorry.

00:19:46.183 --> 00:19:49.127
LAURA: You're above Caleb. Thanks for fucking up
everyone's list.

00:19:49.127 --> 00:19:51.531
SAM: Sorry. I'm nervous, guys!

00:19:51.531 --> 00:19:55.873
MATT: That's all right. Top of the combat round,
as the flames are crackling around, you hear

00:19:55.873 --> 00:20:00.554
screams from crewmen that are too close and having
to pull back and someone starts shouting "Fire!"

00:20:00.554 --> 00:20:05.321
off to the side, from this side of the docks.
Beau, you're up first. What are you doing?

00:20:05.321 --> 00:20:06.847
TRAVIS: I can see your pulse in your neck.

00:20:06.847 --> 00:20:18.884
MARISHA: Can you? I'm dying! I might be having a
heart attack! Beau reaches around, and scuffles

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:22.793
around to Caleb and goes: Give me the notebook!
I'm sticking with the plan!

00:20:22.793 --> 00:20:24.776
SAM: Okay!

00:20:24.776 --> 00:20:26.613
LAURA: Are you going to grab it from him?

00:20:26.613 --> 00:20:28.864
MARISHA: Yes! I'm going to grab it from you.

00:20:28.864 --> 00:20:34.908
LIAM: Okay. It's wedged into my belt. Yeah, okay.

00:20:34.908 --> 00:20:39.791
MARISHA: Then I look at Jester.

00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:42.856
TRAVIS: This is the most precarious Operation game
ever.

00:20:42.856 --> 00:20:45.575
MATT: Isn't it, though? That's fine. That'll
work.

00:20:45.575 --> 00:20:48.902
MARISHA: I can't hold a movement, right?

00:20:48.902 --> 00:20:51.233
MATT: No. Only an action.

00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:53.527
MARISHA: Was taking the book an action?

00:20:53.527 --> 00:20:58.534
MATT: I'll say running up to him and then going,
"Give me the book," him rummaging through it or

00:20:58.534 --> 00:21:01.920
you helping him rummage through and grab it? I'll
consider that an action because that takes a few

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:09.983
seconds to do. It's not something he had ready.
You've moved 15 feet to get over there and then

00:21:09.983 --> 00:21:11.044
your action.

00:21:11.044 --> 00:21:12.781
MARISHA: How far away is Jester from me now?

00:21:12.781 --> 00:21:15.505
MATT: Jester was right next to you when you
started.

00:21:15.505 --> 00:21:17.696
MARISHA: I run back to Jester.

00:21:17.696 --> 00:21:21.737
MATT: That's another 15 feet. That's 30 foot of
your movement.

00:21:21.737 --> 00:21:24.460
MARISHA: I say: Let's get out of here.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.626
LAURA: Okay.

00:21:25.626 --> 00:21:28.289
MARISHA: That's my turn.

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:32.019
MATT: Okay. That finishes Beau's go. Avantika's up
next.

00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:38.380
MARISHA: Oh, I could have done Patient Defense! I
should have done it!

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.237
TRAVIS: She can't see in here, I think.

00:21:40.237 --> 00:21:44.937
MATT: She cannot see, but what she can do is
Control Water.

00:21:44.937 --> 00:21:47.213
SAM: Oh!

00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:53.109
MATT: Seeing this flames happen, she (groans),
pulls back, closes her eyes for a second, and

00:21:53.109 --> 00:22:00.033
raises her scarred hand where the sphere that she
unlocked Uk'otoa with raised up. At that point,

00:22:00.033 --> 00:22:03.526
the water from the ocean begins to rise--

00:22:03.526 --> 00:22:05.477
LIAM: Counterspell.

00:22:06.896 --> 00:22:11.094
MATT: All right. It's a 4th-level spell, so I need
you to roll.

00:22:11.094 --> 00:22:14.588
LIAM: I know, and it's at disadvantage. (gasps)

00:22:14.588 --> 00:22:16.596
MARISHA: What did you get?!

00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:19.057
LIAM: I rolled a 14 and a 19! She fails!

00:22:19.057 --> 00:22:20.121
MATT: She does!

00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:24.931
(cheering and laughter)

00:22:24.931 --> 00:22:28.565
TRAVIS: Look at the veins! Oh my god!

00:22:30.825 --> 00:22:34.268
SAM: That was two weeks of tension being
released.

00:22:34.268 --> 00:22:38.180
TRAVIS: Orgasms all under the table right now!

00:22:38.526 --> 00:22:46.988
MATT: Holy shit! You watch as the ocean begins to
swell upwards. Avantika raises her arm-- but you

00:22:46.988 --> 00:22:51.337
said the walls are opaque. Can you see through the
walls?

00:22:51.337 --> 00:22:54.190
LIAM: Can I hear her go (arcane chanting)?

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.615
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:22:55.615 --> 00:22:57.220
(groaning)

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.982
SAM: This is a fair point.

00:22:58.982 --> 00:23:12.183
LIAM: Oh, natural 20 and a 16, plus perception--
The lowest roll was a 19.

00:23:12.183 --> 00:23:14.312
LAURA: I like that you don't know where your
perception is right now.

00:23:14.312 --> 00:23:15.258
LIAM: I never do.

00:23:15.258 --> 00:23:19.825
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't require you to have seen
the person. You know the spell's happening, you

00:23:19.825 --> 00:23:26.083
know the direction of the person. You rolled a
high enough perception. I'll allow it. As you hear

00:23:26.083 --> 00:23:30.745
her chanting beneath her breath and you hear the
wave rising, you glance over in the direction and

00:23:30.745 --> 00:23:37.935
you, having an instinctual affinity with flames
and fire, can barely see the darkened shape of her

00:23:37.935 --> 00:23:43.006
on the opposite side of the flames being warped by
the light. Using that moment, you put your hand

00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:48.374
forward and release the destructive pattern of
your Counterspell. With that, the swelling ocean

00:23:48.374 --> 00:23:50.766
splatters back down to the surface.

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:56.241
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Now you can die happy.

00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:05.209
MATT: As that happens you hear her go, "Merde!"
and she begins to back up over to here onto the

00:24:05.209 --> 00:24:11.938
side and starts shouting, "Vera!" That's going to
end her turn, because that was her action.

00:24:11.938 --> 00:24:13.505
TRAVIS: I wonder how many times she can do that.

00:24:13.505 --> 00:24:14.326
MATT: Jester.

00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:25.776
LAURA: Okay. I remember we went to the Plank King
and we took the path to get to him. How far away

00:24:25.776 --> 00:24:28.933
is the base of his mountain? His stairs?

00:24:28.933 --> 00:24:35.825
MATT: From where you are right now? It's probably
somewhere between 1200 and 1500 feet, maybe?

00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:41.107
LAURA: Okay. Can I get 500 feet on the path to
there with Dimension Door? I grab Beau around the

00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:49.313
waist and say: Come with me! I cast Dimension
Door. Ten feet above the ground. I say: Get ready

00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:52.636
to land! So I don't land on a person.

00:24:52.636 --> 00:24:56.297
MARISHA: So considerate of you.

00:24:56.297 --> 00:25:02.256
TALIESIN: Wow, this is a look.

00:25:02.256 --> 00:25:18.283
MATT: Beau and Jester vanish from sight in a puff
of purplish-pink smoke. They both are gone. That's

00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:19.359
your action.

00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:20.104
LAURA: Yes.

00:25:20.104 --> 00:25:26.301
MATT: You suddenly find yourself appearing in the
center of the cobblestone street, with The Bloated

00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:30.612
Cup maybe about two or three blocks up that way on
the familiar path you know that you took, hooking

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:34.298
around the side that led you to the Throne Roost.

00:25:34.298 --> 00:25:35.378
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:36.393
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:25:36.393 --> 00:25:45.765
MATT: You also do notice now that there are some
folks and some of The Revelry watch that are now

00:25:45.765 --> 00:25:51.361
glancing over at the very bright inferno that is
this beacon of flame over there in the shipyard.

00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:55.345
You appear out of nowhere and there's two of them
that look over in your direction, noticing you

00:25:55.345 --> 00:26:00.622
appear. That's all. That's all that happens. You
still have your movement and your bonus.

00:26:00.622 --> 00:26:09.251
LAURA: I'm going to start moving towards-- yeah?
Okay. I start moving towards the Plank King.

00:26:09.251 --> 00:26:10.532
MARISHA: I'll catch up with you.

00:26:10.532 --> 00:26:14.882
MATT: Okay. Good to know. That finishes Jester's
go. Yasha's up.

00:26:14.882 --> 00:26:22.856
TRAVIS: Yasha. What is she doing again? Wow, my
brain is so scrambled.

00:26:22.856 --> 00:26:25.728
TALIESIN: I know, it's hard to think right now.

00:26:25.728 --> 00:26:29.105
MATT: You're down two party members in the middle
of a U of flames.

00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:36.150
TRAVIS: Yeah. She's over here, right? Is this her?
Okay.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.476
MATT: That's two hours of online research about
Control Water and Wall of Fire and interactions

00:26:39.476 --> 00:26:42.461
completely mute. That is awesome.

00:26:42.461 --> 00:26:47.732
LIAM and MATT: Good game.

00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:50.049
TRAVIS: We're getting the fuck out, right?

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:51.461
MATT: What are you doing, Yasha?

00:26:51.461 --> 00:27:03.053
TRAVIS: Yasha is going to use her movement to run
off. She would like to-- Is she raging?

00:27:03.053 --> 00:27:07.145
MATT: If she doesn't make an attack and isn't
attacked, she loses her rage.

00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:12.223
TRAVIS: She will use her movement to head towards
the side of the ship and try to exit the craft,

00:27:12.223 --> 00:27:14.014
and let's see how far we get.

00:27:14.088 --> 00:27:22.854
MATT: Okay. She scoots by the one guy who's
currently-- so that'd be (counting) 35 right there.

00:27:22.854 --> 00:27:24.336
TRAVIS: And 40 is her speed.

00:27:24.336 --> 00:27:29.226
MATT: So she can get there. As she swings by, the
one guy that's currently in the wall of fire is

00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:32.336
like, "Shit!" He glances out of the corner of his
eye and sees her go by and he gets one attack of

00:27:32.336 --> 00:27:42.738
opportunity swinging at her as she streaks through
the space. That's going to be a 15 to hit.

00:27:42.738 --> 00:27:44.498
TRAVIS: Ugh, it hits.

00:27:44.498 --> 00:27:52.736
MATT: Okay. In an errant backhand swing-- she's
got meaty hit points, though. That's going to be

00:27:52.736 --> 00:27:56.799
eight points of slashing damage to Yasha as she
rushes past.

00:27:56.799 --> 00:28:02.783
TRAVIS: Great. She will use her bonus action to
rage.

00:28:02.783 --> 00:28:03.605
MATT: Okay.

00:28:03.605 --> 00:28:05.831
TRAVIS: Yep. That will be her turn.

00:28:05.831 --> 00:28:08.534
MATT: She's not going to do anything with her
action? She can dash with her action and move

00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:09.633
again if you're trying to get her to move.

00:28:09.633 --> 00:28:16.870
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, double dash. Yeah, I'm sorry. A
little frazzled.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.085
MATT: 40. What's her movement?

00:28:18.085 --> 00:28:20.375
TRAVIS: 40 and bonus to rage.

00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:28.876
MATT: All right. As she charges past, that guard
sees her running and goes, "Wait!" There's a huge

00:28:28.876 --> 00:28:32.508
distraction now. This person here who saw all of a
sudden the flames erupt who was part of Avantika's

00:28:32.508 --> 00:28:36.554
crew, one of the crew members, is going to take an
attack of opportunity at her as well as she runs

00:28:36.554 --> 00:28:40.974
past. She is raging, though, so she takes half
damage. Ooh, that's going to be a 21 to hit.

00:28:40.974 --> 00:28:42.374
TRAVIS: Hits.

00:28:42.374 --> 00:28:47.283
MATT: She takes another eight damage, but it's
reduced to four. That finishes Yasha's go.

00:28:47.283 --> 00:28:48.893
Caduceus, you're up.

00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:53.882
TALIESIN: Okay. I just saw that we are running,
apparently.

00:28:53.882 --> 00:29:01.153
MATT: You see Yasha run past you. You look over
and you watch as Beau and Jester (blink). They're gone.

00:29:01.153 --> 00:29:10.934
TALIESIN: Well, okay. Let's see. I'm going to
follow Yasha, because that's apparently the way--

00:29:10.987 --> 00:29:13.890
how much distance can I cover? How close to her
can I get?

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.224
MATT: We'll find out. Movement 30 if you're
rushing past her.

00:29:17.224 --> 00:29:20.601
TALIESIN: Is there an easier way off or is that
the easiest way off the boat?

00:29:20.601 --> 00:29:25.074
MATT: There are three ways off the boat. There's
either this gangplank, which is closer to you,

00:29:25.074 --> 00:29:29.014
this gangplank, which is further from you but
generally will meet the same distance, or jumping

00:29:29.014 --> 00:29:30.263
in the water.

00:29:30.263 --> 00:29:33.823
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Whichever way gets me closer to
her quickly.

00:29:33.823 --> 00:29:35.402
TRAVIS: You're such a fan of the water, though,
Taliesin.

00:29:35.402 --> 00:29:37.503
TALIESIN: I'm learning.

00:29:37.503 --> 00:29:42.902
MATT: (counting) 30 gets you halfway on the plank
there.

00:29:42.902 --> 00:29:49.961
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll take that other 30 for now,
then.

00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:55.381
MATT: (counting) 30. You're right behind Yasha.
That character does not get an attack of

00:29:55.381 --> 00:30:02.468
opportunity on you because they already used their
reaction to hit Yasha.

00:30:02.468 --> 00:30:09.788
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to hold there for now.

00:30:09.837 --> 00:30:14.570
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn. Now it's
Fjord. Aside from Avantika, the rest of them

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.573
rolled piss-poor initiative, which is to your
advantage.

00:30:17.573 --> 00:30:25.640
TRAVIS: Okay. Fjord is going to-- Am I standing
right next to Caleb?

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.201
MATT: You are currently, yes. As far as Wall of
Fire goes, I'm checking the damage on that, is

00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:31.650
that at the top of their turn?

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.139
LIAM: Are you asking-- Oh you're asking me.

00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:34.732
MATT: Oh, at the end of each turn.

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:37.571
LIAM: If they end their turn or the first time it
hits them...

00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:42.208
MATT: First time they enter it. Got you, okay,
good to know. So if they don't leave that area--

00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:45.501
LIAM: When it enters the wall for the first time
on a turn or ends its turn there.

00:30:45.501 --> 00:30:47.967
MATT: Got you. All right, cool. Thank you.

00:30:47.967 --> 00:30:53.740
TRAVIS: I am going to use my movement to make sure
that I walk up and put a hand on Caleb's shoulder.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:31:00.159
I'm going to hold Thunder Step until Nott moves.

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:02.212
MATT: You are going to begin casting Thunder
Step...

00:31:02.212 --> 00:31:04.152
TRAVIS: But look at Nott and wait.

00:31:04.152 --> 00:31:05.191
MATT: You're readying it as a spell?

00:31:05.191 --> 00:31:07.311
TRAVIS: Readying it as a spell, yeah. The second
he moves--

00:31:07.311 --> 00:31:11.833
MATT: To trigger the instant Nott moves. You've
got it. Okay.

00:31:11.833 --> 00:31:14.052
LIAM: Moves or clears the--

00:31:14.052 --> 00:31:17.322
TRAVIS: If he moves, yeah.

00:31:17.322 --> 00:31:23.972
MATT: Got you. He said moves. All right, that
finishes your go, now it's Bouldergut's turn.

00:31:23.972 --> 00:31:31.800
Bouldergut, angry about the flames goes (angry
groan). Looking aback, batting at them a little

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:39.330
bit with her arm, goes and steps through the wall.
She takes the damage again. Roll another 5d8. That

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.972
is going to step into the space where the flames
are no longer touching her and on the outside it's

00:31:44.972 --> 00:31:47.574
not burning.

00:31:47.574 --> 00:31:54.273
LIAM: 24 that time.

00:31:54.273 --> 00:31:57.821
MATT: Yeah, they don't get a saving throw by
walking through it. She takes your damage. What's

00:31:57.821 --> 00:31:58.632
the damage?

00:31:58.632 --> 00:31:59.833
LIAM: 24.

00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:05.820
MATT: Bouldergut comes through singed. You see it
as bits of her hair are curled up and red at the

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:11.799
tips from where elements of it have turned to
ember and takes a giant swing with her two-handed

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:14.121
great club at you.

00:32:14.121 --> 00:32:16.998
LIAM: That's going to hit.

00:32:16.998 --> 00:32:21.154
MATT: Yeah, that is. That's a 23 to hit.

00:32:21.154 --> 00:32:22.472
LIAM: Absolutely.

00:32:22.472 --> 00:32:32.873
MATT: All right, so with that, that's 15 points of
bludgeoning damage. Make a constitution save.

00:32:32.873 --> 00:32:34.609
LIAM: It's a ten right, because it's half.

00:32:34.609 --> 00:32:39.630
MATT: It's half or ten, whichever is higher. So,
constitution saving throw.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:40.890
LIAM: At disadvantage.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.511
MATT: Only ability checks are at disadvantage, not
saving throws.

00:32:42.511 --> 00:32:44.248
LIAM: Oh, saving throw? Well I rolled twice.

00:32:44.248 --> 00:32:46.081
MATT: Just roll one more time.

00:32:46.081 --> 00:32:48.569
LIAM: Straight, because they were both pretty
good. Natural 20.

00:32:48.569 --> 00:32:51.289
(relieved cheering)

00:32:51.289 --> 00:33:01.707
MATT: Fantastic. She swings with her second
attack. That is 19 to hit.

00:33:01.739 --> 00:33:03.088
LIAM: Hits, yeah.

00:33:03.088 --> 00:33:13.068
MATT: That-- Ooh. 17 points of damage. Another
DC10, make another constitution saving throw.

00:33:13.068 --> 00:33:20.736
LIAM: That's balls. That is just a seven.

00:33:20.736 --> 00:33:30.240
MATT: The flames flicker out as your concentration
is abruptly broken by the ogre that stepped

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:42.046
through the fire wall and twice bashed-- Ford and
Caleb right there.

00:33:42.046 --> 00:33:44.525
SAM: All plans go wrong guys. It's okay, it's
okay.

00:33:44.525 --> 00:33:47.071
MARISHA: It's, you know-- We anticipated this.

00:33:47.071 --> 00:33:52.240
SAM: We've still got two clerics... somewhere in
the world.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:58.827
MATT: That ends Bouldergut's turn. Now that comes
to Nott and Vera going at the same time in the

00:33:58.827 --> 00:34:03.391
same initiative count. You have a higher dexterity
than Vera, so I'm letting you go first.

00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:11.410
SAM: Nott is going to stick with the plan and run
towards that gangplank and get out of dodge.

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:16.160
MATT: Five, ten, 15. You're triggering
your...

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.037
TRAVIS: Thunder Step.

00:34:17.037 --> 00:34:19.810
MATT: Thunder Step. 15. Are you going down the
gangplank?

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:27.491
SAM: Yeah, as soon as I crest it, when I get up
there, they're gone by that point, right?

00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:29.297
MATT: So, what do you do now? You do...

00:34:29.297 --> 00:34:31.718
TRAVIS: 3d10 damage and we--

00:34:31.718 --> 00:34:33.539
MATT: In what radius?

00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:34.726
TRAVIS: Within ten feet.

00:34:34.726 --> 00:34:42.686
MATT: Within ten feet? That will get Bouldergut.
It won't get anybody else. After slamming her club

00:34:42.686 --> 00:34:46.676
twice into Caleb, you're holding his shoulder as
the impact is causing him to nearly crumple

00:34:46.676 --> 00:34:51.898
against you. You lift him up under the arm right
as the spell finishes and (thunder crack).

00:34:51.898 --> 00:34:59.260
TRAVIS: 18 points of thunder damage and Caleb and
I will disappear and reappear 90 feet in the

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.062
direction of the base of the hill.

00:35:03.062 --> 00:35:11.098
MATT: You are over here. All right.

00:35:11.098 --> 00:35:12.519
SAM: Who's still on the ship?

00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:15.880
MATT: With a loud, heavy burst of thunder,
impacts--

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.137
SAM: It's just me now, right?

00:35:17.137 --> 00:35:22.537
MATT: Crackling through the air surrounding the
shipyard. With that, both Caleb and Fjord vanish

00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:28.577
and reappear across the distance, landing on the
creaking wood of the old rickety dock. Hearing the

00:35:28.577 --> 00:35:33.737
footsteps behind you of Caduceus and Yasha trying
to catch up, the guard all looking confused at

00:35:33.737 --> 00:35:39.537
what's transpiring, and a little ways down the way
you can see there's about five or six other guards

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:43.481
that are walking alongside the rest of the crew of
The Mistake that are all stopping and seeing

00:35:43.481 --> 00:35:48.489
what's going on here. That's the end of your go.
You still have 15 feet of movement.

00:35:48.489 --> 00:35:56.308
SAM: Yeah, I will-- Nott will continue to run down
that-- Sorry, no. She gets to the top of the

00:35:56.308 --> 00:36:00.957
gangplank, she's going to turn around and nail
Vera with a bolt.

00:36:00.957 --> 00:36:02.447
MATT: Okay.

00:36:02.447 --> 00:36:03.351
MARISHA: That's so punk rock.

00:36:03.351 --> 00:36:05.261
MATT: Roll for an attack.

00:36:05.261 --> 00:36:06.647
SAM: I don't think it's sneak attack or anything.

00:36:06.647 --> 00:36:07.846
MATT: It's not.

00:36:07.846 --> 00:36:11.448
SAM: It's only a 12. No, 14 to hit.

00:36:11.448 --> 00:36:16.416
MATT: 14? You needed a 15. Yeah, that Mage Armor
manages to deflect it.

00:36:16.416 --> 00:36:20.780
SAM: All right, well then I'll just keep running
down the plank and then use bonus action to dash

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.227
another 30 feet.

00:36:22.227 --> 00:36:36.697
MATT: All right, you're right before Yasha. With
that, Vera is going to take her turn. Vera steps

00:36:36.697 --> 00:36:46.218
up the side (counting) 30 and is now up on the top
of the ship glancing over as everyone charges

00:36:46.218 --> 00:36:55.187
past. She raises her arm, "Come, great serpent of
the sea!" and she raises her hand above and brings

00:36:55.187 --> 00:36:59.570
her fingers together into a fist as she brings it
down slowly like there's force against her fist.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:06.298
You watch as this white cloud begins to appear and
hailstone-like shards of ice begin to pelt down

00:37:06.298 --> 00:37:13.658
onto the dock below into this radius right here.
It does manage to get the guard as well.

00:37:13.658 --> 00:37:16.558
TALIESIN: I was going to say, they're going to hit
the guard.

00:37:16.558 --> 00:37:19.577
MARISHA: Good. Going to piss that guard off.

00:37:19.577 --> 00:37:29.028
MATT: What that does is it also turns this area
into rough terrain until the end of her next turn.

00:37:29.062 --> 00:37:32.786
He is there. You guys are all here.

00:37:32.786 --> 00:37:35.165
LIAM: Does the cloud remain in the sky?

00:37:35.165 --> 00:37:36.370
MATT: The cloud has vanished now.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.696
LIAM: Okay, so it was a one time.

00:37:37.696 --> 00:37:38.655
SAM: Okay.

00:37:38.655 --> 00:37:50.267
MATT: However, I need you all to make... Here we
go. It's an Ice Storm spell. Dexterity saving

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:55.369
throw from the three of you please. If you don't
mind.

00:37:55.369 --> 00:37:57.025
SAM: 19 for me.

00:37:57.025 --> 00:37:57.855
MATT: Success for you.

00:37:57.855 --> 00:37:59.105
TALIESIN: 20 for me.

00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:01.854
MATT: Success for you, and roll for Yasha as well
if you don't mind.

00:38:01.854 --> 00:38:03.716
TRAVIS: What am I rolling?

00:38:03.716 --> 00:38:04.986
ALL: Dexterity save.

00:38:04.986 --> 00:38:06.657
TRAVIS: She gets advantage on those.

00:38:06.657 --> 00:38:09.289
SAM: I've never seen Travis this nervous before.

00:38:09.289 --> 00:38:10.596
TRAVIS: I'm so flustered.

00:38:10.596 --> 00:38:14.395
TALIESIN: My heart is fucking racing right now. I
am not okay.

00:38:14.395 --> 00:38:16.371
TRAVIS: That's 11 for Yasha.

00:38:16.371 --> 00:38:23.483
MATT: Yasha fails. Yasha takes 22 points of cold
damage. That's 11 points to Caduceus and Nott.

00:38:23.483 --> 00:38:27.506
Although none to you because you succeeded and you
have evasion, so you take none.

00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:29.856
SAM: Is that how that works? Wow, cool!

00:38:29.856 --> 00:38:34.470
MATT: That's what rogues can do! Yeah, whenever
you have to make a dex save against an effect,

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:39.357
take half damage. If you succeed, you take no
damage. If you fail, you take half. You should

00:38:39.357 --> 00:38:40.766
read your character sheet.

00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:44.109
TRAVIS: Can I do fanatical focus?

00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.937
MATT: Yes you may.

00:38:44.937 --> 00:38:47.058
TRAVIS: I'm going to do the fanatical focus once
per day.

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.925
MATT: So you get to re-roll that. Once.

00:38:48.925 --> 00:38:50.550
TRAVIS: 19 plus two is 21.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.517
MATT: Okay, so she only takes 11. However
everything in this, for the next round, is

00:38:54.517 --> 00:38:58.404
difficult terrain as there's now giant hailstones
and sleet slicked all over the rickety docks.

00:38:58.404 --> 00:38:59.266
SAM: Is it half movement?

00:38:59.266 --> 00:38:59.849
MATT: Yes.

00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:01.525
SAM: Okay.

00:39:01.525 --> 00:39:07.365
MATT: That's going to end Vera's go. Now it comes
to Caleb.

00:39:07.365 --> 00:39:10.225
LIAM: Oh yeah, okay.

00:39:10.225 --> 00:39:11.227
MATT: Hanging over here on the side.

00:39:11.227 --> 00:39:15.828
LIAM: Are there any crates or anything around on
the dock that look lift-able from Catapult?

00:39:15.828 --> 00:39:17.725
MATT: There are two chests off to the side there.

00:39:17.725 --> 00:39:27.783
LIAM: Okay, if they look light enough, I will
throw one up into the air at Avantika's head.

00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:32.624
MATT: Okay, go for the roll on that.

00:39:32.624 --> 00:39:35.287
SAM: Throw ice?

00:39:35.287 --> 00:39:36.838
MATT: He's throwing one of the chests over here.

00:39:36.838 --> 00:39:38.310
SAM: Oh, one of the chests.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:47.566
LIAM: No. I am going instead to cast Expeditious
Retreat on myself and at the same time change the

00:39:47.566 --> 00:39:59.510
focus on my transmuter stone to a constitution
buff. That's it. I'm going to jet back 90 feet.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.994
SAM: 90 feet?!

00:40:00.994 --> 00:40:05.103
MATT: You dart forward across-- the guards that
are there watching this happen with the rest of

00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:10.944
the crew of The Mistake, you zip past them in this
blur, Flash-like entity. They all get pushed back

00:40:10.944 --> 00:40:17.432
from the impact as you push through. All right.
That finishes your turn. Now it's the

00:40:17.432 --> 00:40:21.586
guards. The guards--

00:40:21.627 --> 00:40:23.301
TALIESIN: Did that guard take damage?

00:40:23.301 --> 00:40:24.228
MATT: That guard did take damage.

00:40:24.228 --> 00:40:25.066
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:40:25.066 --> 00:40:35.606
MATT: He's looking real rough. He's going to back
up out of the middle of the sleet and make his way

00:40:35.606 --> 00:40:39.995
this way. He looks dazed and is trying to figure
out what's going on and where to ally himself

00:40:39.995 --> 00:40:47.165
with. You guys go running off the side as the
flames are down. They're going to give chase. This

00:40:47.165 --> 00:40:50.712
guard's going to rush up here and this guy's going
to rush up here. They're not attacking, but

00:40:50.712 --> 00:40:55.761
they're coming out towards you and saying, "Stop!
Stop! Halt!" They're shouting towards you guys to

00:40:55.761 --> 00:41:05.482
stop. The rest of the guards are going to push
forward and start making their way up this

00:41:05.482 --> 00:41:11.444
direction and they're starting to-- They're now
catching up. Four of them are going up towards

00:41:11.444 --> 00:41:16.425
Fjord and one of them is going back towards Caleb.
They're starting to gather and they're putting up

00:41:16.425 --> 00:41:22.297
their hands like: do not flee. They're not talking
yet, but you see their physicality is like, we

00:41:22.297 --> 00:41:24.646
don't know what's happening but don't you go
anywhere.

00:41:24.646 --> 00:41:27.804
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I wouldn't dream of it.

00:41:27.804 --> 00:41:43.495
MATT: That ends their go. It's now Ipess' turn. As
a bonus action, he's going to hide and move

00:41:43.495 --> 00:41:48.507
underneath and around the rocks to this side and
he's going to pull around from the corner with his

00:41:48.507 --> 00:41:55.079
hand crossbow and take a shot at Caduceus from
behind. Caduceus, what's your passive perception?

00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:57.867
TALIESIN: My passive perception is 18.

00:41:57.867 --> 00:42:03.009
MATT: 18, okay. You do notice him out of the
corner of your eye just barely, so he is not

00:42:03.009 --> 00:42:07.540
hidden from you. This means he does not get sneak
attack damage or advantage on the attack. That is

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.277
still a natural 20 on this hit.

00:42:09.277 --> 00:42:13.540
TALIESIN: Is he within 30 feet of me? Wait, no! I
can cast this on myself, can't I?

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.533
MATT: Which one?

00:42:14.533 --> 00:42:21.388
TALIESIN: Can I cast-- Let me take a look really
quick if I can do this. Sentinel. Can I cast

00:42:21.388 --> 00:42:22.808
Sentinel on myself?

00:42:22.808 --> 00:42:24.997
MATT: What does it say? What's the wording?

00:42:24.997 --> 00:42:27.108
TALIESIN: As a reaction, when you or a creature
you can see within 30 feet--

00:42:27.108 --> 00:42:28.066
MATT: When you or a creature?

00:42:28.066 --> 00:42:28.478
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

00:42:28.478 --> 00:42:29.456
MATT: Then yeah!

00:42:29.456 --> 00:42:31.158
TALIESIN: So none of that.

00:42:31.158 --> 00:42:36.508
MATT: You channel divinity to prevent the
critical. It is now a regular hit. Fantastic. You

00:42:36.508 --> 00:42:45.446
take three points of piercing damage. It sticks
into your shield and grinds inside and actually

00:42:45.446 --> 00:42:49.469
hits a little bit of the forearm, but you manage
to deflect most of the impact and bolt gets caught

00:42:49.469 --> 00:42:51.926
in the center of there, mostly no damage to you.

00:42:51.926 --> 00:42:56.660
TALIESIN: (nervous laugh) Cool.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.381
MATT: One of the guards turns and looks towards
Ipess-- Actually both of these guards turn and

00:43:01.381 --> 00:43:06.307
glance over and having this moment of not entirely
certain which side to go with.

00:43:06.307 --> 00:43:10.560
TALIESIN: I am looking irritated at the guards at
this.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:18.421
MATT: That ends there. It's now the rest of the
crew's turn. He's going to come to the side there,

00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:29.001
this one's going to move over to this side there,
this guy's going to run across, this one's going

00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:39.641
to move over here, and this half orc's going to go
and hide in there.

00:43:39.641 --> 00:43:40.883
SAM: Don't forget our crow's nest guy.

00:43:40.883 --> 00:43:55.922
MATT: With that, we've got some heavy crossbow
action from this guy and this guy. Caleb is out of

00:43:55.922 --> 00:44:07.301
range of both of them unfortunately. Both of these
guys right here, I'm going to roll four attacks.

00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:12.779
One of them is going to be heavy crossbow to
Fjord, because Fjord is still within-- Oh no, it's

00:44:12.779 --> 00:44:15.320
a 400-foot range for the next one.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.779
SAM: 400 feet?!

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:21.541
MATT: Yeah, heavy crossbow. With 100 feet, you're
going to be within the disadvantage range

00:44:21.541 --> 00:44:24.451
increment but those things are going to fire at
you, Caleb. Since you're the one that's the

00:44:24.451 --> 00:44:25.310
furthest away.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.240
TALIESIN: Caleb is not within 30 feet of me
either, is he?

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.772
MATT: No.

00:44:27.772 --> 00:44:28.841
TALIESIN: Just checking.

00:44:28.841 --> 00:44:34.575
MATT: He does have disadvantage on the attack
though. That is a 16 and a 13 naturally.

00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:35.385
LIAM: It hits.

00:44:35.385 --> 00:44:37.107
MATT: Plus four, it's going to be 17.

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:38.746
LIAM: My AC is 11.

00:44:38.746 --> 00:44:43.474
LAURA: Whoa, that's really low.

00:44:43.474 --> 00:44:48.107
MATT: That is nine points of piercing damage to
you.

00:44:48.107 --> 00:44:49.636
LIAM: Oh, I have nine hit points.

00:44:49.636 --> 00:44:50.565
MATT: Are you serious?

00:44:50.565 --> 00:44:52.635
LIAM: Yeah. I'm out.

00:44:52.635 --> 00:44:58.856
MATT: Caleb (thud). As he darts past, this bolt
streaks past, (impact noise) in the back and with

00:44:58.856 --> 00:45:02.990
the momentum of his running, he crumples into the
ground and tumbles and skids to a halt in the

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.345
middle-- You're watching this, Fjord, as this
happens. The other one up here at the top of the

00:45:07.345 --> 00:45:15.707
crow's nest, is going to take a shot at Nott,
actually. You are within the 100-foot range.

00:45:15.707 --> 00:45:19.645
That's still a natural two, so it misses you. It
splinters the wood right next to your foot as you

00:45:19.645 --> 00:45:23.708
step out of the way. Shards of wood go flying from
the impact and the heavy bolt, about that long, is

00:45:23.708 --> 00:45:32.504
jammed at an angle into the planks before you.
This one here and this one are both going to take

00:45:32.504 --> 00:45:39.834
heavy crossbow shots. One's at Caduceus and one's
at Yasha, so the most visible. Against Caduceus--

00:45:39.834 --> 00:45:44.786
oh, man, they're rolling terrible now. That's a
six.

00:45:44.786 --> 00:45:46.854
TALIESIN: I'm not even going to dignify that.

00:45:46.854 --> 00:45:52.246
MATT: Yeah. Yasha, however, does get hit with a
17, I believe. Right?

00:45:52.246 --> 00:45:53.356
TALIESIN: Travis? Yes.

00:45:53.356 --> 00:45:54.235
TRAVIS: What, sorry?

00:45:54.235 --> 00:45:57.246
MATT: Yasha takes eight points of piercing damage.
17 to hit, eight points reduced to four.

00:45:57.246 --> 00:46:01.376
TRAVIS: Got it.

00:46:01.376 --> 00:46:07.894
MATT: This guy here has a hand crossbow. You are
then in disadvantage range. He's going to take

00:46:07.894 --> 00:46:12.259
another shot at Caduceus with disadvantage. No,
that's another six.

00:46:12.259 --> 00:46:18.625
TALIESIN: He ain't going to be hitting me.

00:46:18.625 --> 00:46:25.146
MATT: Okay, that's the end of the crewmen there.
That's the end of the combat round. These people,

00:46:25.146 --> 00:46:29.566
seeing all the fighting, are going to duck into
their ship and hide. This team on this end, they

00:46:29.566 --> 00:46:34.007
all move out of the way but they're keeping an
eye, over the side, of what's happening. Top of

00:46:34.007 --> 00:46:45.597
the combat round: Beau and Jester. You appear,
Beau, in the middle of this chaos. Flames behind

00:46:45.597 --> 00:46:51.028
you. You hear a thunderous blast, that echoes from
behind. You glance over, you look forward,

00:46:51.028 --> 00:46:55.586
Jester's already running in the direction. You're
on the rough and tumble rock and elements of

00:46:55.586 --> 00:47:00.464
cobblestone that have long worn off and not been
replaced. In front of you, a little ways up ahead,

00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:05.335
you can see the tavern.

00:47:05.335 --> 00:47:06.528
MARISHA: The tavern?

00:47:06.528 --> 00:47:07.904
MATT: The Bloated Cup.

00:47:07.904 --> 00:47:12.974
MARISHA: I want to go around and I want to go
straight towards the Plank King.

00:47:12.974 --> 00:47:15.449
MATT: Okay, so you full run?

00:47:15.449 --> 00:47:21.670
MARISHA: I go: Jester, I'll see you there! I dart
by, and I also want to burn a ki point to do Step

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:34.057
of the Wind and run my full 135-foot movement
towards--

00:47:34.057 --> 00:47:39.199
MATT: In doing so, you make it all the way up. The
street's there, and there's buildings on each

00:47:39.199 --> 00:47:45.568
side. To the front right of you--this perspective
for you on this side is where you see the tavern.

00:47:45.568 --> 00:47:50.760
There are folks out there morning drinking, like,
"Whoa." Watch you whiz past. You make your way up

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.834
the street a little further and there are a few
town guards that are looking over towards the inn,

00:47:54.834 --> 00:47:57.830
the sound, and all the craziness happening, and
they notice you approaching and they all

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:03.209
instinctively begin to go into a phalanx. They all
go shoulder-to-shoulder and they're now blocking

00:48:03.209 --> 00:48:09.017
off the road from your continual passage. No
weapons drawn, but in the midst of all this, they

00:48:09.017 --> 00:48:15.259
see crazy stuff happening and the one person
darting at an inhuman speed away from it, and

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:21.759
their instinct is to go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's
figure this out." They're not aggressive yet.

00:48:21.759 --> 00:48:22.262
That's your turn?

00:48:22.262 --> 00:48:24.588
MARISHA: Can I say anything?

00:48:24.588 --> 00:48:26.699
MATT: I'd say this happens at the very end of your
turn. You're running, running, running, all of a

00:48:26.699 --> 00:48:30.604
sudden you stop right as they (clanking) right
there in front of you. We'll pick that up next turn.

00:48:30.604 --> 00:48:32.061
MARISHA: Okay.

00:48:32.061 --> 00:48:48.797
MATT: That brings us to Avantika's go. All right.
Oh, man. Okay. Avantika is going to leap down off

00:48:48.797 --> 00:48:51.110
the side of the ship. Acrobatics check.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.659
TRAVIS: And slip on the ice.

00:48:53.659 --> 00:48:57.326
MATT: No, it's just difficult terrain.

00:48:57.358 --> 00:48:59.096
TRAVIS: Just kidding. Wishful thinking!

00:48:59.096 --> 00:49:02.349
MATT: I will say, it would increase the DC for her
landing, I'll give you that. But she did roll an

00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:03.555
18 on her acrobatics check.

00:49:03.555 --> 00:49:05.135
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:49:05.135 --> 00:49:12.647
MATT: Leaping down, lands right in front of Nott.
Skids down, lands a few inches back before coming

00:49:12.647 --> 00:49:17.125
to a stop. The ice grinds at the back of her foot
and creates this little pile where the momentum

00:49:17.125 --> 00:49:22.218
eventually stops, holding her rapier in one hand
and the dagger in the other, looking down at you,

00:49:22.218 --> 00:49:29.119
Nott, goes, "Ah, you should not have crossed me."
She's going to take three strikes at you, two with

00:49:29.206 --> 00:49:35.730
her rapier and one with her dagger. The dagger,
you can see now, is-- You've seen it a little bit

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:41.409
in the battles. You were in dark spaces so it was
hard to make a real, distinguishing visual of it,

00:49:41.409 --> 00:49:46.278
but out here in the open air, as she's clutching
the dagger aggressively, there's a faint black

00:49:46.278 --> 00:49:52.808
energy faintly drifting off the edge of the blade.
The attack with the rapier, first one-- natural

00:49:52.808 --> 00:50:00.060
four, no, it's going to miss you. Natural three.
Both rapier shots, nothing. The dagger, however,

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.801
that's going to be a 17 to hit.

00:50:01.801 --> 00:50:03.052
SAM: That hits.

00:50:03.052 --> 00:50:11.559
MATT: Okay. She's rolling real bad. As the two
rapier shots, you dodge out of the way, but she

00:50:11.559 --> 00:50:17.749
uses that to feint forward and jam the blade up
into the front of your stomach and rib cage area.

00:50:17.749 --> 00:50:25.221
That is going to be nine points of piercing damage
and an additional eight points of necrotic damage.

00:50:25.221 --> 00:50:27.641
SAM: Uncanny dodge!

00:50:27.641 --> 00:50:29.250
MATT: Okay.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.701
SAM: Does that halve both of those?

00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:37.330
MATT: Yeah, it would halve both from the attack,
so take eight points of damage. You manage to push

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:42.208
away with your momentum, the blade doesn't sink
quite as deep, and you, grabbing the wrist

00:50:42.208 --> 00:50:46.819
preventing it from really coming to the hilt in
your chest, you pull away. That's going to end her

00:50:46.819 --> 00:50:54.979
turn. She shouts over her shoulder and goes,
"Vera, we need friends!" Jester, your turn.

00:50:54.979 --> 00:50:56.632
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:56.632 --> 00:50:59.472
MATT: You saw Beauregard dart up past you.

00:50:59.472 --> 00:51:03.518
LAURA: Is there an alley near me?

00:51:03.518 --> 00:51:08.360
MATT: If you look a little bit ahead of you,
around each of the buildings that are right in

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.912
front of you, there are alleys that curve around
that would eventually meet in the road that you

00:51:12.912 --> 00:51:14.019
guys are currently running down.

00:51:14.019 --> 00:51:16.943
LAURA: Anywhere where I can duck and cast Disguise
Self really fast?

00:51:16.943 --> 00:51:25.102
MATT: Yes, but you'd have to move up. You probably
wouldn't be able to get to an alley to do it this

00:51:25.102 --> 00:51:30.441
turn. There are people around. There are folks
that are watching all this chaos happen off in the distance.

00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:36.860
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to shout: Avantika is
attacking people on the island! She's trying to

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:41.329
upstage the Plank King! Everybody go see now!

00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:44.050
MATT: Okay, make a deception check.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:49.121
MARISHA: Can the guards that I'm near hear her?

00:51:49.121 --> 00:51:56.794
MATT: You're a little ways up. I'll roll a
perception check for them, how about that?

00:51:56.794 --> 00:51:58.349
LAURA: 14?

00:51:58.349 --> 00:52:04.821
MATT: That's a cocked roll. The guards
unfortunately do not hear it. They're not as

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:08.809
perceptive and their focus is distracted between
this, and they hear shouting, but they're not

00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:13.698
picking up the words. However, some of the folks
nearby glance over at you and go, "Oh, shit,

00:52:13.698 --> 00:52:16.969
"really?" Finishes his drink real fast.

00:52:16.969 --> 00:52:18.108
LAURA: Spread the word!

00:52:18.108 --> 00:52:23.607
MATT: "I've got to go see this!" They seem less
worried about their lives and more like, "Oh, I

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.816
"want to go see how this goes down."

00:52:25.816 --> 00:52:27.847
LIAM: Vanna's going on a prank binge!

00:52:27.847 --> 00:52:29.880
MARISHA: Fight, fight, fight!

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:35.289
LAURA: Right, right. Is anybody around me now?

00:52:35.289 --> 00:52:39.410
MATT: They're not around. In front of you there's
one coming out of a building and you see a couple

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:45.841
folks that are on the front porch entrance area of
the tavern.

00:52:45.841 --> 00:52:49.738
LAURA: I don't know if I want to run back or help
Beau!

00:52:49.738 --> 00:52:52.239
MATT: It's up to you. What are you doing?

00:52:52.239 --> 00:52:59.558
LAURA: I'm going to head back to the group. I'm
going to start running towards the group.

00:52:59.558 --> 00:53:05.646
MATT: Okay. Jester, you turn around and start
heading back towards the group. It's a long run

00:53:05.646 --> 00:53:07.198
because you went 500 feet from the ship.

00:53:07.198 --> 00:53:10.658
LAURA: I know. I'm going to duck into an alley as
soon as it's near so I can cast Disguise Self on

00:53:10.658 --> 00:53:12.552
my next turn.

00:53:12.552 --> 00:53:17.958
MATT: You go for it. That finishes your go.
Yasha's up.

00:53:17.958 --> 00:53:25.359
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha's up. She is going to make two
attacks against Avantika. She'll move into melee

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:32.127
with her and will make them both reckless
attacks.

00:53:32.127 --> 00:53:40.216
MATT: She's going to use her reaction to parry,
which adds a plus two to her armor class.

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.744
TRAVIS: That's a 17 to hit.

00:53:41.765 --> 00:53:42.963
MATT: That misses.

00:53:42.963 --> 00:53:48.871
TRAVIS: Good to know. These are terrible rolls.
That's a 25 to hit.

00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:50.822
MATT: 25 hits.

00:53:50.822 --> 00:53:54.841
SAM: Take her head off, Yasha!

00:53:59.441 --> 00:54:01.768
TRAVIS: 14 points of damage.

00:54:01.784 --> 00:54:05.017
MATT: 14 points of damage to Avantika. As the
blade carves through, she tries to parry it with

00:54:05.017 --> 00:54:10.238
the rapier, but it slips down and carves a slight
bit off of her forearm before it gleans off, and

00:54:10.238 --> 00:54:13.220
you can see a little bit of red immediately
exposed where the cloth was carved through, and a

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:17.129
little bit of the skin and flesh removed with it.

00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:22.017
TRAVIS: She will use the rest of her movement to
keep running up the dock.

00:54:22.017 --> 00:54:29.820
MATT: Okay, that's going to be (counting) 40.
That's as far as she can get.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.768
TRAVIS: Right, because it's fucking shitty
terrain.

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:33.170
MATT: Difficult terrain, yep.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:34.614
TRAVIS: Does she have anything that keeps her
from--?

00:54:34.614 --> 00:54:37.361
MARISHA: Dealing with that?

00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:38.964
TRAVIS: Like angel of death problem? No?

00:54:38.964 --> 00:54:40.313
MATT: As an action you can angel of death.

00:54:40.313 --> 00:54:43.048
MARISHA: Wings on ice?

00:54:43.048 --> 00:54:48.079
MATT: They're more for the surprise party factor
than the actual flight thing.

00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:49.210
TRAVIS: Nope, I don't see anything.

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:52.662
MATT: Okay, that finishes Yasha's go. Caduceus,
you're up.

00:54:52.662 --> 00:55:06.359
TALIESIN: Oh, man, wow, I am really stuck on that,
aren't I? That's irritating.

00:55:06.359 --> 00:55:11.200
MATT: There's the guards there. There's Avantika.
Avantika does not have a reaction; she already

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.850
used it to parry.

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:21.979
TALIESIN: That's difficult terrain, though, so if
I burn my action I'm only going to get 30 feet.

00:55:21.979 --> 00:55:23.839
MATT: Correct.

00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:25.350
TALIESIN: Hmm. Let's get weird. Okay.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:27.231
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's! Let's do it!

00:55:27.231 --> 00:55:29.790
LIAM: Get weird, Taliesin, get weird!

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:36.369
SAM: I'm going to make all the ice turn into
bugs.

00:55:36.369 --> 00:55:48.201
TALIESIN: I'm going to vanish. That's the first
thing I'm going to do.

00:55:48.201 --> 00:55:51.481
MATT: I'll say for the purposes of keeping tabs on
you, this will be your marker.

00:55:51.756 --> 00:55:53.923
SAM: Ooh, cool marker!

00:55:53.923 --> 00:55:56.251
MARISHA: See-through Caduceus.

00:55:56.251 --> 00:56:03.163
TALIESIN: There's a joke there that I cannot think
of what it is because I'm too freaked out. I can

00:56:03.163 --> 00:56:05.902
cast while I'm invisible, correct?

00:56:05.902 --> 00:56:11.188
MATT: No, it's your ability. As soon as you cast
something, you lose your invisibility.

00:56:11.188 --> 00:56:14.230
TALIESIN: Well, the invisibility only lasts one
round.

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:17.392
MATT: Actually, let me check the wording on that,
if it's different from the actual spell, because

00:56:17.392 --> 00:56:18.483
usually it's--

00:56:18.483 --> 00:56:20.269
TALIESIN: Not a big deal.

00:56:20.269 --> 00:56:24.732
LIAM: This encounter's getting to me. My body is
radiating heat. I'm hot everywhere. Flames! On the

00:56:24.732 --> 00:56:26.996
side of my face!

00:56:26.996 --> 00:56:29.462
MATT: "Can magically turn invisible until the
start of your next turn or until you attack, make

00:56:29.462 --> 00:56:32.620
"a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving
throw." You can cast a spell as long as it doesn't

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.020
damage or attack somebody.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.342
TALIESIN: As long as it's not a damage spell, I
can just--

00:56:38.342 --> 00:56:39.864
MATT: Or force someone to make a saving throw.

00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:47.108
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll just ignore that,
then. I'll stay invisible and I'm going to try and

00:56:47.108 --> 00:56:50.339
take my 60 feet.

00:56:50.339 --> 00:56:51.821
MATT: It would be 30 feet with this.

00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:52.619
TALIESIN: Yeah, my 30.

00:56:52.619 --> 00:57:00.101
MATT: (counting)

00:57:00.101 --> 00:57:04.022
TALIESIN: Can I get one further away, just to--

00:57:04.022 --> 00:57:06.281
MATT: You can go at an angle in front of Yasha.

00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:09.750
TALIESIN: Yeah, just to get a little cover. Thank
you!

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:14.391
MATT: That ends your go, Caduceus. Fjord, you're
up. Your friends are catching up behind you,

00:57:14.391 --> 00:57:17.537
there's a sleet storm slamming, there's guards
swarming around your direction telling you to

00:57:17.537 --> 00:57:23.148
halt, and up ahead of you you watched a speedy
Caleb grind into the ground. What are you doing?

00:57:23.148 --> 00:57:25.914
TRAVIS: We're going to get weird, right? All
right.

00:57:25.914 --> 00:57:27.090
MARISHA: Getting weird.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:32.982
TRAVIS: I'll look up and point above the stern of
the ship where Vera is, and my eyes will roll back

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:38.102
and I'll say: (deep voice) Barlgura, and I will
Summon Greater Demon.

00:57:38.102 --> 00:57:39.465
SAM: What?

00:57:39.465 --> 00:57:43.125
TRAVIS: I'm going to drop a barlgura right on
Vera's fucking head.

00:57:43.125 --> 00:57:45.114
LIAM: That was a sick description!

00:57:45.114 --> 00:57:49.085
TALIESIN: I have never been so proud.

00:57:49.085 --> 00:57:53.741
LIAM: That was like Babe Ruth summoning a demon
from hell.

00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:57.971
MATT: I wasn't sure if you had taken this spell. I
prepared for it just in case.

00:57:57.971 --> 00:58:00.809
SAM: What is that?

00:58:00.809 --> 00:58:02.871
MATT: This is it!

00:58:02.871 --> 00:58:06.055
ALL: Whoa!

00:58:06.055 --> 00:58:11.026
LAURA: Bouldergut has met her love. They start
making out.

00:58:11.026 --> 00:58:13.010
MATT: You'd be just on the edge of the ship
there.

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:16.883
TRAVIS: That's great. I want him right in their
fucking business.

00:58:16.883 --> 00:58:18.985
SAM: If you walk away, does he stay there?

00:58:18.985 --> 00:58:26.261
TRAVIS: I only command him for one round, and on
that command I will say: Fuck up that crew.

00:58:27.865 --> 00:58:33.496
MATT: With the dark speech that emanates from
inside of Fjord's body, it echoes out like a

00:58:33.496 --> 00:58:39.567
weird, discordant harmony of several voices you've
never heard. For those that are present. You guys

00:58:39.567 --> 00:58:40.935
are way the fuck away.

00:58:40.935 --> 00:58:43.427
TRAVIS: Fuck up that crew, fuck up that crew, fuck
up that crew!

00:58:43.427 --> 00:58:47.747
MATT: There's the sound of reality cracking and
you look up and watch where, in the center of the

00:58:47.747 --> 00:58:54.698
sky there, at the very edge of The Squalleater's
deck, two large, meaty hands pull open this

00:58:54.698 --> 00:59:01.655
barrier between the realms, and stepping out you
see this large, gorilla-like demon covered in fur

00:59:01.655 --> 00:59:06.568
and horns at the edge, these giant fists, with
tusks that emerge from beneath this chin and these

00:59:06.568 --> 00:59:12.697
red, burning, coal-like eyes. As it steps out, it
turns right towards Vera, whose eyes are wide, and

00:59:12.697 --> 00:59:19.895
(roars) in her face. You watch her hair get blown
back a bit, spittle across her chin. That's your action.

00:59:19.895 --> 00:59:25.763
TRAVIS: With my bonus action I'll turn to the
guards and go: Avantika's not to be trusted. I

00:59:25.763 --> 00:59:28.536
will Misty Step with my bonus action.

00:59:28.536 --> 00:59:32.012
MATT: All right, you manage to Misty Step.

00:59:32.012 --> 00:59:36.854
TRAVIS: 30 feet. Towards the direction of out. The
fuck out.

00:59:36.854 --> 00:59:38.498
MATT: Okay. This puts you--

00:59:38.498 --> 00:59:40.149
TRAVIS: Anywhere near Caleb?

00:59:40.149 --> 00:59:43.652
LIAM: 60 feet from Caleb at this point. I was 90
feet from Fjord.

00:59:43.652 --> 00:59:46.554
MATT: Correct. You went 30 feet forward and you
still have your movement.

00:59:46.554 --> 00:59:51.750
TRAVIS: I'll use the rest of my-- yeah I knew
that, I'm planning for that, yeah. I'll use the

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:55.393
rest of my 30 feet to run towards that unconscious
wizard.

00:59:55.393 --> 01:00:00.214
MATT: Okay, so you go heading towards Caleb. After
shouting, "Avantika's not to be trusted" after

01:00:00.214 --> 01:00:11.793
summoning a fucking demon, I'm going to ask you to
make a persuasion check with disadvantage. Because

01:00:11.793 --> 01:00:14.412
you just summoned a fucking demon.

01:00:14.412 --> 01:00:15.960
LAURA: Creepily. Very creepily.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.821
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.100
LAURA: Oh, god. Oh, god.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.370
(groaning)

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:20.161
TRAVIS: Six.

01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:27.167
MATT: All right. Well, they seem to be more
focused on what just appeared through the scar in

01:00:27.167 --> 01:00:32.073
reality you left. All right, so you charge past.
You're coming upon the group of guards now that

01:00:32.073 --> 01:00:35.322
are around the rest of the crew of the Mistake,
but they've forgotten about that crew at that

01:00:35.322 --> 01:00:40.688
point. They saw Caleb rush past. Two of them went
over to figure out what the hell happened as he

01:00:40.688 --> 01:00:45.700
basically darted-- football fumbled off to the
side. The others are turning and coming towards

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.868
your direction, but it's not their turn yet.

01:00:47.868 --> 01:00:48.519
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:00:48.519 --> 01:00:50.832
MATT: All right, that finishes your go, Fjord. It
is now Bouldergut's go.

01:00:50.832 --> 01:00:53.136
TRAVIS: Do I roll initiative for the barlgura?

01:00:53.136 --> 01:00:54.361
MATT: You do, yes.

01:00:54.361 --> 01:01:03.111
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a 17 plus-- I don't know if
there's any bonus. Maybe it's a 17.

01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:04.600
LIAM: Dex bonus?

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.279
TRAVIS: Dex plus two. So 19?

01:01:06.279 --> 01:01:07.452
MATT: 19, right after Avantika.

01:01:07.452 --> 01:01:11.999
TRAVIS: Okay. Good puppy.

01:01:11.999 --> 01:01:14.720
MATT: Oh, man.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.647
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter and noises)

01:01:18.647 --> 01:01:21.471
LIAM: (Bane impression) Your punishment will be
more severe.

01:01:21.471 --> 01:01:23.786
LAURA: It doesn't get to go as soon as you summon
it?

01:01:23.786 --> 01:01:29.055
TRAVIS: I don't-- It says it gets its own
initiative.

01:01:29.055 --> 01:01:33.269
MATT: Correct. When you summon it, on each of its
turns thereafter, you issue a verbal command to

01:01:33.269 --> 01:01:37.312
it, so you can keep issuing commands every turn.
However, it doesn't go until its next initiative.

01:01:37.312 --> 01:01:42.156
All right. That's real interesting.

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:43.029
TRAVIS: Uh huh.

01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:44.227
LIAM: This is fucking chaos.

01:01:44.227 --> 01:01:56.194
MATT: So, Bouldergut's going to move. (counting)
I'm going to make a saving throw for the now

01:01:56.194 --> 01:01:58.201
partially-damaged-- okay, yeah, that's fine.

01:01:58.201 --> 01:01:59.256
TRAVIS: The plank?

01:01:59.256 --> 01:02:09.934
MATT: The plank is going to snap. Gets her about
there, and is going do the dash up here. The next

01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:16.389
two guards who were now focused on Bouldergut
coming forward, and they're not entirely certain

01:02:16.389 --> 01:02:22.035
what's happening. They're focused on the demon.
There's weirdness from all sides. It seems the

01:02:22.035 --> 01:02:27.891
watch are not used to this chaos breaking this far
in towards Darktow. Usually, the reef and the

01:02:27.891 --> 01:02:33.558
defenses they built around the reef are enough to
keep things like this far from the island. That

01:02:33.558 --> 01:02:37.412
finishes Bouldergut's turn. That brings us to Nott
and Vera, but Nott, you get to go first.

01:02:37.412 --> 01:02:44.437
SAM: I will run full speed through the difficult
terrain. How far can I get?

01:02:44.437 --> 01:02:48.963
MATT: (counting) You're next to Yasha with your
movement.

01:02:48.963 --> 01:02:51.651
SAM: Okay. Then bonus, another--

01:02:51.651 --> 01:02:53.804
MATT: (counting) 25, 30.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:56.737
SAM: Now I'm right in front of these guards?

01:02:56.737 --> 01:02:59.816
MATT: You are, and you still have your bonus
action.

01:02:59.816 --> 01:03:07.726
SAM: I used movement and bonus action to move, and
I'll use action to-- (whispering) shit, who do I

01:03:07.726 --> 01:03:13.417
fuck up? (laughter) There's no one engaged with
anyone, so there's no one I can do sneak attack

01:03:13.417 --> 01:03:21.896
to. Instead, I'll do a Hail Mary. I'll take out a
bit of fleece, and rub it, and speak some words,

01:03:21.896 --> 01:03:24.599
and cast Phantasmal Force on Avantika.

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:26.118
MATT: Okay.

01:03:26.118 --> 01:03:30.261
SAM: She'll probably save, but it's worth a shot.

01:03:30.261 --> 01:03:31.795
MATT: What's the save?

01:03:31.795 --> 01:03:36.013
SAM: 14. Intelligence. She's smart.

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:37.431
TRAVIS: Roll low, roll low.

01:03:37.431 --> 01:03:38.143
MARISHA: Natural one.

01:03:38.143 --> 01:03:39.315
MATT: Natural five.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:41.027
TRAVIS: Ooh! What's her modifier though?

01:03:41.027 --> 01:03:44.835
MATT: She's very good at a few things, but she
doesn't have the highest intelligence to get to

01:03:44.835 --> 01:03:46.087
that point.

01:03:46.087 --> 01:03:46.741
SAM: Okay.

01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:48.341
MATT: She's smart, but not that smart.

01:03:48.341 --> 01:03:49.662
MARISHA: She went to public school!

01:03:49.662 --> 01:03:51.752
MATT: I went to public school.

01:03:51.752 --> 01:03:52.776
MARISHA: So did I.

01:03:52.776 --> 01:03:54.704
(laughter)

01:03:54.704 --> 01:03:57.789
MARISHA: We all have average intelligence, let's
be real.

01:03:58.271 --> 01:04:03.996
SAM: As Bouldergut is walking over, holding a
pick, or what?

01:04:03.996 --> 01:04:08.988
MATT: It's a giant-- it looks like it once was a
mast of a ship that's been whittled down into a greatclub.

01:04:08.988 --> 01:04:17.952
SAM: I want Avantika to see Bouldergut doing this
and holding up the book. Holding up the book and

01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:22.136
waving it around. She's definitely holding that
book.

01:04:22.136 --> 01:04:31.141
MATT: Okay. All right. Avantika glances over and
(sigh). For a moment, you see a look of relief

01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:33.151
come over Avantika's face.

01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:34.074
SAM: All right.

01:04:34.074 --> 01:04:35.127
MATT: All right. Is that your turn?

01:04:35.127 --> 01:04:36.410
SAM: Yes, that's it.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:46.063
MATT: You got it. Now, it's Vera's turn. Vera,
seeing this happen-- Oh man.

01:04:46.063 --> 01:04:49.798
MARISHA: But she believes it now. How long does
she believe it for?

01:04:49.798 --> 01:04:51.113
SAM: A minute.

01:04:51.113 --> 01:04:53.198
LIAM: Anything that keeps her occupied for one
round, but still.

01:04:53.198 --> 01:04:55.263
MARISHA: Okay, okay. A lot can happen in 60
seconds.

01:04:55.263 --> 01:05:01.779
MATT: All right. Vera's going to glance off to the
side-- Actually, she's going to try to move out of

01:05:01.779 --> 01:05:04.757
melee of this barlgura.

01:05:04.757 --> 01:05:06.407
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity?

01:05:06.407 --> 01:05:07.118
MATT: Yeah.

01:05:07.118 --> 01:05:07.731
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

01:05:07.731 --> 01:05:08.891
MATT: So, make a strike.

01:05:08.891 --> 01:05:17.114
TRAVIS: Okay. That is only a nine. Wait, that's a
nine.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:17.871
MATT: Nine misses.

01:05:17.871 --> 01:05:19.338
MARISHA: Nine.

01:05:19.338 --> 01:05:24.844
MATT: As the giant demon swings outward, it
impacts and deflects off the energy field of Mage

01:05:24.844 --> 01:05:29.672
Armor that pushes it off to the side. Vera steps
back. The reach on that is five foot, right? For

01:05:29.672 --> 01:05:32.185
the attack? Just making sure.

01:05:32.185 --> 01:05:33.318
TRAVIS: Yes, five feet.

01:05:33.318 --> 01:05:38.090
MATT: Okay, she pulls out of it and goes (harsh
sigh). Looks down at Avantika, looks down at all

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:40.390
the guards that are gathering as they're moving
in.

01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:47.566
(music plays)

01:05:47.566 --> 01:05:50.264
MATT: Just barely from that angle there.

01:05:51.099 --> 01:05:52.929
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

01:05:54.555 --> 01:06:03.807
MATT: Yeah, that does it. All right, she goes,
after hearing what Avantika said, goes, "Everyone,

01:06:03.807 --> 01:06:11.121
"they have crossed Darktow! Take them to the Plank
King!" You watch as she's saying these words, her

01:06:11.121 --> 01:06:15.373
hand sends this strange series of symbols through,
and casts Mass Suggestion on the guards in the

01:06:15.373 --> 01:06:16.783
vicinity of 60 feet of her.

01:06:16.783 --> 01:06:18.656
TRAVIS: Mass? Mass Suggestion?

01:06:18.656 --> 01:06:20.118
MATT: Yes.

01:06:20.118 --> 01:06:21.597
TRAVIS: That's new for me.

01:06:21.597 --> 01:06:23.733
TALIESIN: Being taken to the Plank King ain't
bad.

01:06:23.733 --> 01:06:34.815
MATT: Fail. Fail. Fail. It's working out great.
It's like, two, seven, four, three. Ten, fail.

01:06:34.815 --> 01:06:36.749
Natural one.

01:06:36.749 --> 01:06:38.800
TALIESIN: Do they even know who the Plank King
is?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.369
MATT: All of them failed. You watch as all of
these guards have the confusion suddenly

01:06:43.369 --> 01:06:51.415
crystalizes, and all of them look towards your
group and start shouting, "Stop them! They're thieves!"

01:06:51.415 --> 01:06:56.118
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. (stammers) We're thieves?

01:06:56.118 --> 01:07:00.158
MARISHA: They all failed their save. He thinks
that we're the bad guys now.

01:07:00.158 --> 01:07:01.859
SAM: (whispering) We are, kind of.

01:07:01.859 --> 01:07:03.823
(laughter)

01:07:03.823 --> 01:07:12.382
MATT: Vera, after casting that, is going to use
the rest of her movement. (counting) Oh, god.

01:07:12.382 --> 01:07:14.957
LIAM: She's dead. Oh, no, she passed out.

01:07:14.957 --> 01:07:21.235
MATT: I'll put her there, it's fine. All right,
that ends Vera's turn. Caleb, for your turn, make

01:07:21.235 --> 01:07:25.507
a death save. It's the beginning of your round. I
keep forgetting it's the beginning of your turn,

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:27.496
in case you roll a natural 20.

01:07:27.496 --> 01:07:30.841
LIAM: That is-- these dice-- That's a 17.

01:07:30.841 --> 01:07:32.232
MATT: Cool. That's one success.

01:07:32.232 --> 01:07:32.848
LIAM: Yeah.

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:33.889
MATT: All right.

01:07:33.889 --> 01:07:35.393
SAM: Deez dice.

01:07:35.393 --> 01:07:38.496
MATT: At the end of Vera's turn, this goes away.

01:07:38.496 --> 01:07:41.397
MARISHA and SAM: Oh.

01:07:41.397 --> 01:07:46.633
LAURA: Yeah, which sucks for us, and now they can
get to us faster.

01:07:46.633 --> 01:07:51.964
MATT: The sleet and stuff has now melted and
dripped off the sides. These guards here--

01:07:51.964 --> 01:07:55.402
LIAM: (guard impression) "What's all this, then?"

01:07:55.402 --> 01:08:06.306
MATT: (counting) 30 on each side, and they're both
going to attempt to grapple Yasha. Go ahead and

01:08:06.306 --> 01:08:10.234
make an athletics check for her. She has advantage
because she is raging.

01:08:10.234 --> 01:08:15.138
TRAVIS: Okay. That's 24. 21.

01:08:15.138 --> 01:08:18.843
MATT: Yeah, one guy fails to grapple. Then the
other guy's going to attempt to-- Make another

01:08:18.843 --> 01:08:22.239
check. She has to beat a 16.

01:08:22.239 --> 01:08:24.377
TRAVIS: 12, and that's a 21.

01:08:24.377 --> 01:08:30.291
MATT: Yeah, they just can't-- they try and grab
her, and she shrugs them off, no problem. These

01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:43.773
other guards here begin to swarm up to try and
grab Nott. This one's going to move up and try and

01:08:43.773 --> 01:08:50.176
grab Yasha. This one here is going to-- He tries
to move forward towards Yasha, and ends up

01:08:50.176 --> 01:08:56.522
chest-bumping space in the middle of the air, and
confusedly is going to try and grapple whatever's

01:08:56.522 --> 01:09:02.888
there. He has disadvantage on that, so first, I'm
going to do that with you. Rolled really well with

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:06.924
disadvantage, natural 19 and a natural 17. Make an
acrobatics or athletics check to see if he doesn't

01:09:06.924 --> 01:09:08.381
grapple you.

01:09:08.381 --> 01:09:11.355
TALIESIN: Acrobatics or athletics? Those are both
terrible, okay.

01:09:11.355 --> 01:09:14.576
SAM: You're a big thing.

01:09:14.576 --> 01:09:20.643
TALIESIN: I'm a big thing. A 20 is what I rolled.
I rolled a 19 plus one, so I'm going to do an

01:09:20.643 --> 01:09:21.732
acrobatics run.

01:09:21.732 --> 01:09:22.440
MATT: Okay.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.897
(laughter)

01:09:23.897 --> 01:09:25.672
TALIESIN: I am, to be fair, invisible. It's hard
to grab.

01:09:25.672 --> 01:09:32.757
MATT: No, no, no! He tries to grab you, and he
gets ahold of you, and you push him off, and he

01:09:32.757 --> 01:09:38.284
looks really confused. He grabbed something
before he really knew what was happening, and is

01:09:38.284 --> 01:09:41.081
really confused. For a moment, he thinks it was a
ghost.

01:09:41.081 --> 01:09:43.364
LIAM: Nothing but sparkle pony fur.

01:09:43.364 --> 01:09:46.882
MATT: For the one that rushed up to try to grab
Yasha again because the other guys failed, ooh,

01:09:46.882 --> 01:09:50.698
natural 18. So, roll for her. It's going to be a
20.

01:09:50.698 --> 01:09:53.296
TRAVIS: 16.

01:09:53.296 --> 01:09:58.686
MATT: She is currently grappled by this guy. He's
now grabbed and is holding her in place. She's

01:09:58.686 --> 01:10:03.119
(grunting). The two other guys are going to try to
dogpile in to try to stop her from moving. We have

01:10:03.119 --> 01:10:04.639
three attempting to grapple you, Nott.

01:10:04.639 --> 01:10:05.485
SAM: Three?

01:10:05.485 --> 01:10:06.084
MATT: Yes.

01:10:06.084 --> 01:10:08.474
MARISHA: You're tiny. You're dexy.

01:10:08.474 --> 01:10:10.124
SAM: Sure, sure. Here we go.

01:10:10.124 --> 01:10:11.195
MARISHA: Slippy.

01:10:11.195 --> 01:10:13.185
MATT: All right, so first guy--

01:10:13.185 --> 01:10:15.052
SAM: Do they roll? Do I roll?

01:10:15.052 --> 01:10:17.387
MATT: You roll an acrobatics check against them.

01:10:17.387 --> 01:10:18.997
SAM: 15.

01:10:18.997 --> 01:10:22.024
MATT: That's a success. Next guy, natural 20.

01:10:22.024 --> 01:10:23.430
LAURA: Oh, no.

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:24.358
MATT: That's 22.

01:10:24.358 --> 01:10:25.148
SAM: Natural 20.

01:10:25.148 --> 01:10:28.245
(surprised laughter)

01:10:28.245 --> 01:10:30.024
TALIESIN: What the fuck is happening?

01:10:30.024 --> 01:10:34.300
MATT: Oh, my god. All right, all right. So, he
manages to actually grab-- The first one, you're

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.870
just too slippery. "Oh, god!" You turn on the
side. The other guy grabs you. Right as he

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:44.367
squeezes, you just jump out of it, land on his
arms, and then step off. The third one's going to

01:10:44.367 --> 01:10:48.790
try and grab you. That's a six. Go and roll.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:50.543
SAM: 12.

01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:53.676
MATT: Okay, you still manage to slip away. None of
them can grab you. You're too fast! Tiny goblin

01:10:53.676 --> 01:11:01.265
form! "Quick! Nab her!" You're jumping around,
darting around, squeezing out of the way. No

01:11:01.265 --> 01:11:13.224
impact. All right, that finishes the guards' turn.
Ipess is going to (counting) try to hide at the

01:11:13.224 --> 01:11:21.755
top of it. Ooh, natural 20. So, he's going to
scoot up around the side, dart off the edge. He's

01:11:21.755 --> 01:11:30.230
going to make a shot at the barlgura, who has
shown up. With advantage, that is going to be a 19

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:31.424
to hit. What's its armor class?

01:11:31.424 --> 01:11:32.071
TRAVIS: 15.

01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:34.254
MATT: Okay. He does get sneak attack damage
against it.

01:11:34.254 --> 01:11:36.102
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:11:36.102 --> 01:11:38.640
MATT: That's an additional 2d6, so...

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.865
SAM: Does this thing have a name?

01:11:40.865 --> 01:11:42.815
TRAVIS: Barlgura. It has a demon name.

01:11:42.815 --> 01:11:43.933
SAM: Which is what?

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:46.869
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage. Does it have
any resistances?

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:54.964
TRAVIS: It does. It has damage resistance to cold,
fire, and lightning. Damage immunity to poison... yeah.

01:11:54.964 --> 01:11:56.422
MATT: Damage immunity to poison. That's all?

01:11:56.422 --> 01:11:57.505
TRAVIS: Condition immunities: poison.

01:11:57.505 --> 01:12:00.881
MATT: Got it. No immunities to non-magical
weapons?

01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:04.729
TRAVIS: No.

01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:07.870
MATT: Okay, just making sure. All right, yeah, so
it takes full damage on that. Mark that.

01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:09.079
TRAVIS: 14, right?

01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:18.766
MATT: Yeah. That's going to end Ipess's turn. Now
it's the crew's turn. This one's going to make a

01:12:18.766 --> 01:12:23.705
step back, trying to get out of range of the
barlgura. It already used its reaction to do an

01:12:23.705 --> 01:12:29.324
attack. It's going to reload and fire with its
crossbow against it. Ooh, that's going to be a 17

01:12:29.324 --> 01:12:30.959
to hit?

01:12:30.959 --> 01:12:31.739
TRAVIS: 17 hits.

01:12:31.739 --> 01:12:34.609
MATT: All right. It suffers eight points of
piercing damage.

01:12:34.609 --> 01:12:35.436
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:42.066
MATT: These guys here are going to fire down after
reloading. They're now focusing on the giant

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.405
demon. They're not focusing on you guys, so.

01:12:44.405 --> 01:12:45.204
SAM: That's great!

01:12:45.204 --> 01:12:46.680
MATT: They're turning like, "Oh, Jesus!"

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.442
TALIESIN: You are tanking. This is a tank. This is
a good tank.

01:12:49.442 --> 01:12:53.120
MATT: He's going to move over here, and attempt to
fire at it from there. This one's going to stand

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.511
where he is and reload. These guys are going to
spin around and focus on this terrible creature.

01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:10.461
All right. This guy here is going to stay behind.
That's (counting) six shots against the barlgura.

01:13:10.461 --> 01:13:12.345
TRAVIS: Six shots. Oh, fuck.

01:13:12.345 --> 01:13:16.995
MATT: So, all right. 18 to hit?

01:13:16.995 --> 01:13:17.833
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:19.971
MATT: One point of damage.

01:13:19.971 --> 01:13:20.826
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:13:20.826 --> 01:13:23.348
MATT: Nine to hit.

01:13:23.348 --> 01:13:25.408
TRAVIS: Yes. Oh, no, misses, sorry.

01:13:25.408 --> 01:13:28.375
MATT: All right. Seven to hit.

01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:30.633
TRAVIS: Misses. Three more.

01:13:30.633 --> 01:13:31.835
MATT: 18 to hit.

01:13:31.835 --> 01:13:32.538
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:13:32.538 --> 01:13:33.559
MATT: Nine points of damage.

01:13:33.559 --> 01:13:34.432
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:13:34.432 --> 01:13:36.383
MATT: 16 to hit.

01:13:36.383 --> 01:13:37.282
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:39.103
MATT: Seven points of damage.

01:13:39.103 --> 01:13:39.985
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:13:39.985 --> 01:13:42.713
MATT: The last one is 14 to hit.

01:13:42.713 --> 01:13:46.536
TRAVIS: Misses. Yeah, misses. Armor class 15.

01:13:46.536 --> 01:13:50.712
MATT: That finishes the crew's go as they're all
laying into this demon that appeared on there. You

01:13:50.712 --> 01:13:55.117
watch as (growl) as it turns back to yell, all of
a sudden it gets another bolt in the chest and in

01:13:55.117 --> 01:13:58.835
the side. It's getting all of these bolts that are
now sticking out of its body as it's raging

01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:05.301
angrily on the deck of the ship. You can see now
there's a giant, burned U on the side. It wasn't

01:14:05.301 --> 01:14:10.670
around long enough to catch the ship on fire, but
there is a dark scarring on the base of the deck

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:15.603
there. All right. One more round, and it would've
caught fire.

01:14:15.603 --> 01:14:21.805
LIAM: FYI, if I'd stayed conscious, I would've
thrown a Fireball at that boat.

01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:24.536
MATT: (laughter) That would've been great!

01:14:24.536 --> 01:14:25.783
LIAM: That was my next move.

01:14:25.783 --> 01:14:33.150
MATT: Oh, man. All right, that ends. Top of the
round. All right, so, Beau. The guards are there

01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:37.198
in front of you right now. There's three of them
shoulder to shoulder, and there's one of them that

01:14:37.198 --> 01:14:44.198
looks-- the one in the center is a little
better-armored. They go, "Hey, Miss, Miss, where

01:14:44.198 --> 01:14:47.552
"are you going?" They're looking at you and both
looking at what's over there.

01:14:47.552 --> 01:14:53.052
MARISHA: I have requested evidence for the Plank
King. He wants to see me directly. It's Avantika.

01:14:53.052 --> 01:14:57.933
There's a coup. She's trying to take over the city
with a demon god.

01:14:57.933 --> 01:15:02.086
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:15:02.086 --> 01:15:04.563
LAURA: Come on, Beau!

01:15:04.563 --> 01:15:06.702
MARISHA: Not deception?

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.715
MATT: No, because it's honest.

01:15:08.715 --> 01:15:12.484
MARISHA: Persuasion's not my best.

01:15:12.484 --> 01:15:15.120
MATT: There was nothing about that statement that
was incorrect.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.867
MARISHA: Okay! 13? Above average?

01:15:18.867 --> 01:15:25.375
MATT: You're not sure if he believes you, but he's
not aggressive, if that makes sense. He goes,

01:15:25.375 --> 01:15:31.955
"Well, be that as it may, we need to figure out
what's happening before we can have you running so

01:15:31.955 --> 01:15:33.777
"quickly with intent."

01:15:33.777 --> 01:15:38.358
MARISHA: Time is of the essence. They're killing
pirates who do not bend the knee to her. I've got

01:15:38.358 --> 01:15:40.995
to get to him now. Let me pass!

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:46.198
MATT: "We'll send for him. Stay here," and the two
other guards stay there, and hold the position and

01:15:46.198 --> 01:15:49.853
fill in the space. He turns around and starts
making his way towards the Throne Roost.

01:15:49.853 --> 01:15:51.285
MARISHA: Let me come with you!

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:53.483
MATT: He goes, "Ah! I've got it," and he continues
walking.

01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:55.704
SAM: Kill the guards.

01:15:55.704 --> 01:16:00.290
MATT: We'll say that you've used an action at this
point. You still have your bonus and your

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:02.542
movement, if you want to use it.

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:05.290
TRAVIS: Bathe in their blood. No, no!

01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:12.645
MATT: It's up to you. You can go along with it and
stay there and wait for your friends, or anything

01:16:12.645 --> 01:16:17.156
else you want to try. They are not aggressive at
this point; they're just holding the line.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.731
SAM: You've got a big stick.

01:16:18.731 --> 01:16:20.308
LAURA: Do not attack them!

01:16:20.308 --> 01:16:22.603
LIAM: Sam Riegel, shut the fuck up!

01:16:22.603 --> 01:16:28.839
MARISHA: I...

01:16:28.839 --> 01:16:29.548
wait.

01:16:29.848 --> 01:16:31.446
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:16:31.446 --> 01:16:39.198
MATT: The tension in your body is rising up, and
for a second, the muscles bulge and the veins

01:16:39.198 --> 01:16:43.329
begin to pop from the sheer amount of adrenaline
that's in your system and your urge to charge

01:16:43.329 --> 01:16:49.934
through. You just breathe heavily as your entire
form sinks into it. The two guards, you can see

01:16:49.934 --> 01:16:55.711
their tension, as their hands were going for a
weapon, drop. They both go into a watching but

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:59.880
waiting pose. That ends your go.

01:17:00.106 --> 01:17:01.882
LIAM: With great power.

01:17:01.882 --> 01:17:09.200
MATT: It's now Avantika's turn. Avantika sees the
guards shifting their allegiance under the effect

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:15.517
of this Mass Suggestion spell. She's going to turn
and attempt to go after Yasha.

01:17:15.517 --> 01:17:18.157
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:17:18.157 --> 01:17:19.574
MATT: What?

01:17:19.574 --> 01:17:21.767
LIAM: I'm angry at the villain; that's what I'm
supposed to be!

01:17:21.767 --> 01:17:22.570
MATT: Yeah!

01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:25.026
LIAM: You're doing great, everything is fantastic,
I'm having a wonderful time!

01:17:25.026 --> 01:17:28.458
TRAVIS: I'm having a wonderful time!

01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:30.939
LIAM: My ears are going to combust!

01:17:30.939 --> 01:17:39.476
MATT: Good. She's making three strikes against
her, because she's the one closest to it. Yeah,

01:17:39.476 --> 01:17:46.704
she's not too hurt. She's not doing anything
defensively. Or, you know what?

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:51.071
MARISHA: It's so tempting. I'm so tempted to just
bust through there.

01:17:51.071 --> 01:17:52.737
LIAM: It's so in character.

01:17:52.737 --> 01:17:56.335
MATT: No, Yasha's being held. As far as she knows,
Yasha is doing okay, or the guards have her. Nott

01:17:56.335 --> 01:18:00.811
is the one that keeps darting around, so she's
going to raise a hand and cast Eldritch Blast at Nott.

01:18:00.811 --> 01:18:04.079
SAM: Eldritch Blast.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:10.645
MATT: Ooh, that's 24 to hit.

01:18:10.645 --> 01:18:12.738
SAM: That'll hit.

01:18:12.738 --> 01:18:21.688
MATT: You take three points of force damage. As
you're jumping off, suddenly you get hit across

01:18:21.688 --> 01:18:26.407
the chin, but it's a glancing blow and your world
goes a little dizzy for a second. The second one

01:18:26.407 --> 01:18:28.439
misses entirely.

01:18:28.439 --> 01:18:30.957
SAM: You said three points, right?

01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:31.690
MATT: Yes.

01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:35.363
SAM: Oh. Okay. That's not as bad as I was
preparing for.

01:18:35.363 --> 01:18:37.757
MATT: She didn't roll very good on the damage.

01:18:37.757 --> 01:18:42.066
TRAVIS: Does a grapple count towards keeping rage
up? Is it an attack?

01:18:42.066 --> 01:18:48.426
MATT: Technically a grapple is an attack, yeah.
She's going to use her movement to back up five,

01:18:48.426 --> 01:18:52.034
six, going towards this, backing up towards the
ship.

01:18:52.034 --> 01:18:53.868
TRAVIS: She was not in melee with Yasha, right?

01:18:53.868 --> 01:18:57.257
MATT: Correct. Instead of doing that, she stayed
back to do that and is now looking up towards the

01:18:57.257 --> 01:19:02.905
demon that is raging onto the base of the ship.
Seeing the guards have got this under the

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:06.702
Suggestion spell, she seems to be backing off
slightly. That's going to finish Avantika's go.

01:19:06.702 --> 01:19:08.175
Now it's the barlgura's turn.

01:19:08.175 --> 01:19:16.190
TRAVIS: It is. The barlgura is going to use its
running leap to jump right on Vera.

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:18.435
MATT: Oh-ho-ho!

01:19:18.435 --> 01:19:19.683
MARISHA: Hot.

01:19:19.683 --> 01:19:26.649
TRAVIS: It will unleash three attacks, one with
its bite and two with its fists, and they will all

01:19:26.649 --> 01:19:28.698
be reckless.

01:19:28.698 --> 01:19:29.813
MATT: Because it can do that?

01:19:29.813 --> 01:19:30.478
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:19:30.478 --> 01:19:31.716
MATT: Go for it.

01:19:31.716 --> 01:19:39.829
TRAVIS: It's still alive. This is the first bite.
That's an 18. That's a 12, so the 18 plus seven.

01:19:39.829 --> 01:19:40.771
25 to hit?

01:19:40.771 --> 01:19:42.127
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll damage on that one.

01:19:42.127 --> 01:19:45.384
TRAVIS: Okay, and I'm throwing shit, no problem.

01:19:45.384 --> 01:19:48.751
MARISHA: Bling! Bling, bling, bling!

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:52.564
TRAVIS: That's 12 points of piercing damage for
the bite.

01:19:52.564 --> 01:19:58.457
MATT: Okay, good to know. She does succeed on her
constitution save with a natural 16. She does

01:19:58.457 --> 01:20:01.192
every time she takes damage to see if she can
maintain her Mass Suggestion.

01:20:01.192 --> 01:20:02.065
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

01:20:02.065 --> 01:20:02.964
LAURA: Oh, right

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:08.770
TRAVIS: 18, 12. For the fist attack, that's 23 to
hit?

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.336
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

01:20:10.336 --> 01:20:16.936
TRAVIS: A 1d10. That's a one, plus five, that's
five points of bludgeoning damage.

01:20:16.936 --> 01:20:18.578
MATT and LAURA: One plus five is six.

01:20:18.578 --> 01:20:19.392
TRAVIS: Yeah, that.

01:20:19.392 --> 01:20:23.288
MATT: All right. Natural 12, succeeds on the
save.

01:20:23.288 --> 01:20:24.199
TRAVIS: Succeeds?

01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:25.579
MARISHA: (chanting) Public school!

01:20:25.579 --> 01:20:27.335
TRAVIS: Shit, all right.

01:20:27.335 --> 01:20:29.579
MATT: Her con bonus isn't that high, so it's just
a straight roll on the d20.

01:20:29.579 --> 01:20:31.229
TRAVIS: That's a 16 to hit.

01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:32.905
MATT: 16 does hit. All three hit.

01:20:32.905 --> 01:20:36.655
TRAVIS: Fucking shit! Six points of bludgeoning
damage.

01:20:36.655 --> 01:20:39.360
LAURA: Fucking balls! Get rid of that fucking
dice.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.608
SAM: Lot of fucks from the Willingham family.

01:20:42.608 --> 01:20:48.678
MATT: That's a natural ten, just barely makes it.
Does not drop concentration. But took some hits.

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:54.739
Vera's looking a little roughed up and scared as
shit. She runs down the stairs and turns around

01:20:54.739 --> 01:21:00.639
and sees this thing. (roars) It starts roughing
her up. She's thrown against the back, is pummeled

01:21:00.639 --> 01:21:05.258
into the side of the ship and is trying
desperately to look for a way to escape.

01:21:05.258 --> 01:21:06.289
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:21:06.289 --> 01:21:08.794
MATT: That ends the barlgura's turn. I need you to
take a charisma saving throw for it.

01:21:08.794 --> 01:21:11.463
MARISHA: You have to stay far away from Winston.

01:21:11.463 --> 01:21:14.850
TALIESIN: Wow. Really? Now? Really?

01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:18.802
TRAVIS: That's a natural one-- No, that's a two
minus one.

01:21:18.802 --> 01:21:21.967
LIAM: So an unnatural one.

01:21:21.967 --> 01:21:23.972
TRAVIS: So I lose the ability to control it.

01:21:23.972 --> 01:21:24.908
MATT: Correct.

01:21:24.908 --> 01:21:29.325
TRAVIS: And it attacks the nearest non-demon thing
for six rounds.

01:21:29.325 --> 01:21:32.566
MATT: Correct, and then it returns to its home
plane.

01:21:32.566 --> 01:21:33.906
TRAVIS: Disappears.

01:21:33.906 --> 01:21:34.823
LIAM: Six rounds.

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:36.460
TRAVIS and LAURA: Dis-ta-peels

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:37.413
TALIESIN: So that's fine.

01:21:37.413 --> 01:21:38.870
LIAM: That's fine. Six rounds of carnage.

01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:41.130
TRAVIS: That was a great idea.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:42.688
TALIESIN: This is six rounds of, "Well, that's
okay."

01:21:42.688 --> 01:21:44.280
TRAVIS: Yeah. I was like: I don't know if this
will ever be-- That could work.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:51.713
MATT: Well, no, you haven't lost concentration on
it yet. It stays for the hour, but then once you

01:21:51.713 --> 01:21:54.817
lose concentration, roll a d6 to see how many more
rounds it stays.

01:21:54.817 --> 01:21:58.561
TRAVIS: I understand. I thought it was different.

01:21:58.561 --> 01:21:59.579
MATT: Nope.

01:21:59.579 --> 01:22:00.983
TRAVIS: Thank you for that clarification.

01:22:00.983 --> 01:22:03.157
MATT: No worries. That ends the barlgura's turn.
Jester, you're up.

01:22:03.157 --> 01:22:04.083
LAURA: Okay.

01:22:04.083 --> 01:22:06.622
MATT: You've ducked to the side. You've cast
Disguise Self on yourself.

01:22:06.622 --> 01:22:09.438
LAURA: To look like a pirate.

01:22:09.438 --> 01:22:10.278
MATT: Okay.

01:22:10.278 --> 01:22:13.171
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to--

01:22:13.171 --> 01:22:15.237
MATT and LAURA: Like a pirate.

01:22:15.237 --> 01:22:23.361
LAURA: I'm going to walk out and start shouting at
guards nearby. Avantika's attacking everyone! I

01:22:23.361 --> 01:22:30.779
heard 'em say it! Avantika's-- She's finally doing
it! She's trying to take over! She's finally doing it!

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.958
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:22:32.958 --> 01:22:34.423
SAM: We always knew she was--

01:22:34.423 --> 01:22:36.825
TALIESIN: I'm mad as hell! And I'm not going to
take it anymore!

01:22:36.825 --> 01:22:41.958
LAURA: 20!

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:49.712
MATT: Okay. People in the nearby streets that are
seeing this go like, "Are you serious? That crazy bitch!"

01:22:49.712 --> 01:22:52.280
LAURA: She's finally-- Finally!

01:22:52.280 --> 01:23:00.960
MATT: A few people nearby take this and go, "Oh,
oh!" and start going inside to avoid this. Other

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.870
folks are getting angry and throwing their glasses
on the ground and, "Oh! I knew one day-- Ugh!"

01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:10.588
They're pissed and going to grab their things and
maybe start a militia against her. We don't know.

01:23:10.588 --> 01:23:14.093
You've rallied the corner.

01:23:14.093 --> 01:23:18.628
LAURA: Okay, good. Are there any guards within
earshot that heard me shouting?

01:23:18.628 --> 01:23:25.900
MATT: There are guards rushing towards the action
that's happening behind you, and there are a few

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:29.658
that are-- There's a bunch now making their way
towards this intersection.

01:23:29.658 --> 01:23:33.714
LAURA: I'm definitely waving my tankard around and
shouting at them. Ah! The docks!

01:23:33.714 --> 01:23:37.666
MATT: Okay. You're up ahead and you hear this in
the back, but you don't know it's Jester. You just

01:23:37.666 --> 01:23:41.321
hear a lot of shouting, so you're like, "Oh man,
my deception worked, other people are yelling this!"

01:23:41.321 --> 01:23:43.958
MARISHA: I go: See? To the guards next to me.

01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:45.281
MATT: Perfect.

01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:47.697
LIAM: (nonsensical rabble rousing)

01:23:47.697 --> 01:23:51.332
MATT: That finishes Jester's turn. It's Yasha's
go. Yasha is currently grappled, but you can still

01:23:51.332 --> 01:23:55.502
make her actions. She has to use an action to
break free if she wants to to move, but otherwise

01:23:55.502 --> 01:23:58.877
her movement is zero. But she has advantage
because she's still raging.

01:23:58.877 --> 01:24:01.313
TRAVIS: She's going to try to break the grapple.

01:24:01.313 --> 01:24:03.921
MATT: All right, make an athletics check with
advantage.

01:24:03.921 --> 01:24:08.696
TRAVIS: 22. 22.

01:24:08.696 --> 01:24:09.707
MATT: He got a six.

01:24:09.707 --> 01:24:10.486
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

01:24:10.486 --> 01:24:14.929
MATT: So the guy managed to luckily grapple her
last turn. She just flicks him off. He's like,

01:24:14.929 --> 01:24:17.088
"Ow!" So she's free of the grapple.

01:24:17.088 --> 01:24:25.450
TRAVIS: She's free of the grapple and she's going
to turn and say: Not me, them! And not attack. Or run.

01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:26.421
MATT: Okay.

01:24:26.421 --> 01:24:31.670
TRAVIS: There's three people around her in melee.
She's not going to run.

01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:33.721
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:24:33.721 --> 01:24:34.818
TRAVIS: That's it.

01:24:34.818 --> 01:24:35.881
LIAM: Yeah, good call.

01:24:35.881 --> 01:24:38.907
MATT: All right, that ends Yasha's turn.
Caduceus.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.329
TALIESIN: I Immediately turn visible.

01:24:41.329 --> 01:24:42.822
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:24:42.822 --> 01:24:47.829
TALIESIN: Hey.

01:24:47.829 --> 01:24:52.286
MATT: They all (gasp).

01:24:52.286 --> 01:24:57.240
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- Yeah. I'm just going to
help my friend there. I'm not going anywhere,

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:06.281
it'll be fine. I'm going to cast Bless on Nott and
Yasha and can I Bless myself or can I not Bless myself?

01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:08.757
MATT: You can Bless yourself.

01:25:08.757 --> 01:25:11.214
TALIESIN: I can Bless myself. So I'm going to cast
Bless on the three of us.

01:25:11.214 --> 01:25:12.665
MATT: All right. That gives you d4.

01:25:12.665 --> 01:25:16.896
TALIESIN: That's a d4 to your saving throws and to
your attacks.

01:25:16.896 --> 01:25:17.980
MATT: There you go.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:21.738
TALIESIN: All your saving throws and your attacks
you add a d4.

01:25:21.738 --> 01:25:23.515
SAM: Just once though, right?

01:25:23.515 --> 01:25:28.468
TALIESIN: No, it's a concentration spell, so. A
little something something.

01:25:28.468 --> 01:25:31.250
MATT: Okay, so that ends your turn. Or what else
you doing?

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:36.569
TALIESIN: Does it look like he's going to make an
attack? Because I'm going to start scooting towards--

01:25:36.569 --> 01:25:41.758
MATT: There's no attack. He looks startled, and
his hands are forward to try and-- They're not

01:25:41.758 --> 01:25:45.677
weapon drawn to bludgeon you, but they're trying
to keep you from going anywhere.

01:25:45.677 --> 01:25:48.413
TALIESIN: How far away is Caleb, currently?

01:25:48.413 --> 01:25:50.259
LIAM: 95 or 100 feet.

01:25:50.259 --> 01:25:54.625
MATT: From where you are there, 90 from there,
about 110 feet from you.

01:25:54.625 --> 01:26:02.186
TALIESIN: I'm going to point and start walking
that way, just going-- Is he going to make a swing?

01:26:02.186 --> 01:26:04.021
MATT: He's going to attempt to stop you.

01:26:04.021 --> 01:26:09.157
TALIESIN: Okay, I can't use a bonus action to
convince him to let me walk by, can I?

01:26:09.157 --> 01:26:10.423
SAM: You're invisible.

01:26:10.423 --> 01:26:15.189
MATT: No. Unfortunately, you may not know this,
they are currently magically compelled.

01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:18.507
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. Would I know that or would I
not know that?

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:19.529
MATT: You would not know that.

01:26:19.529 --> 01:26:22.978
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair. All right. It's
looking like he's going to hold--

01:26:22.978 --> 01:26:28.359
MATT: As you're trying to tell him this and trying
to scoot by, he like--

01:26:28.359 --> 01:26:34.011
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn to the other side of
him while not being very aggressive and I'm going to--

01:26:34.011 --> 01:26:36.376
MATT: He heads you off of the pass and is saying,
"Stay put."

01:26:36.376 --> 01:26:38.411
TALIESIN: I know, but he's--

01:26:38.411 --> 01:26:39.372
MATT: "Stay put."

01:26:39.372 --> 01:26:40.518
TALIESIN: He needs a little bit of healing--

01:26:40.518 --> 01:26:41.501
MATT: "He'll deal with it. Stay put!"

01:26:41.501 --> 01:26:44.576
TALIESIN: While we're having that conversation,
I'm going to flip around to the other side of him

01:26:44.576 --> 01:26:47.159
so I'm a little further away from Yasha. The other
way.

01:26:47.159 --> 01:26:48.323
MATT: The other way?

01:26:48.323 --> 01:26:52.116
TALIESIN: Yeah. Keep going. There. Not quite in
contact with the other--

01:26:52.116 --> 01:26:53.926
MATT: Okay. There's other guards here, that are--

01:26:53.926 --> 01:26:56.138
TALIESIN: I'm not going to quite bump into them,
you know.

01:26:56.138 --> 01:26:58.581
MATT: Okay. He's still trying to maneuver around.

01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:04.608
TALIESIN: Is there shit I can do with my bonus or
is there nothing I can do with my bonus? Probably

01:27:04.608 --> 01:27:17.640
not. That might be everything I can do. Yeah, I'm
going to cast a quick Healing Word on Yasha who

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.705
could probably use a quick Healing Word.

01:27:19.705 --> 01:27:21.547
TRAVIS: Okay. She'll take it.

01:27:21.547 --> 01:27:23.537
TALIESIN: So take a little--

01:27:23.537 --> 01:27:25.886
MATT: Fjord, you're up next.

01:27:25.886 --> 01:27:29.060
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's nice. Take an extra nine
points of healing.

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.463
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.

01:27:30.463 --> 01:27:33.256
MATT: There you go. All right. Fjord, it's your
go.

01:27:33.256 --> 01:27:35.284
TRAVIS: My distance from Caleb, please.

01:27:35.284 --> 01:27:37.113
LIAM: 30 feet.

01:27:37.113 --> 01:27:40.313
MATT: Yeah, with the Misty Step and the movement
you had. So you are 30 feet from him.

01:27:40.313 --> 01:27:43.581
TRAVIS: Amazing. I will use my 30 feet of movement
to close to Caleb.

01:27:43.581 --> 01:27:47.279
MATT: As you do, you rush past some of the guards
that are on the opposite side that were rushing

01:27:47.279 --> 01:27:52.720
towards you. There's, I believe at this point,
four of them that were heading your direction,

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.768
because there was the one that was going towards
Caleb. So we'll say two of them you'll have to

01:27:55.768 --> 01:27:59.474
push past. They both are going to make attacks of
opportunity on you. Just an attempt to grapple to stop.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.426
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:28:01.426 --> 01:28:05.478
MATT: Make your acrobatics or athletics check to
try and break free.

01:28:05.478 --> 01:28:11.368
TRAVIS: Acrobatics or athletics. We'll make it
athletics, straight up. That is a 17.

01:28:11.368 --> 01:28:15.942
MATT: That succeeds. They literally rolled a
natural 14 plus two. 16 was the highest roll. The

01:28:15.942 --> 01:28:21.734
other rolled a two. You manage to shrug past. You
push out of his grasp. He's like, "Hey, wait!"

01:28:21.734 --> 01:28:23.497
TRAVIS: Great. One more.

01:28:23.497 --> 01:28:24.868
MATT: Well, no, you--

01:28:24.868 --> 01:28:30.138
TRAVIS: That was it? Yeah, oh, okay. I'll run down
and kneel next to Caleb and go: (English accent)

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:34.248
Help me help this man! I will pour a healing
potion into his mouth.

01:28:34.248 --> 01:28:36.119
SAM: Ooh! He does have a potion.

01:28:36.119 --> 01:28:39.024
MATT: All right. So you come to consciousness on
the ground.

01:28:39.024 --> 01:28:53.301
LIAM: (groaning) Hey. I think I skinned my face.
Ah! Done. I don't know what's going on.

01:28:53.301 --> 01:28:59.234
MATT: Well. Now it's Bouldergut's turn.
Bouldergut's going to move up, shove past, and

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:03.398
begin to take a giant club towards the barlgura.
Down towards it.

01:29:03.398 --> 01:29:05.707
LAURA: Make out!

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:10.715
MATT: First hit is a 20 to hit?

01:29:10.715 --> 01:29:12.094
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:29:12.094 --> 01:29:13.244
MATT: Other's an 18.

01:29:13.244 --> 01:29:14.822
TRAVIS: Okay. They both hit.

01:29:14.822 --> 01:29:19.741
MATT: Both hit, okay. First hit is 12 points of
bludgeoning damage.

01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:21.033
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:29:21.033 --> 01:29:24.196
MATT: The other one is 16 points of bludgeoning
damage.

01:29:24.196 --> 01:29:25.533
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:29:25.533 --> 01:29:27.371
SAM: Matty? Can Avantika see that happening?

01:29:27.371 --> 01:29:28.947
MATT: Avantika see what?

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:33.783
SAM: Her friend using her book to smash on top of
somebody else's head?

01:29:33.783 --> 01:29:35.587
MATT: Yeah. It's really confusing.

01:29:35.587 --> 01:29:36.733
TRAVIS: Those last attacks were reckless.

01:29:36.733 --> 01:29:42.435
MATT: She's like, "No! What are you doing!" But
she's used to Bouldergut not being the brightest.

01:29:42.435 --> 01:29:46.636
TRAVIS: His last attacks were reckless, so you
could roll twice for both of them, if you want.

01:29:46.636 --> 01:29:47.613
MATT: What's that?

01:29:47.613 --> 01:29:48.424
TRAVIS: She--

01:29:48.424 --> 01:29:53.946
MATT: Oh, reckless. That's right, yeah. No! A four
and a two. So both of those worked out fine.

01:29:53.946 --> 01:29:59.942
That's the end of Bouldergut's turn. Bouldergut's
slamming onto this demon going, "Go to sleep!

01:29:59.942 --> 01:30:07.968
"Don't hurt my friends!" Finishing her go, it is
now Nott's turn.

01:30:07.968 --> 01:30:10.099
SAM: I'm surrounded by three guards?

01:30:10.099 --> 01:30:14.449
MATT: Yes, and they're all-- hands on their
weapons, trying to subdue you and grab you.

01:30:14.449 --> 01:30:23.129
They're now shouting, "Stop! Halt!" I say guards.
They're all volunteer pirates of The Revelry that

01:30:23.129 --> 01:30:26.043
help keep watch on the shipyard here.

01:30:26.043 --> 01:30:27.324
TALIESIN: They have an official sash.

01:30:27.324 --> 01:30:31.917
SAM: The ones around Yasha, are those the same
guards or are any of these people from the ship?

01:30:31.917 --> 01:30:36.028
MATT: No, the ones from the ship are further this
way, and they were being brought by guards, but

01:30:36.028 --> 01:30:40.545
they've been left alone to focus on you guys.
Yasha currently is stopped, and they're all very

01:30:40.545 --> 01:30:45.050
much in a "stay there" type position. They're in
the process of subduing their quarry.

01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:47.378
TRAVIS: I healed Caleb nine points.

01:30:47.378 --> 01:30:48.714
MATT: Gotcha.

01:30:48.714 --> 01:30:56.943
SAM: I will disengage and make my way towards
Fjord and Caleb.

01:30:56.943 --> 01:31:02.248
MATT: You slip past and make your way up towards
Fjord and Caleb. With your disengage, and your

01:31:02.306 --> 01:31:05.156
movement, and your action, you can make your
way--

01:31:05.156 --> 01:31:06.864
SAM: 60 more feet, I think.

01:31:06.864 --> 01:31:10.442
MATT: Yeah, 60 feet. From there, that would put
you not quite to where they are, but it gets you

01:31:10.442 --> 01:31:13.606
up to where the other guards were that he rushed
past, and just beyond them, because disengaged,

01:31:13.606 --> 01:31:22.488
they don't get any attacks of opportunity. All
right, that ends your turn? Vera is looking not

01:31:22.488 --> 01:31:26.642
too great. Vera is going to--

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:36.016
TRAVIS: (laughter) Go!

01:31:37.034 --> 01:31:40.665
MATT: Is going to cast Scorching Ray against the
barlgura. She's going to attempt to take a step

01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:43.309
back up the stairs. Barlgura does get an attack of
opportunity on her.

01:31:43.309 --> 01:31:45.342
LAURA: Yeah! Balgura, fuck her up!

01:31:45.342 --> 01:31:49.186
TRAVIS: Oh, I do? Okay, I will make it a fist
attack.

01:31:49.186 --> 01:31:50.880
LIAM: Fist to the skull!

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.691
TRAVIS: Reckless.15.

01:31:54.691 --> 01:31:57.387
MATT: 15 just hits. Just hits.

01:31:57.387 --> 01:31:59.570
LAURA: Get a ten!

01:31:59.570 --> 01:32:06.580
TRAVIS: It's a six plus four. That's ten points of
damage.

01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:11.619
MATT: Ten points of damage, ugh. All right, makes
it. Natural ten again. Doesn't break the spell.

01:32:11.619 --> 01:32:12.938
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:32:12.938 --> 01:32:16.941
MATT: She's having good luck with those rolls.
Takes it, climbs to the top, spins around, is

01:32:16.941 --> 01:32:24.392
going to Scorching Ray towards the barlgura.
That's 3d20s against it. Okay, that's going to be

01:32:24.392 --> 01:32:28.976
20, 20, and 17.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:30.615
TRAVIS: To hit? Or damage points?

01:32:30.615 --> 01:32:31.106
MATT: To hit.

01:32:31.106 --> 01:32:32.420
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, they all hit.

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:36.819
TALIESIN: Is he within 30 feet of me? No, not 30
feet. Goddamn it.

01:32:36.819 --> 01:32:46.069
MATT: No. All right. Not a great damage roll. The
balgura takes 18 points of fire damage.

01:32:46.069 --> 01:32:48.450
TRAVIS: Halved because it has resistance to nine.

01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:50.967
MARISHA: Is it still alive?

01:32:50.967 --> 01:32:53.139
SAM: It's alive? Oh, wow!

01:32:53.139 --> 01:32:54.974
TRAVIS: We're in single digits, kids!

01:32:54.974 --> 01:32:56.192
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

01:32:56.192 --> 01:32:57.018
SAM: Caleb.

01:32:57.018 --> 01:32:58.976
LIAM: I'm just--

01:32:58.976 --> 01:33:02.830
MATT: You wake up, come to consciousness on the
ground. Fjord is getting you up. You look over

01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:06.678
your shoulder, and you can see there's a whole
shit ton of guards in the area that are subduing

01:33:06.678 --> 01:33:11.150
Yasha. Caduceus seems to have put his hands up.

01:33:11.150 --> 01:33:14.678
LIAM: What is my distance from the boat?

01:33:14.678 --> 01:33:20.371
MATT: From the boat? From now, you'd be about 160
feet.

01:33:20.371 --> 01:33:24.230
LIAM: 160 feet? If I got to my feet, that's half
my movement.

01:33:24.230 --> 01:33:25.387
MATT: Correct.

01:33:25.387 --> 01:33:30.392
LIAM: If I moved ten feet I'd be within 150 feet,
correct? Yeah?

01:33:30.392 --> 01:33:31.618
MATT: Yeah.

01:33:31.618 --> 01:33:38.761
LIAM: So I will weakly stand, and I will weakly
trudge ten feet forward, and I will throw a

01:33:38.761 --> 01:33:43.812
Fireball and center it-- where's Vera?

01:33:43.812 --> 01:33:47.467
TRAVIS: She was over here.

01:33:47.467 --> 01:33:50.725
MATT: In your state-- where do you want to put
it?

01:33:50.725 --> 01:33:52.878
LIAM: Well, where's Avantika? I don't know.

01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:54.369
MATT: You don't know. Where are you putting it?

01:33:54.369 --> 01:33:56.627
LIAM: I'm putting it there, at the mast.

01:33:56.627 --> 01:34:06.638
MATT: At the mast? All righty. As you wake up, you
spin, fire. This ray streaks past. All the guards,

01:34:06.638 --> 01:34:14.061
who are calm at this point, see this happen, and
watch the streak go by and detonate on the ship.

01:34:14.061 --> 01:34:18.091
The bright flash of light echoes against
everybody's faces as the impact hits. Go ahead and

01:34:18.091 --> 01:34:19.430
roll damage.

01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:22.710
LIAM: I don't know what's going on. I'm doing the
last thing that was on my mind.

01:34:22.710 --> 01:34:24.362
MATT: Yeah, totally, man.

01:34:24.362 --> 01:34:25.952
LIAM: 8d6.

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:32.000
SAM: Avantika's not going to be alive to defend
herself against our accusations.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.996
LIAM: She will.

01:34:33.996 --> 01:34:35.671
MATT: That'll go well.

01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:38.397
TRAVIS: That would be our line.

01:34:38.397 --> 01:34:43.918
SAM: No, really! She was a really bad person
before we killed her and everyone on the boat.

01:34:43.918 --> 01:34:45.438
TRAVIS: She's on the lip.

01:34:45.438 --> 01:34:46.298
LIAM: 31.

01:34:46.298 --> 01:34:47.778
MATT: 31, good rolls.

01:34:47.778 --> 01:34:48.891
LIAM: Yes, good rolls.

01:34:48.891 --> 01:34:54.702
MATT: Okay, so, Bouldergut, that's a fail.
Bouldergut's looking rough.

01:34:54.702 --> 01:34:58.637
LIAM: So Caleb's whole face and cheek, one side is
skinned.

01:34:58.637 --> 01:35:06.903
MATT: Just a strawberry scrape. All right, this
guy. What's the DC on it?

01:35:06.903 --> 01:35:26.677
LIAM: Oh, on mine? That would be on mine-- sorry,
everybody. Scheisse. I think it's 16?

01:35:26.677 --> 01:35:31.823
MATT: It should be 16, I think,. It's eight plus
your proficiency plus that.

01:35:31.823 --> 01:35:33.033
LIAM: Yeah, 16.

01:35:33.033 --> 01:35:42.429
MATT: All right, so he succeeds. He rolled a 17,
so he takes-- 31, you said? So 15 points of damage

01:35:42.429 --> 01:35:48.634
to him. Oh, he's dead. He's fucking done. He took
damage from the Fire Wall earlier.

01:35:48.634 --> 01:35:53.071
SAM: Oh, that's the guy who was already at the
gangplank?

01:35:53.071 --> 01:36:00.185
MATT: Yeah. That guy, he makes his save, but he
dies too.

01:36:00.185 --> 01:36:02.271
LAURA: Oh god!

01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:04.107
SAM: Matt's making me feel sad for these people.

01:36:04.107 --> 01:36:07.689
MATT: This guy doesn't make his save; he's dead.

01:36:07.689 --> 01:36:11.269
LAURA: Oh god! The whole crew is dead!

01:36:11.269 --> 01:36:13.832
SAM: This is what we do to crews on ships.

01:36:13.832 --> 01:36:15.128
MATT: Roll for the barlgura.

01:36:15.128 --> 01:36:17.517
TRAVIS: Oh, it's incinerated. It had three hit
points. Even if he saves.

01:36:17.517 --> 01:36:27.404
MATT: Yeah, the barlgura is destroyed. Vera--
that's cocked.

01:36:27.404 --> 01:36:28.647
SAM: We hate seamen.

01:36:28.647 --> 01:36:38.914
MATT: That is 13, does not succeed. Vera takes 31
damage. Vera's almost dead, is burned, incinerated

01:36:38.914 --> 01:36:40.020
on the ground, not moving.

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:40.677
TRAVIS: Unconscious?

01:36:40.677 --> 01:36:42.597
TALIESIN: What happens to her concentration
spell?

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:43.614
MATT: Concentration spell's lost.

01:36:43.614 --> 01:36:47.456
TALIESIN: Do the guards now know that they were
being manipulated?

01:36:47.456 --> 01:36:51.419
MATT: It doesn't work like that, unfortunately.
But their compulsion's no longer there.

01:36:51.419 --> 01:36:54.482
LIAM: They saw the Fireball go over their heads,
yes.

01:36:54.482 --> 01:37:10.226
MATT: Yeah. With that, the spell fades. Vera
crumbles to the ground, barlgura's gone, giant

01:37:10.247 --> 01:37:17.803
explosion. The mast leans slightly to one side
from the impact. This guy was out of the radius, actually.

01:37:17.803 --> 01:37:19.537
TALIESIN: Still have to make a dex save from it,
though.

01:37:19.537 --> 01:37:22.072
MATT: I'd say if he hit the mast-- I'd say it hit
him, actually, yeah.

01:37:22.072 --> 01:37:24.302
TRAVIS: His poor feet. He's like, "Fuck!"

01:37:24.302 --> 01:37:28.619
MATT: Ipess has to make it as well. He fails, so
he gets incinerated.

01:37:28.619 --> 01:37:33.670
TRAVIS: How many life sentences are you serving,
Caleb?

01:37:33.670 --> 01:37:42.726
MATT: Ipess does make it. I need you to make a
wisdom saving throw, Caleb.

01:37:42.726 --> 01:37:44.260
LIAM: Multiple?

01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:45.974
MATT: No, the DC's real high on this one.

01:37:45.974 --> 01:37:56.613
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sure it's going to fail. This is a
wisdom? 18.

01:37:56.613 --> 01:38:05.533
MATT: As you go conscious, you watch as bodies go
flying off the side and fall limp to the side of

01:38:05.533 --> 01:38:13.673
the dock, their bodies still smoldering but
unmoving. You start flashing back to a very

01:38:13.673 --> 01:38:19.894
painful memory, and Caleb's eyes glaze over. You
are currently stunned.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:22.454
TRAVIS: What? No. Hey!

01:38:22.454 --> 01:38:30.696
MATT: Okay, that ends Caleb's turn. The guards
that were calm are no longer calm. As they see you

01:38:30.696 --> 01:38:35.577
do this, the guards that were behind you charge
in, and all grapple both of you. Are you resisting?

01:38:35.577 --> 01:38:36.753
TRAVIS: No.

01:38:36.753 --> 01:38:39.211
MATT: No, all right. You are dogpiled and
grappled.

01:38:39.211 --> 01:38:44.116
SAM: Oh god. Are we giving up?

01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:46.958
TRAVIS: Let me see. Yeah!

01:38:46.958 --> 01:38:50.187
SAM: There's only six or seven of them. We're
super powerful.

01:38:50.187 --> 01:38:53.766
TRAVIS: I've got crazy spells after the next short
rest.

01:38:53.766 --> 01:38:59.712
MATT: All right. Damn.

01:38:59.712 --> 01:39:04.014
TRAVIS: Ain't no stretch of time I ain't ever done
that could break a man.

01:39:06.779 --> 01:39:13.945
MATT: Ipess looks around at the destroyed crew,
saw Vera go down, and runs up to try and see how

01:39:13.945 --> 01:39:23.251
she's doing. The remaining crew, which is just the
one here, and this one here.

01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:29.589
LAURA: Is Bouldergut still alive?

01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:33.308
MATT: Bouldergut's still alive, barely. Barely.

01:39:33.308 --> 01:39:36.341
TRAVIS: I think Avantika thinks that Bouldergut
had the book. Would the book have taken the

01:39:36.341 --> 01:39:38.425
Fireball damage?

01:39:38.425 --> 01:39:44.637
MATT: Currently the book's still in her hands.
There was no variation in that.

01:39:44.637 --> 01:39:45.637
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:39:45.637 --> 01:39:52.715
MATT: The book is still held there in her hand.
Okay, that's going to end the crew's turn. Coming

01:39:52.715 --> 01:39:57.127
back to you, Beauregard, as you're just waiting.
You keep waiting?

01:39:57.537 --> 01:40:02.694
MARISHA: I tell the guards standing next to me,
because I'm assuming they saw the explosion of the

01:40:02.694 --> 01:40:10.223
Fireball, I'm going to say: More people die with
each passing moment. Will you at least walk with

01:40:10.223 --> 01:40:13.979
me? Time is of the essence here.

01:40:15.179 --> 01:40:18.753
MATT: "Don't do anything funny." They turn around
and start walking with you.

01:40:18.753 --> 01:40:21.466
LIAM: That's a good deal. Yes, yes, yes!

01:40:21.466 --> 01:40:25.115
MARISHA: I power walk like a grandma at a mall.

01:40:25.556 --> 01:40:27.797
MATT: They're (grunting), trying to keep up a
bit.

01:40:27.797 --> 01:40:29.547
MARISHA: It's 9:00am, the doors just opened!

01:40:29.547 --> 01:40:33.419
TRAVIS: Those sweet all-white New Balance.

01:40:33.419 --> 01:40:36.729
MARISHA: Got my insoles!

01:40:36.729 --> 01:40:48.981
MATT: Avantika takes a quick glance at the
scenario, and opens the hatch and charges inside

01:40:48.981 --> 01:40:51.397
of her ship.

01:40:51.397 --> 01:40:53.256
TALIESIN: What's she got in there?

01:40:53.256 --> 01:40:54.632
SAM: Dildos.

01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:56.312
LAURA: Just a big shipment of dildos.

01:40:56.312 --> 01:40:57.694
TRAVIS: She does.

01:40:57.694 --> 01:41:01.351
(laughter)

01:41:04.506 --> 01:41:09.109
MATT: At this point, unless anyone's going to
resist, combat comes to an end and we are now at a

01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:17.035
role playing point. At that moment, we'll take a
break. Unless you were doing anything?

01:41:17.035 --> 01:41:18.036
TRAVIS: Are you resisting?

01:41:18.036 --> 01:41:21.433
SAM: I'm running. I'm not going back to jail!

01:41:21.433 --> 01:41:23.878
MATT: We'll take a break in a second, then.

01:41:23.878 --> 01:41:25.163
TRAVIS: I'm never going back!

01:41:25.163 --> 01:41:27.022
MATT: Because when it gets to Nott's turn--

01:41:27.022 --> 01:41:29.117
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to bolt.

01:41:29.117 --> 01:41:36.149
MATT: Okay. If that's the case, there are four
guards now. No, because now two of them have

01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:39.514
changed direction to go towards you and help
subdue you guys. There's two after you now.

01:41:39.514 --> 01:41:43.271
They're both going to attempt to grapple you and
stop you. Make two acrobatics checks.

01:41:43.271 --> 01:41:47.998
SAM: Not great. Ten.

01:41:47.998 --> 01:41:49.760
MATT: Ten on the first one.

01:41:50.096 --> 01:41:51.595
SAM: 17.

01:41:51.595 --> 01:41:53.008
MATT: Both fail, actually.

01:41:53.008 --> 01:41:54.688
SAM: Oh, they both got me?

01:41:54.688 --> 01:41:56.188
MATT: Yeah, that was a 12 and an 18.

01:41:56.188 --> 01:41:59.181
SAM: Who are these guards? I wasn't next to
anybody!

01:41:59.181 --> 01:42:02.250
MATT: This was as you were charging through there,
and on their turn they moved up to you.

01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:04.696
TRAVIS: They played sports when they were younger.
They're really dextrous.

01:42:04.696 --> 01:42:13.515
MATT: Your movement's zero, you can't escape.
We'll say that happened on their turn, so on the

01:42:13.515 --> 01:42:16.095
beginning of your turn, you're grappled. You can
attempt to break free if you want to.

01:42:16.095 --> 01:42:17.789
SAM: From one of them.

01:42:17.789 --> 01:42:22.053
MATT: Actually, that's an interesting point. Let
me pull up my new, fancy Player's Handbook.

01:42:22.053 --> 01:42:23.007
ALL: Ooh!

01:42:23.007 --> 01:42:23.663
SAM: What is that?

01:42:23.663 --> 01:42:25.458
LIAM: It's their new limited edition.

01:42:25.458 --> 01:42:28.842
MARISHA: It's a box set. It's so fucking hot.

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:34.149
MATT: Unintentional commercial, but these are so
awesome.

01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:37.810
TALIESIN: Oh my god, it's too pretty.

01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:40.330
MATT: I think they're brick-and-mortar only, so
you've got to go to actual game stores.

01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:48.125
MARISHA: Go to your local game stores. Support
small businesses!

01:42:48.466 --> 01:42:51.894
TALIESIN: You'll see me at a game store. I don't
know which one, but I'll be there.

01:42:51.894 --> 01:42:56.426
LIAM: A thousand years of D&amp;amp;D!

01:42:56.426 --> 01:42:58.937
MARISHA: When are you going to be rich, son?

01:42:58.937 --> 01:43:02.706
TALIESIN: D&amp;amp;D. &amp;amp;D.

01:43:04.679 --> 01:43:09.855
MATT: It doesn't say. I'll say make a check and
we'll see if it's high enough for each of them.

01:43:09.855 --> 01:43:13.087
SAM: It's not. It's a two.

01:43:13.087 --> 01:43:20.433
MATT: No. They hold tight, you can't move. Your
movement's zero. They're both clutching you there

01:43:20.433 --> 01:43:22.136
on the side.

01:43:22.136 --> 01:43:25.072
SAM: (sighs) I relent.

01:43:25.072 --> 01:43:30.214
MATT: Okay. With the chaos now coming to a stop,
and Nott prevented from escaping, though that

01:43:30.214 --> 01:43:33.114
would have been a fun chase sequence, now we'll go
to a break.

01:43:33.114 --> 01:43:39.435
LIAM: Matt, we have played this game for hundreds
of hours together. That was two of the best hours

01:43:39.435 --> 01:43:42.443
of this game ever! That was so much fun.

01:43:42.443 --> 01:43:44.275
MATT: Man, that was really intense.

01:43:44.275 --> 01:43:45.733
TRAVIS: Did we turn it on its head for you?

01:43:45.733 --> 01:43:49.774
MATT: Oh, there was a few things there that went
differently than I expected!

01:43:49.774 --> 01:43:54.484
TALIESIN: I was having so much Treasure Island
flashes. That's one of my favorite books, and it's

01:43:54.484 --> 01:43:57.734
like all of this is so good! All of it's so good!

01:43:57.734 --> 01:44:02.549
MATT: Before we go to the break, we have our
fantastic giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood,

01:44:02.549 --> 01:44:06.705
who are giving away this leather-inset zebrawood
dice tray.

01:44:06.705 --> 01:44:11.848
MARISHA: That's the one I got. It's so pretty.

01:44:11.848 --> 01:44:17.224
MATT: To join the contest, you have to go and jump
over to the Critical Role Twitch chat, that's at

01:44:17.224 --> 01:44:27.386
twitch.tv/criticalrole, during the break, and
enter the keyword "fire." Only enter it once, more

01:44:27.386 --> 01:44:31.088
than once and you'll be disqualified. Once again,
unfortunately, only the US and Canada, excluding

01:44:31.088 --> 01:44:34.718
Quebec. We'll have a winner for you at the end of
the break. See you guys then.

01:44:34.719 --> 01:44:38.840
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. Before we
go in, we have our winner of our fantastic

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:45.053
Wyrmwood dice tray, zebrawood dice tray. The
winner is WonderfulMouse. Congratulations,

01:44:45.053 --> 01:44:48.804
WonderfulMouse! We'll get that sent to you ASAP.

01:44:48.804 --> 01:44:51.155
MARISHA: So cute.

01:44:51.155 --> 01:45:00.744
MATT: Diving back in. As the rest of you stand
there amongst the shipyard docks, subdued by the

01:45:00.744 --> 01:45:07.242
harbor watch, The Revelry watch there. More
gather, and more gather, I'd say about half the

01:45:07.242 --> 01:45:11.450
watch of this city, the volunteer mercenaries that
take their shifts to keep their eye on their

01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:17.099
island, little haven there, all flood the docks to
see what the hell just went down. You look up and

01:45:17.099 --> 01:45:22.721
see the blackened, charred sails of the ship,
treated against weathering, but still darkened

01:45:22.721 --> 01:45:28.775
from the blast of the fireball, the wood itself
darkened and splintered in places. You can see

01:45:28.775 --> 01:45:36.659
that giant, burned U that marks the deck.
Everything is held in place. You're making your

01:45:36.659 --> 01:45:42.299
way to the guards. What are you doing, Jester? You
see Beau being led up by the guards towards the

01:45:42.299 --> 01:45:43.715
Throne Roost.

01:45:43.715 --> 01:45:51.812
LAURA: Okay, you can do it, Beau. Do I see the big
fire explosion too, as it happens?

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:56.369
MATT: Oh yeah, you saw and heard the distant
(explosion).

01:45:56.369 --> 01:45:57.382
TALIESIN: Whitestone saw the fire.

01:45:57.382 --> 01:46:00.152
TRAVIS: (singing) Whitestone saw the fire.

01:46:00.152 --> 01:46:08.951
LAURA: Oh. Okay. I hope everyone's okay. Please,
Traveler, be with them. I'm going to start running

01:46:08.951 --> 01:46:12.939
towards the docks in disguise.

01:46:12.939 --> 01:46:19.263
MATT: Okay. The guards have now pulled you all to
your feet, and have begun to apply manacles to

01:46:19.263 --> 01:46:27.390
your hands. Not anything too aggressive, but for
the purpose of safety and to maintain the order

01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:35.121
within this community, they're particular and
careful. They also go onto the deck, and you see

01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:43.773
them beginning to collect the bodies of those that
were killed. Bouldergut is inconsolable and

01:46:43.773 --> 01:46:51.845
furious, and it takes a few guards to get her to
calm down. Avantika is having a conversation with

01:46:51.845 --> 01:47:00.602
a couple of the guards. You guys are being pulled
away from the docks, towards the city. As you are

01:47:00.602 --> 01:47:07.185
brought towards the edge of it, one of the guards,
adorned a little better than the rest, have a

01:47:07.185 --> 01:47:15.768
brief discussion. You overhear one of them say,
"Hold tight, apparently someone's going to get the

01:47:15.792 --> 01:47:24.018
"Plank King." While you guys are all waiting, and
you're going to convene with the rest of your troupe--

01:47:24.018 --> 01:47:26.255
LAURA: I'm not going to join them.

01:47:26.255 --> 01:47:27.808
MATT: But go and find the vicinity.

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:28.897
LAURA: See what's going on, yeah.

01:47:28.897 --> 01:47:34.211
MATT: There are many looky-loos on the edges of
the shipyards here. The docks make up probably a

01:47:34.211 --> 01:47:40.482
good third of Darktow. Before you actually get the
edge of the cliff where the city itself is built

01:47:40.482 --> 01:47:45.950
on different areas and platforms, and the streets
all rise at a perpetual grade, as it is embedded

01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:51.345
in the side of the cliff. There are folks who are
looking over to see what happened. Usually this

01:47:51.345 --> 01:47:56.432
kind of stuff does not go down within the city.
You can see that people are excited, and worried,

01:47:56.432 --> 01:48:00.358
and making up their own stories, and what they
saw. One of them is like, "It was crazy! A demon

01:48:00.358 --> 01:48:06.951
"fell from the sky and slammed into the boat and it
was intense!" The rumors are going crazy.

01:48:06.951 --> 01:48:08.687
MARISHA: It was a Gwar concert.

01:48:08.687 --> 01:48:13.206
MATT: That's a 7th-level spell, Summon Gwar
Concert.

01:48:13.206 --> 01:48:18.031
LAURA: (old man voice) Did Avantika finally do it?
Did she finally do it?

01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:19.229
SAM: She's still trying?

01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:22.247
LAURA: I always heard that she was going to stage
a coup. Did she finally stage one?

01:48:22.247 --> 01:48:25.577
(laughter)

01:48:25.577 --> 01:48:31.128
TALIESIN: If I can take ten minutes of this time
sitting manacled to cast Prayer-- if enough of us

01:48:31.128 --> 01:48:32.769
are within 30 feet of each other right now.

01:48:32.769 --> 01:48:37.629
MATT: You can probably all-- they do round you up.
However, as soon as you begin to make any physical

01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:39.166
action towards spellcasting--

01:48:39.166 --> 01:48:40.137
TALIESIN: It's all vocal.

01:48:40.137 --> 01:48:41.089
MATT: It's only verbal?

01:48:41.089 --> 01:48:44.277
TALIESIN: It's only verbal. And I tell them.

01:48:44.277 --> 01:48:46.683
MATT: You tell them you're going to cast a spell?

01:48:46.683 --> 01:48:49.759
TALIESIN: I'm going to be healing everybody. It's
a thing that I--

01:48:49.759 --> 01:48:51.257
MATT: "No spellcasting."

01:48:51.257 --> 01:48:53.649
TALIESIN: (loud sigh)

01:48:53.649 --> 01:48:55.570
MATT: "Don't want any funny stuff."

01:48:55.570 --> 01:48:57.561
TALIESIN: All right, that's fine.

01:48:57.561 --> 01:48:58.870
SAM: Have they taken our weapons?

01:48:58.870 --> 01:49:04.017
MATT: They have, after manacling, taken your
weapons. The individuals are carrying them at

01:49:04.017 --> 01:49:06.235
their side. Not yours. They couldn't find yours.

01:49:06.235 --> 01:49:08.041
TRAVIS: I wonder why.

01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:16.504
MATT: They have your crossbow, and they've taken
your shield and your staff.

01:49:16.504 --> 01:49:22.377
LAURA: Am I within range of everybody? Could I be
in the crowd, but near everyone?

01:49:22.499 --> 01:49:28.512
(laughter)

01:49:28.512 --> 01:49:32.969
MATT: There is a small perimeter being held, but
you could get probably within 20, 25 feet or so of them.

01:49:32.969 --> 01:49:37.549
LAURA: Then, if I'm within 30 feet, I'm going to
cast Prayer of Healing on my buds.

01:49:37.549 --> 01:49:38.777
MATT: Okay.

01:49:38.777 --> 01:49:41.259
MARISHA: What? On your buds?

01:49:41.259 --> 01:49:42.485
LAURA: On my buddies!

01:49:42.485 --> 01:49:49.506
MATT: Make a performance check to see how subtly
you can-- no, this would be deception. Make a deception.

01:49:49.506 --> 01:49:51.173
LAURA: A deception check. Okay.

01:49:51.173 --> 01:49:52.581
TRAVIS: Come on.

01:49:52.581 --> 01:49:59.910
LAURA: Eight. Well, I hope those people are going to be
okay. They look like they're pretty hurt up in

01:49:59.968 --> 01:50:04.561
there. Some of them look like they're bloody. That
one looks burned.

01:50:04.561 --> 01:50:07.992
MATT: As you begin to subtly try and sneak your
verbal components of your spell into the

01:50:07.992 --> 01:50:13.987
discussion, one of the guards goes: "Hey! Sorry,
we're making sure there's no casting this close to

01:50:13.987 --> 01:50:16.838
"it, if you don't mind."

01:50:16.838 --> 01:50:21.192
LAURA: Makes sense. I just saw some were hurt. I
was trying to help out, but if they don't want it,

01:50:21.192 --> 01:50:22.709
then I ain't going to do it.

01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:25.890
MATT: "It's best not to get involved. Terribly
sorry about that."

01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:28.384
SAM: I want to hear more!

01:50:28.384 --> 01:50:30.019
MATT: Nah, that's it.

01:50:30.019 --> 01:50:32.989
LIAM: No! It was so good!

01:50:32.989 --> 01:50:35.096
TALIESIN: This is what you get for Counterspell.

01:50:35.096 --> 01:50:41.764
MATT: He's telling everyone, "Please, hold tight.
Don't worry. We're taking care of it."

01:50:41.764 --> 01:50:47.614
TALIESIN: It's just a cheek caress, then gone. Not
even a kiss goodnight.

01:50:47.614 --> 01:50:54.554
MATT: Anyway, about 30 or so minutes pass for the
rest of you. As make your way up the steps now,

01:50:54.554 --> 01:51:01.894
trying to jaunt, you manage to catch up to the
armored fellow, who now acts as the tip of the

01:51:01.894 --> 01:51:06.719
spear, essentially. Now you're flanked and to the
front, although the flanking has to shift as the

01:51:06.719 --> 01:51:12.021
space for the steps ascending to the Throne Roost
get only wide for one person at a time. You are

01:51:12.021 --> 01:51:19.868
being held at that point. You make your way up to
the Throne Roost, to the shelf of stone. There you

01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:26.147
see, standing at the edge, is the Plank King
himself, blackened curls still dangling around his

01:51:26.235 --> 01:51:32.092
massive goliath head, his long coat billowing
slightly with the bit of wind that's whipping

01:51:32.092 --> 01:51:41.751
around the side of the cliff face. The morning fog
is burning off of the nearby reefs, and you can

01:51:41.751 --> 01:51:49.435
see a little bit further out. The sky itself is
still dull gray. Looks over and goes, "That was

01:51:49.435 --> 01:51:57.459
"quite the display, wouldn't you say?" The guard
goes, "Right, sir. One of them, we found at least

01:51:57.459 --> 01:52:03.196
"someone running from the bit who says they have
information for you." He goes, "Oh yeah, no, I

01:52:03.196 --> 01:52:05.700
"recognize this one. Step forward."

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.568
MARISHA: 'Sup?

01:52:07.568 --> 01:52:11.452
MATT: "So what's all this?"

01:52:11.452 --> 01:52:16.588
MARISHA: What, the display you just saw, or this?

01:52:16.588 --> 01:52:19.895
MATT: "If you don't mind, tell me what's going
on."

01:52:19.895 --> 01:52:25.336
MARISHA: I think you just won the lottery, friend.
I toss him the book.

01:52:25.336 --> 01:52:32.475
MATT: He flips through the pages. "This is
gibberish."

01:52:32.475 --> 01:52:37.586
MARISHA: I know. Luckily, one of our crew members
is smart enough, and he deciphered the whole

01:52:37.586 --> 01:52:43.110
thing. In there you'll find everything you need to
know about the coup that Avantika has been

01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:52.802
planning. Whispers about wanting to rule the sea.
She has been worshipping an outer-worldly being

01:52:52.802 --> 01:52:57.037
called Uk'otoa, left over from the Betrayer Gods.

01:52:57.986 --> 01:53:03.390
MATT: He glances through the paperwork, looks at
you giving him this sly grin, and goes, "You,

01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:13.661
"newcomer into these waters, spent less than a day
amongst our people and have already attacked and

01:53:13.661 --> 01:53:15.511
"stolen from one of our own, as well."

01:53:15.511 --> 01:53:18.363
MARISHA: I didn't attack; she attacked us first.

01:53:18.363 --> 01:53:26.071
MATT: "Well, we'll see what she has to say to
defend herself, as well. Hang tight with me here,

01:53:26.071 --> 01:53:31.607
"with these men. The rest of you, get the rest of
your guard. Bring her friends, and bring Avantika

01:53:31.607 --> 01:53:35.558
"and who else had survived that massacre up here to
the roost."

01:53:35.558 --> 01:53:40.617
MARISHA: You're going to trust the things that she
says? You'll see a U burned into the deck of the ship.

01:53:40.617 --> 01:53:45.589
MATT: "I don't trust anyone, and I trust more
those that I've mistrusted for years than those

01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:54.224
"I've only come to mistrust and know right now. So
we'll see where it all lies. Be patient. If what

01:53:54.224 --> 01:53:57.890
"you say is true, then we've got all time in the
day."

01:53:57.890 --> 01:53:59.405
MARISHA: You have time to read that book right
now?

01:53:59.405 --> 01:54:03.694
MATT: "I don't read a fucking piece of this, but
I've got a few friends who are more of a

01:54:03.694 --> 01:54:06.019
"page-turning type."

01:54:06.019 --> 01:54:09.990
MARISHA: Hey, you came to me, though. Why?

01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:16.480
MATT: "Because I wanted to see if you'd actually
do something. Remember, we don't turn on pirates here."

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.675
MARISHA: What do I get when I'm right?

01:54:21.675 --> 01:54:25.708
MATT: "If you're right, then I'll judge you based
on the fact that you broke our law as soon as you

01:54:25.708 --> 01:54:32.224
"got here, and I'll weigh it versus how positive
this tells me. There's not enough, well, maybe you

01:54:32.224 --> 01:54:36.220
"and Avantika will find yourselves out there on a
pike of warning."

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:40.086
MARISHA: How about we strike a deal right now?
Because when you go down there, you're going to

01:54:40.086 --> 01:54:45.877
see murdered crew mates and a U burned into the
deck of that ship from where she was trying to

01:54:45.877 --> 01:54:49.484
summon Uk'otoa.

01:54:49.902 --> 01:54:52.604
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:54:52.604 --> 01:54:55.137
SAM and LAURA: Oh god.

01:54:55.137 --> 01:55:00.640
LIAM: (whispers) You crazy motherfucker.

01:55:01.405 --> 01:55:02.927
MARISHA: 17.

01:55:02.927 --> 01:55:07.620
MATT: Okay. He nods a bit.

01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:11.394
MARISHA: So if you think you can trust anything
that she says before you get into the details of

01:55:11.394 --> 01:55:17.040
that book, details that we've already deciphered,
as we've been on the seas with her for quite some

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:21.210
time, and the betrayal that we have seen.

01:55:21.210 --> 01:55:26.036
MATT: "So's this one." He snaps his fingers, and
you see a cloaked figure step out of the shadows,

01:55:26.036 --> 01:55:29.025
the same cloak that passed you on the stairs the
night before.

01:55:29.025 --> 01:55:30.254
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

01:55:30.254 --> 01:55:31.349
LAURA: Is it Jamedi?

01:55:31.349 --> 01:55:33.495
MATT: It's Jamedi, hood pulled back.

01:55:33.495 --> 01:55:36.025
SAM: Is he with us?

01:55:36.025 --> 01:55:37.601
LAURA: I like Jamedi.

01:55:37.601 --> 01:55:39.234
TRAVIS: Jamedi does not like her.

01:55:39.234 --> 01:55:44.104
MATT: At which point, the Plank King steps up
towards you, now looming over you, a good two and

01:55:44.104 --> 01:55:50.883
a half feet of height on you. This imposing
presence, wide like a mountain, glancing down at

01:55:50.883 --> 01:55:55.689
you with a grin. You can smell his early morning
breath of rotting teeth and whatever he had the

01:55:55.689 --> 01:56:05.831
night before pulsing from his grin. He goes, "I
have to say, for someone so small, you've got some

01:56:05.831 --> 01:56:07.364
"serious balls."

01:56:09.099 --> 01:56:12.049
MARISHA: Thanks. That's not the first time I've
heard that.

01:56:12.049 --> 01:56:18.730
MATT: "And if you survive, I'm sure it won't be
the last. All right. Let's go see your friends."

01:56:18.730 --> 01:56:28.696
MARISHA: Hey! I want a boat, and safe passage out
if we're correct.

01:56:28.696 --> 01:56:36.509
MATT: "If this is right, let's hope you didn't
blow up too much of her boat; it'll be yours."

01:56:36.509 --> 01:56:39.156
MARISHA: Deal.

01:56:39.156 --> 01:56:43.032
MATT: "If it's enough."

01:56:43.032 --> 01:56:48.759
TRAVIS: Oh god. (choking)

01:56:48.759 --> 01:56:52.242
MATT: The guards now turn and spin you around and
push you back down the stairs as the Plank King

01:56:52.242 --> 01:56:58.823
follows behind, Jamedi keeping a close watch. He
goes and shouts something off to the side. He

01:56:58.823 --> 01:57:06.323
goes, "Solon! I'm going to need your brain for
this one. Come on." You hear a voice go, "All

01:57:06.323 --> 01:57:07.557
"right, I'm coming."

01:57:07.557 --> 01:57:09.958
LIAM and TRAVIS: Solon?

01:57:09.958 --> 01:57:18.850
MATT: Solon. S-O-L-O-N. Coming around the corner,
you see a human man, probably in his late 50s,

01:57:18.850 --> 01:57:28.448
early 60s. Bit of an unkept puff of a chin goatee,
his hair thinning in this big widow's peak, gray

01:57:28.448 --> 01:57:39.549
to white. These big spectacles around his eyes,
and this tattered, thin mustache that's attempted

01:57:39.549 --> 01:57:45.476
to be curled into a handlebar, but it seems to
have split in places and is not very well kept. He

01:57:45.476 --> 01:57:51.265
has this big, green cloak that's wrapped around
his shoulders that is so much material and

01:57:51.265 --> 01:57:56.621
billowing so widely, it makes his head
comparatively look much smaller. He's clutching a

01:57:56.621 --> 01:58:01.619
bag, and he's getting his stuff. "Wait here, I'm
getting my stuff. Ugh!" They keep walking, and

01:58:01.619 --> 01:58:06.516
eventually you see him trying to catch up from
behind. (panting) You take it this was probably

01:58:06.516 --> 01:58:09.857
what the Plank King was referring to as his
bookish friend.

01:58:09.857 --> 01:58:11.228
TRAVIS: You think?

01:58:11.228 --> 01:58:12.670
LIAM: Yeah.

01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:15.621
TRAVIS: He's the fighter.

01:58:17.635 --> 01:58:21.661
MATT: As you guys are all patiently waiting here,
looking amongst yourselves, is there anything you

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:30.369
wish to do, or are you succumbing to the hope that
Jester, Beauregard, and/or possibly the Plank King

01:58:30.369 --> 01:58:34.934
comes to situate this? Eventually, you see
Avantika brought up from the ship in manacles, as well.

01:58:34.934 --> 01:58:39.306
LIAM: Well, I've noticed that they're not letting
any of us cast anything, correct?

01:58:39.306 --> 01:58:41.406
MATT: No, they shut that down.

01:58:41.406 --> 01:58:44.032
LIAM: Then no. I would do Mage Armor, but no.

01:58:44.032 --> 01:58:46.768
TALIESIN: This is basically a short rest? Is this
what this is?

01:58:46.768 --> 01:58:48.485
MATT: It's not quite long enough to be a short
rest.

01:58:48.485 --> 01:58:49.491
LIAM: Motherfucker.

01:58:49.491 --> 01:58:51.192
TRAVIS: I know, I was going to say the same
thing.

01:58:51.192 --> 01:58:54.861
MATT: Actually, you know what? No, it's about an
hour of short rest. I give that to you.

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:55.909
TRAVIS: Bless you, Mercer.

01:58:55.909 --> 01:58:58.285
MATT: For the travel of Beau to the front, and the
rest of the guard to get there; for the Plank King

01:58:58.285 --> 01:59:01.040
conversation; for him to descend the Throne Roost
to make his way through the city to the docks;

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:02.275
yeah, that's over an hour.

01:59:02.275 --> 01:59:07.529
LIAM: Then in these circumstances, I would dismiss
Frumpkin from the Material Plane and bring him

01:59:07.529 --> 01:59:10.364
back on my shoulder, so he's with me.

01:59:10.364 --> 01:59:17.254
MATT: Okay. As Frumpkin appears on the shoulder,
one of the watch goes, "Oh, where'd you come from,

01:59:17.254 --> 01:59:21.934
"little one? Didn't even see you come in." Begins
scritching Frumpkin.

01:59:21.934 --> 01:59:25.297
LIAM: He's friendly. That's my pet cat.

01:59:25.297 --> 01:59:28.987
MATT: Doesn't even talk to you. Just looks at
Frumpkin. "Who's a cute little kitty? We don't get

01:59:28.987 --> 01:59:32.977
"cats much on this island. It's good to see one.
Wonder what ship you came aboard?"

01:59:32.977 --> 01:59:36.760
(laughter)

01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:38.991
LIAM: I'm thinking really bad thoughts.

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:48.936
MATT: Eventually, as the crowd begins to part, you
see a number of the guard, a few of the bodyguards

01:59:48.936 --> 01:59:53.533
that you had seen previously sitting amongst the
shadows of the Throne Roost when you first arrived

01:59:53.533 --> 02:00:01.676
the night before. You guys came roaring into this
town; you definitely did. There you see Beauregard

02:00:01.676 --> 02:00:09.133
being flanked by three guards, one better-armored
than the others, and then there, stepping behind

02:00:09.133 --> 02:00:21.061
that, the looming figure of the Plank King. He
approaches. "So not here but 24 hours and you've

02:00:21.061 --> 02:00:29.307
"already made a mess of our little home, have you?
I could see the flames from my Roost. My crow's

02:00:29.307 --> 02:00:35.928
"men tell me they spotted you walking aboard the
Squalleater and assault Avantika, one of our own.

02:00:35.928 --> 02:00:44.770
"Apparently a few of you fleeing into the city. You
know I have my misgivings about trusting anyone,

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:50.773
"but I'm far more likely to toss in with those that
I've mistrusted long enough to at least know where

02:00:50.773 --> 02:01:01.785
"they stand. I don't know a fucking bit about all
of you. So my other friend--" and he points

02:01:01.785 --> 02:01:09.570
towards Jamedi, who's now in the back, and the
rest of you see, "-- says that you've all come in

02:01:09.729 --> 02:01:16.233
"with her lot naught but maybe two weeks back, and
that not most of you have much of an experience on

02:01:16.233 --> 02:01:26.079
"the sea, naught but one. The rest of you still
haven't quite found your legs on the waters. I'm

02:01:26.079 --> 02:01:35.949
"going to ask you right now, what brought you out
there, to mucking with the pirates' deals? Speak up!"

02:01:36.846 --> 02:01:44.717
TRAVIS: We understand your distrust. We are new
here, and we only beg your patience as we prove

02:01:44.717 --> 02:01:54.328
ourselves before you. Avantika and her crew were
up to foul deeds. Our friend Beau here, I trust,

02:01:54.328 --> 02:02:00.252
has shown you her journal.

02:02:01.339 --> 02:02:06.346
MATT: He reaches back in his pocket and goes, "Oh,
right. Here," and gives it to Solon, who goes,

02:02:06.346 --> 02:02:13.049
"Oh, all right. This is not a language I really
know--"

02:02:13.049 --> 02:02:14.589
MARISHA: There's a cipher in the front.

02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:15.400
MATT: "Oh, yeah."

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:16.953
LIAM: Yeah, it's wedged into the back page.

02:02:16.953 --> 02:02:20.780
MATT: He takes it and pulls it out, looks at it.
"Oh, fuck me, this is--"

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:23.231
MARISHA: Yeah, it's pretty good work, right?

02:02:24.184 --> 02:02:29.737
MATT: "Sir, with all due respect, it's going to
take me a long while to do this. This is elaborate."

02:02:29.737 --> 02:02:32.746
MARISHA: I told you, yeah.

02:02:33.086 --> 02:02:37.691
TALIESIN: I think there's already some work that
can be checked, if that speeds it up. I mean, that

02:02:37.691 --> 02:02:38.839
should be--

02:02:38.839 --> 02:02:40.155
MATT: The Plank King goes, "Shh."

02:02:40.155 --> 02:02:42.658
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

02:02:42.658 --> 02:02:48.595
MATT: "You said there's some special parts here,
of looking to overturn me or something? What pages

02:02:48.655 --> 02:02:50.524
"are that at?"

02:02:50.524 --> 02:02:55.928
LIAM: Excuse me, I am the one who deciphered this.
That is near the end.

02:02:55.928 --> 02:02:57.984
MARISHA: He's our Solon.

02:02:58.346 --> 02:03:03.298
MATT: Solon goes, "Oh! I'd very much like to have
a conversation with you."

02:03:03.298 --> 02:03:08.935
LIAM: As you will, if that is welcome here, but
yeah. The bit about her being a traitor to the

02:03:08.935 --> 02:03:16.572
Plank King, and wanting to rule over the entire
sea, and have the Plank King-- I believe the words

02:03:16.572 --> 02:03:24.144
are, if I remember correctly, because my memory is
spotty, "bend the knee."

02:03:24.144 --> 02:03:25.762
MATT: You point out the space where that was.

02:03:25.762 --> 02:03:27.520
LIAM: Is near the end, ja, right here.

02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:28.961
MATT: Thumbs through, and he goes--

02:03:28.961 --> 02:03:29.715
LIAM: It's complex.

02:03:29.715 --> 02:03:38.357
MATT: "Okay. O great king, give me a bit of time
with this, if you don't mind?" He looks around.

02:03:38.357 --> 02:03:43.990
Everyone's looking at him. At this moment he
glances around and sees the dozens and dozens of

02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:47.220
eyes locked on him, and he starts getting a little
nervous. You see a little sweat drop on his

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:51.591
forehead, and he adjusts his glasses again.
They're starting to fog a bit. He goes, (clears

02:03:51.591 --> 02:03:55.728
throat), plops down, and starts going through, and
pulls out paper and a quill. He sets up in the

02:03:55.728 --> 02:04:00.375
middle of the dock area and starts going through
and point-by-point deciphering and translating

02:04:00.375 --> 02:04:04.043
each part of the cipher over to one of his empty
pages.

02:04:04.043 --> 02:04:07.136
TRAVIS: Great king, if we may, time we have.

02:04:07.136 --> 02:04:09.085
MATT: "That we do."

02:04:09.085 --> 02:04:16.377
TRAVIS: It's at your whim that we serve. I think
it would be only fair to ask that we remain under

02:04:16.377 --> 02:04:20.754
guard while your compatriot here translates that
text.

02:04:20.754 --> 02:04:22.556
MATT: "Oh, we're standing right here."

02:04:22.556 --> 02:04:24.377
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

02:04:24.377 --> 02:04:30.466
MATT: "You still haven't answered my question.
What brought you to these waters? Why'd you throw

02:04:30.466 --> 02:04:34.624
"in with her lot?" You see now, they're bringing
Avantika forward with the rest of you.

02:04:34.624 --> 02:04:44.213
MARISHA: Well, we're from Wildemount. Hired
mercenaries from the Empire. I'm with a secret

02:04:44.213 --> 02:04:57.977
order of the monks from the Cobalt Soul, known as
the Expositors. Avantika has been a person of

02:04:57.977 --> 02:05:04.288
interest that we've been wanting to investigate
for some time, and I was sent to do that. So,

02:05:04.288 --> 02:05:11.754
unfortunately, our business has nothing to do with
you fine folk here of Darktow. It only has to deal

02:05:11.754 --> 02:05:19.788
with Avantika. She's disrupted our shores enough.
We decided to investigate.

02:05:19.788 --> 02:05:22.967
MATT: "Where does your allegiance lie?"

02:05:22.967 --> 02:05:32.210
MARISHA: My allegiance is completely separate and
isolated from any persons here. My allegiance is

02:05:32.210 --> 02:05:35.726
with the Cobalt Soul.

02:05:35.726 --> 02:05:43.722
MATT: His eyes narrow. Make a deception check.
I'll say with advantage because you did drop the

02:05:43.722 --> 02:05:50.262
Cobalt Soul. In particular with the Plank King,
that has meaning.

02:05:50.262 --> 02:05:52.328
LIAM: I would like to read her as well.

02:05:52.328 --> 02:05:54.482
MATT: Insight check.

02:05:54.482 --> 02:05:55.965
LIAM: At disadvantage.

02:05:55.965 --> 02:05:57.491
MATT: Yes, for you.

02:05:57.491 --> 02:06:00.864
MARISHA: 22.

02:06:00.864 --> 02:06:05.135
MATT: The Plank King nods and goes--

02:06:05.135 --> 02:06:07.359
MARISHA: My voice is shaking. I'm so nervous.

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:08.873
LIAM: 22 for me.

02:06:08.873 --> 02:06:17.577
MATT: Yeah, you barely see through. There's a hint
of truth, and there's a hint of not so true. It's

02:06:17.577 --> 02:06:19.137
a half-truth.

02:06:19.137 --> 02:06:22.535
LIAM: Caleb sees it! Go away, Fjord! Go away!

02:06:22.535 --> 02:06:25.921
MARISHA: Mixed lies or half-truths.

02:06:25.921 --> 02:06:31.215
MATT: The Plank King nods and goes, "Ah, the
Archives. I've had some dealings."

02:06:31.215 --> 02:06:34.924
MARISHA: Hmm. So you have your library card?

02:06:34.924 --> 02:06:47.605
MATT: "Not much of a reader. But your folk have
done good work for our interests in the past. So!

02:06:47.605 --> 02:06:54.281
"It's the woman of the hour. What have you to say
about yourself when these strangers have come

02:06:54.281 --> 02:06:59.118
"waltzing into our little haven and causing all
sorts of ruckus. Murdering your crew and making

02:06:59.118 --> 02:07:10.599
"these claims against you. Known you for years."
Avantika, hand behind in shackles goes, "Well."

02:07:10.599 --> 02:07:19.003
Her face, you can see bits where dirt, sweat lines
have made their way across and down the sides of

02:07:19.003 --> 02:07:25.589
her chin and jaw. Looking intently at the rest of
you with a forced smile through her teeth, there

02:07:25.596 --> 02:07:33.370
is a look of murderous rage and loss in her eyes,
as you have murdered a majority of her crew. She

02:07:33.425 --> 02:07:44.569
goes, "Well, I can guarantee that I kept no
journal. They came to me at sea with discussion of

02:07:44.569 --> 02:07:53.671
"perhaps coming and joining my crew, looking for
means of aid and gold. They began to talk of this

02:07:53.671 --> 02:08:06.710
"strange entity, this Uk'otoa. Well, I followed
suit. I wanted to make for some kind of alliance.

02:08:06.710 --> 02:08:13.441
"I found particular interest with one of their
individuals." She looks over towards Fjord, "But

02:08:13.441 --> 02:08:20.206
"it seems such a romance was merely just another
way to try and toss me to the proverbial wolves,

02:08:20.206 --> 02:08:28.895
"or merrow if it will. They've now killed my crew.
They've taken a number of my things, damaged my

02:08:28.895 --> 02:08:37.425
"ship, and they're trying to smear my name. One who
has walked alongside you and all of you fine, fine

02:08:37.425 --> 02:08:44.847
"folks for the past ten years! Even using the
memory of Vandren against me." You hear a few

02:08:44.847 --> 02:08:55.083
voices go like, (murmuring) "Vandren." "Vandren
raised this one and he sabotaged his ship. Blew it

02:08:55.083 --> 02:09:01.583
"asunder in the middle of the ocean. That was the
last he was seen. He's already killed one of our

02:09:01.583 --> 02:09:05.797
"own. Is this untrue?"

02:09:05.797 --> 02:09:08.138
TRAVIS: (stuttering) Is she talking to me?

02:09:08.138 --> 02:09:08.834
MATT: Yeah.

02:09:08.834 --> 02:09:13.986
LAURA: From the crowd, I'm going to go: She's
lying! We always knew she had it in for the Plank King!

02:09:13.986 --> 02:09:18.250
MATT: Someone goes, "Shh!" All eyes are on you.

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:23.295
TRAVIS: Plank King, if I may. My ears, though
pointy, can only stand a certain amount of

02:09:23.295 --> 02:09:29.781
dishonesty. I would prefer to cut through the
bull. There are those of us among us who can make

02:09:29.781 --> 02:09:38.119
sure that the truth is spoken here. I would beg of
you to allow that to happen now.

02:09:38.119 --> 02:09:40.764
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:09:44.524 --> 02:09:45.954
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:09:45.954 --> 02:09:55.616
(cheering)

02:09:55.616 --> 02:10:02.272
MATT: The Plank King gives you this very severe
look. His eyes narrowed and glancing you up and

02:10:02.345 --> 02:10:10.689
down, almost piercing you with but a glance. He
raises his hand with a grin and goes, "Oh. What's

02:10:10.689 --> 02:10:12.972
"necessary for such a thing?"

02:10:12.972 --> 02:10:14.964
TRAVIS: (whispering) Who has that shit?

02:10:14.964 --> 02:10:17.692
MARISHA: I do and Jester does.

02:10:17.692 --> 02:10:19.208
TRAVIS: You do?

02:10:19.208 --> 02:10:24.361
MARISHA: Yeah. It takes me literally punching the
shit out of Avantika though.

02:10:25.694 --> 02:10:33.655
TRAVIS: Honorable Plank King, the means justify
the ends. My compatriot here will place her Cobalt

02:10:33.655 --> 02:10:38.716
knuckles upon the chin of Avantika and you will
hear the truth. You need but only ask your

02:10:38.716 --> 02:10:41.606
questions again.

02:10:41.606 --> 02:10:48.444
MATT: "Be my guest." Avantika is like, "What
is--"

02:10:48.444 --> 02:10:49.921
MARISHA: Before she-- (double punch)

02:10:49.921 --> 02:10:53.115
(laughter)

02:10:53.115 --> 02:10:57.215
MATT: She's manacled and being held by two guards
from behind. It's auto-hit.

02:10:57.215 --> 02:10:58.284
LIAM: Holy shit.

02:10:58.284 --> 02:10:59.907
MARISHA: Go for the temple.

02:10:59.907 --> 02:11:01.355
MATT: Do you have a ki point left?

02:11:01.355 --> 02:11:06.825
MARISHA: Yeah, I have all of my ki points left.
More or less. All but one. Yep.

02:11:06.825 --> 02:11:10.377
MATT: All right. What's the DC on that?

02:11:10.377 --> 02:11:17.231
MARISHA: Mine, I'm assuming, which is 14. Hang on.
Features and traits.

02:11:17.231 --> 02:11:19.764
MATT: Yeah, whatever your DC is for all of your
monk stuff.

02:11:19.764 --> 02:11:22.581
LIAM, SAM, and TRAVIS: (whispering) Monk stuff!

02:11:22.581 --> 02:11:23.948
MARISHA: Yeah, 14.

02:11:23.948 --> 02:11:38.865
MATT: Okay. It's a wisdom save. No. That's a
natural eight plus four. 12. So all these

02:11:38.865 --> 02:11:43.466
different hits and pressure points are hit, like
under the chin, that area. Another to the sternum

02:11:43.466 --> 02:11:48.928
and another that clocks the temple. And Avantika
just, "Ugh!" (heavy breathing)

02:11:48.928 --> 02:11:55.615
MARISHA: They are unable to speak a deliberate lie
for one minute and all charisma checks have advantage.

02:11:55.615 --> 02:11:59.144
MATT: Intimidation checks? Oh, charisma checks!
Yeah, persuasion, everything else. That's right, yeah.

02:11:59.144 --> 02:12:02.062
LIAM: Mein Gott.

02:12:02.062 --> 02:12:06.291
TRAVIS: Make sure you tell the Plank King it's a
limited time engagement.

02:12:06.291 --> 02:12:07.673
MATT: She's like: "Ugh!"

02:12:07.673 --> 02:12:12.486
MARISHA: You have 60 seconds, but I have more
knuckles.

02:12:12.486 --> 02:12:22.406
MATT: The Plank King steps forward. "Avantika, is
what they're saying true?" She goes, (frustrated

02:12:22.406 --> 02:12:34.797
grunt) Glances aside. Doesn't respond. He leans
forward closer. "Tell me."

02:12:34.797 --> 02:12:37.980
LIAM: (whispering) Silence speaks volumes,
though.

02:12:37.980 --> 02:12:44.584
MATT: "Is what they're saying true? Is that book
containing passages where you're looking to take

02:12:44.584 --> 02:12:55.499
"this island for yourself?" Her eyes look away. She
just looks down at the rest of the dock. He leans

02:12:55.499 --> 02:13:01.364
in real close, pushing his forehead almost to
hers. "Look me in the eye, woman."

02:13:01.364 --> 02:13:04.499
MARISHA: Oh my god!

02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:28.528
MATT: She just doesn't meet his gaze. "Hmm. By the
power of The Revelry that surrounds me, let this

02:13:28.528 --> 02:13:40.694
"be a lesson to those who would work against the
words we swore to each other on this land. May

02:13:40.694 --> 02:13:49.940
"your memory be besmirched for the few days it's
recalled." He reaches forward and grabs Avantika

02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:54.108
by the throat and lifts her up and she's fighting
against it. He lifts her and looks at her. "I hope

02:13:54.108 --> 02:14:01.027
"your sea god, whatever it is, is very merciful on
the other side." (cracking) He breaks her neck

02:14:01.027 --> 02:14:10.676
with one hand. Her body goes limp in his grasp and
he throws it to the docks. "Don't worry about the

02:14:10.676 --> 02:14:20.020
"cipher." Solon goes, "It's actually quite
interesting. I'd like to continue." "Fine."

02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:23.226
LIAM: I worked through the night on that. It's
very interesting.

02:14:23.226 --> 02:14:27.632
MATT: "And it's really well done! I'm honestly
very taken aback by it. Your penmanship is quite

02:14:27.632 --> 02:14:28.711
"good as well."

02:14:28.711 --> 02:14:29.355
LIAM: Breakfast.

02:14:29.355 --> 02:14:32.139
SAM: I have a sample of her penmanship here if you
want to see some more of it.

02:14:32.139 --> 02:14:38.956
MATT: "Oh, certainly!" He goes and starts taking
it. At this point, the Plank King goes, "Take her

02:14:38.956 --> 02:14:51.672
"up top. She'll be the next on the pike. As for the
rest of you, you've pulled out a conspiracy, I'll

02:14:51.672 --> 02:14:58.158
"give you that. You've also snuck your way into The
Revelry under false pretenses. You've broken our

02:14:58.158 --> 02:15:10.823
"laws within but a day of being presented with
them, in multiple ways. That's a serious offense.

02:15:10.823 --> 02:15:27.805
"So hear my judgment upon these folk. You are
hereby banished from Darktow. Take the remnants of

02:15:27.805 --> 02:15:35.811
"the Squalleater as your own. Take whatever--" He
looks over towards the rest of the crew you hired,

02:15:35.811 --> 02:15:37.875
who are like (panicked panting).

02:15:37.875 --> 02:15:40.040
TRAVIS: (laughter) Those poor fuckers!

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:45.884
MATT: They have had a terrible few weeks here!
Except for Orly, who's sitting there, smoking a

02:15:45.884 --> 02:15:49.966
pipe, and his one eye goes.

02:15:49.966 --> 02:15:51.323
TRAVIS: Stone-cold killer.

02:15:51.323 --> 02:15:53.283
LIAM: He is so stoned.

02:15:53.283 --> 02:16:03.060
MATT: "Take the ship you've thereby damaged. Limp
your way beyond the reefs. We're going to burn the

02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:10.705
"colors of that ship. Should you ever return to the
outskirts of the Dragshallow, we won't hesitate

02:16:10.705 --> 02:16:15.031
"but sink you to the depths below."

02:16:15.031 --> 02:16:19.694
TRAVIS: That is beyond a generous sentence.

02:16:19.694 --> 02:16:26.941
MATT: "Unshackle them. This stands immediately. I
hope you have enough supplies in that boat to last

02:16:26.941 --> 02:16:28.824
"you the rest of the journey."

02:16:28.824 --> 02:16:30.300
SAM: (whispering) I don't think that we do.

02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:31.829
TALIESIN: We'll be fine.

02:16:31.829 --> 02:16:35.685
TRAVIS: We'll make do. We will leave with great
haste.

02:16:35.685 --> 02:16:43.527
MATT: "Good. Tell the Archives that the Plank King
sends his regards."

02:16:43.527 --> 02:16:47.500
MARISHA: Will do, good sir.

02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:49.715
MATT: "Now fucking go!"

02:16:49.715 --> 02:16:53.507
LAURA: Before everybody gets on the boat, can I
run over to the docks because I'm not shackled,

02:16:53.507 --> 02:16:57.963
and I try to find the jewels that I dumped off the
docks.

02:16:57.963 --> 02:16:59.966
MATT: Okay. You have to dive into the water to do
so.

02:16:59.966 --> 02:17:01.160
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:06.946
MATT: So, you jump into the water. Make an
investigation-- No, this'll be a perception check

02:17:06.946 --> 02:17:09.172
with disa-fucking-vantage.

02:17:09.172 --> 02:17:11.051
SAM: Disa-fucking-vantage!

02:17:11.051 --> 02:17:11.763
MATT: Yeah.

02:17:11.763 --> 02:17:13.591
LAURA: Ooh! (laughter)

02:17:13.591 --> 02:17:16.039
TALIESIN: Wow, fuck you!

02:17:16.039 --> 02:17:18.032
LAURA: Two ones!

02:17:18.032 --> 02:17:21.762
LIAM: You counterbalanced the rest of this game!

02:17:21.762 --> 02:17:25.054
TALIESIN: Fucking belly flop into the water!

02:17:25.054 --> 02:17:26.648
TRAVIS: Sin eater!

02:17:26.648 --> 02:17:29.596
SAM: Two ones in a roll.

02:17:29.596 --> 02:17:33.017
LIAM: Has that happened since the walk of shame?

02:17:33.017 --> 02:17:34.303
LAURA: No.

02:17:34.303 --> 02:17:37.678
LIAM: Two years ago.

02:17:37.678 --> 02:17:45.850
MATT: You spend the next five or so minutes
scrounging through silt and muck and barnacles and

02:17:45.850 --> 02:17:53.065
gathered bits of kelp and various other underwater
plant life that has rooted itself among the rocks

02:17:53.065 --> 02:17:58.961
here. You've scraped your fingers, they're
bleeding from digging through. You find a cluster

02:17:58.961 --> 02:18:03.977
of these gems that you dropped and you climb up
out of the freezing water and find one of the

02:18:03.977 --> 02:18:09.020
nearby ladders and come up. Looking at your
quarry, it is a bunch of rocks.

02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:12.523
TALIESIN: Come on, Jester, let's--

02:18:12.523 --> 02:18:14.566
MATT: Oh you don't see Jester. You just see an old
prospector come up.

02:18:14.566 --> 02:18:15.351
TALIESIN: That's right.

02:18:15.351 --> 02:18:17.114
TRAVIS: You're a prospector!

02:18:17.114 --> 02:18:21.652
LAURA: These are beautiful rocks. Beautiful.

02:18:21.652 --> 02:18:26.014
MATT: You guys are ushered to the Squalleater.
Your crew is ushered to the Squalleater.

02:18:26.014 --> 02:18:28.686
SAM: Oh! The Mist is gone? The Mistake?

02:18:28.686 --> 02:18:32.537
MATT: The Mistake is still in repairs and at this
point has been left behind.

02:18:32.537 --> 02:18:35.296
LIAM: Ja, we will take the bigger boat!

02:18:35.296 --> 02:18:40.180
TRAVIS: Avantika's crew are still manacled up?

02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:46.940
MATT: The remained of them, yes. Bouldergut is
heavily manacled and is currently guarded by seven

02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:48.160
different guards.

02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:49.306
MARISHA: Should we try to take them?

02:18:49.306 --> 02:18:51.482
TRAVIS: No. Maybe one or two of them. Ipess?

02:18:51.482 --> 02:18:53.361
LAURA: What? They're going to hate us.

02:18:53.361 --> 02:18:54.306
LIAM: No.

02:18:54.306 --> 02:18:56.342
TRAVIS: What? We've got to have somebody to kill
while we're at sea.

02:18:56.342 --> 02:18:57.246
LIAM: No.

02:18:57.246 --> 02:18:58.275
SAM: Yeah, we have our crew.

02:18:58.275 --> 02:18:59.834
LIAM: We have our crew. We do not need them.

02:18:59.834 --> 02:19:01.672
TALIESIN: Yeah, we've got a way.

02:19:01.672 --> 02:19:03.508
MARISHA: Yeah, we know how to sail now.

02:19:03.508 --> 02:19:05.618
TRAVIS: Better. Yeah, and they do.

02:19:05.618 --> 02:19:14.939
MATT: All right. As you guys get on the ship with
your crew, the ship is damaged, the sails are

02:19:14.939 --> 02:19:20.852
damaged, one of the masts is damaged. It's going
to need some repairs for it to be fully

02:19:20.852 --> 02:19:23.324
functional. But you have to leave now.

02:19:23.324 --> 02:19:25.421
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.

02:19:25.421 --> 02:19:32.797
MATT: You take your positions at the ship, pull up
the anchor, and make your way limping through the

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:40.423
channel of Dragshallow Reef, back out towards the
Swavain Islands, the Lucidian Ocean. As you slowly

02:19:40.423 --> 02:19:45.290
make your way with what little bit of wind you can
pick up to bring you out there-- some of the sails

02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:52.689
are still working, so you're not fully damaged,
but you're not optimal. There are a series of

02:19:52.689 --> 02:20:03.395
these-- what are referred to as the War Posts that
are the clusters of driftwood and these towers

02:20:03.395 --> 02:20:07.031
that are set up along the reef and on top of the
various reefs that are shallow or breach the

02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:15.149
actual surface that have cannons attached, that
have flares set up and beacons that can be lit to

02:20:15.149 --> 02:20:20.588
alert Darktow. You get a better look this time of
the system they have to defend this island from

02:20:20.588 --> 02:20:29.019
the Clovis Concord and anybody else that would
look to make their way via ship to this island.

02:20:29.019 --> 02:20:34.857
You can see them at the ready, keeping a very
close eye on your exit as you slowly walk of shame

02:20:34.857 --> 02:20:43.929
yourselves out of the purview of the Plank King
and to a very carefully earned freedom.

02:20:43.929 --> 02:20:49.422
TRAVIS: If I may, who is really good at finding
shit? You two, and anyone--

02:20:49.422 --> 02:20:50.544
MARISHA: Like investigation style?

02:20:50.544 --> 02:20:55.633
TRAVIS: Yeah. How about you three, into Avantika's
quarters and turn it upside down.

02:20:55.633 --> 02:20:59.429
MARISHA: Ooh, you are turning me on right now.

02:20:59.429 --> 02:21:00.685
TRAVIS: Not my intention, but go ahead.

02:21:00.685 --> 02:21:01.306
MARISHA: Yes!

02:21:01.306 --> 02:21:01.981
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:21:01.981 --> 02:21:08.330
TRAVIS: Just in case she booby trapped this ship,
search the hull, search her quarters, search everything.

02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:10.595
MARISHA: Yeah, check for traps first, okay?

02:21:10.595 --> 02:21:12.193
LIAM: I'll be doing that at disadvantage.

02:21:12.193 --> 02:21:13.468
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and calm the crew a
little bit.

02:21:13.468 --> 02:21:14.108
MATT: Okay.

02:21:14.108 --> 02:21:20.588
TALIESIN: I'll point out that we're-- this is all
good. We got away from the pirates, everything's all right.

02:21:20.588 --> 02:21:26.377
MATT: Make a general persuasion check for me. Just
a persuasion check.

02:21:27.876 --> 02:21:29.172
TALIESIN: That's 15.

02:21:29.172 --> 02:21:35.625
MATT: Okay, you do. A number of the crew that you
hired, some of them look like they're a little

02:21:35.649 --> 02:21:41.435
scarred from the experience, but you managed to
calm them down. They seem very thankful that

02:21:41.595 --> 02:21:45.224
you've pulled them-- you brought them into this
mess, but you pulled them out of it and there's

02:21:45.224 --> 02:21:52.846
something to that. Some of them begin to get back
to work, begin to repair some of the aspects of

02:21:52.846 --> 02:21:58.388
the ship. Man.

02:21:58.388 --> 02:22:01.274
TRAVIS: Is Jester able to mend some of those
damaged--?

02:22:01.274 --> 02:22:05.403
LAURA: That's what I was going to try to do, yeah.
Anything that's small enough, I'm going to try to

02:22:05.403 --> 02:22:07.068
mend. Small holes.

02:22:07.068 --> 02:22:08.080
LIAM: 20 percent of the damage?

02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:08.916
LAURA: Yeah.

02:22:08.916 --> 02:22:13.646
MATT: There are a few places, but for the most
part-- and it's only the one mast. You still have

02:22:13.646 --> 02:22:18.645
enough sails because it's a three-mast ship. You
can still coast the winds, but it's not going to

02:22:18.645 --> 02:22:24.022
be optimal speed. You'll have to get back to some
sort of a port to get the rest of the sails

02:22:24.022 --> 02:22:30.080
repaired because you don't have replacement sails.
The downside of the Fireball. The Fireball and

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:34.495
the-- actually. It was a 20-foot tall Wall of
Fire.

02:22:34.495 --> 02:22:36.411
LIAM: Yes, but the upside was so--

02:22:36.411 --> 02:22:37.652
MATT: It was.

02:22:37.652 --> 02:22:39.809
SAM: Then you singed the other sails, too.

02:22:39.809 --> 02:22:41.328
MATT: Yeah, there's a lot of sail-- you have--

02:22:41.328 --> 02:22:46.110
LIAM: Yeah, 20 feet tall. For six to 12 seconds.
That didn't last more than two rounds.

02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:47.988
MATT: I know, but that's a very intense--

02:22:47.988 --> 02:22:49.060
LIAM: Absolutely.

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:55.753
MATT: I would say comparatively, you're limping on
one full mast of functionality, and the rest of

02:22:55.753 --> 02:22:57.488
the sails are partially damaged.

02:22:57.488 --> 02:22:59.703
LIAM: (gasps) (pigeon coos) Paint on the mast.

02:22:59.703 --> 02:23:04.347
LAURA: (pigeon coo) I was thinking about it, but
it's a lot of the use of the paint because--

02:23:04.347 --> 02:23:06.653
SAM: (pigeon coo) How about a few sails?

02:23:06.653 --> 02:23:13.818
TALIESIN: We don't have to pigeon this. I mean, we
know what you can do, so maybe paint the fix for it.

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:15.283
MATT: Just so you know--

02:23:15.283 --> 02:23:17.598
LAURA: That's what I want. I don't want to paint
the whole thing.

02:23:17.598 --> 02:23:24.337
MATT: Just so you know, this ship travels on an
average pace of around 48 miles a day. Right now

02:23:24.337 --> 02:23:28.961
with the damage the sails have sustained, you're
close to 20. You're less than half speed on the

02:23:28.961 --> 02:23:36.495
ship with the damage it's sustained at the sails.
It's going to take you a while to get anywhere.

02:23:36.495 --> 02:23:37.988
But you have it.

02:23:37.988 --> 02:23:40.906
LAURA: How big are the holes? Are they giant?

02:23:40.906 --> 02:23:42.005
MATT: They're beyond Mending.

02:23:42.005 --> 02:23:42.698
LAURA: Okay.

02:23:42.698 --> 02:23:44.467
MATT: Mending can do little tears and things.

02:23:44.467 --> 02:23:47.668
LAURA: No, I'm not talking Mending, I'm talking
how big are the holes?

02:23:47.668 --> 02:23:53.038
MATT: For the ones that are damaged, the sails are
mostly destroyed. They caught fire and burned.

02:23:53.038 --> 02:24:01.535
LIAM: I have a question. If I finally go to bed
for like 14 hours-- Minor Alchemy for a

02:24:01.535 --> 02:24:07.382
transmutation wizard. I am able to perform an
alchemical procedure on one object composed

02:24:07.382 --> 02:24:13.672
entirely of wood, stone, iron, copper, silver, and
transform it into another material. If there was

02:24:13.672 --> 02:24:18.658
damage to the mast, would I be able to shove other
things in there and turn it to wood? That seems

02:24:18.658 --> 02:24:21.161
like too much.

02:24:21.161 --> 02:24:23.245
MATT: Doesn't quite work that way, and it's
temporary. It's more--

02:24:23.245 --> 02:24:27.139
LIAM: It's a spell that I could've done, but I
didn't take that spell. I chose Counterspell.

02:24:27.139 --> 02:24:30.464
MATT: To be fair, I think that worked in your
favor. If tonight has proved anything, if the end

02:24:30.464 --> 02:24:33.606
of the last campaign has proved anything,
Counterspell's always a good choice.

02:24:33.606 --> 02:24:37.025
TALIESIN: We're going to spend a day moving
slowly, but I think we're going to slowly figure

02:24:37.025 --> 02:24:43.242
out how, between all of us, we can repair this,
and I'm sure we can figure out where to get some cloth.

02:24:43.242 --> 02:24:45.794
MARISHA: This just turned into a resource
management game.

02:24:45.794 --> 02:24:47.279
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a lot different kind of
game.

02:24:47.279 --> 02:24:52.525
MATT: You guys have now pushed into the rest of
the seafaring mist. It takes you a while to move

02:24:52.525 --> 02:24:56.595
beyond the Dragshallow Reef, the better part of
the day before you escape the channel at the pace

02:24:56.595 --> 02:25:02.684
you're moving. The clouds are pretty heavy now.
The open sky that you enjoyed on your way to

02:25:02.684 --> 02:25:09.401
Darktow has now become-- not a storm front by any
means, but definitely cloudier skies. As you're

02:25:09.401 --> 02:25:16.943
heading outside, you can see Yasha smelling the
air and be like, "This might be getting close to

02:25:16.943 --> 02:25:19.629
"storm weather."

02:25:19.629 --> 02:25:20.982
TRAVIS: Is that a good thing?

02:25:20.982 --> 02:25:22.311
MATT: She smiles.

02:25:22.311 --> 02:25:25.457
TRAVIS: It's a good thing.

02:25:25.457 --> 02:25:30.546
MATT: Continuing past into that space, repairs are
being done best you can, with the ship still

02:25:30.546 --> 02:25:35.076
limping along. You make your way out of the
Dragshallow Reef, out into open waters, and the

02:25:35.076 --> 02:25:36.746
ocean is yours.

02:25:36.746 --> 02:25:38.448
TRAVIS: Can I find Orly?

02:25:38.448 --> 02:25:39.162
MATT: Yeah.

02:25:39.162 --> 02:25:41.720
TRAVIS: I'll bring out the map.

02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:44.400
MATT: Bring out the map.

02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:45.864
TRAVIS: I don't have it near me.

02:25:45.864 --> 02:25:47.095
LAURA: Should we get close to a port or
something?

02:25:47.095 --> 02:25:48.168
TALIESIN: Or an island where we--

02:25:48.168 --> 02:25:50.242
TRAVIS: Do we know where the map is, please?

02:25:50.242 --> 02:25:51.964
SAM: (singing) Bring out the map!

02:25:51.964 --> 02:25:57.304
MATT: It's usually right there. It got moved for
Honey Heist, that's why. Oh, is it down there? Oh,

02:25:57.304 --> 02:25:59.912
there it is! It got hidden! It got moved from me!

02:25:59.912 --> 02:26:00.599
TRAVIS: Damn it, Bobby!

02:26:00.599 --> 02:26:02.624
MATT: Damn it, Bobby. There you go.

02:26:02.624 --> 02:26:05.421
LIAM: I sell falchions and--

02:26:05.421 --> 02:26:09.953
MARISHA: I'm having an adrenaline crash now.

02:26:09.953 --> 02:26:11.817
LIAM: Yeah, we survived and--

02:26:11.817 --> 02:26:14.830
MARISHA: Are those little zoomy magnifying
glasses?

02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:17.130
LIAM: They're magnifying, Matt? Where'd you get
those?

02:26:17.130 --> 02:26:21.687
MARISHA: The crew got them. That was Max. Thanks,
producer Max!

02:26:21.687 --> 02:26:25.359
TRAVIS: Do we know if we are making our way--?

02:26:25.359 --> 02:26:29.125
MATT: You guys have just managed to make your way
out of here.

02:26:29.125 --> 02:26:31.188
SAM: Oh, going the wrong way.

02:26:31.188 --> 02:26:34.698
LIAM: So we're going right into her vagina.

02:26:34.698 --> 02:26:38.232
MATT: Well, that is the Wildmother. She is nature,
I guess.

02:26:38.232 --> 02:26:44.852
TRAVIS: I'll tell Orly: Orly, if you could help us
plot a course, as damaged as we are, heading north

02:26:44.852 --> 02:26:47.403
to this point.

02:26:47.403 --> 02:26:50.082
LAURA: Shouldn't we get to a port or something
before we--?

02:26:50.082 --> 02:26:51.181
SAM: Yeah, we need to repair first.

02:26:51.181 --> 02:26:52.205
LIAM: There ain't no fucking port around here,
motherfucker.

02:26:52.205 --> 02:26:58.225
SAM: Well, maybe there's something over here! He
knows about something. Let's ask! Orly? M-m-maybe?

02:26:58.225 --> 02:27:00.258
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:27:00.258 --> 02:27:08.191
LIAM: Max Headroom, coming at you from the
mid-80s! W-w-what?

02:27:08.191 --> 02:27:11.175
MATT: It's a good thing I grew up a stutterer.

02:27:11.175 --> 02:27:16.861
LIAM: Yeah. Matt is just barely old enough to know
what that is.

02:27:16.861 --> 02:27:18.392
MATT: Oh, I know Max Headroom.

02:27:18.392 --> 02:27:21.596
LIAM: I said you know what it is! Just barely.

02:27:21.596 --> 02:27:25.560
MATT: It's funny, I didn't realize who played him
until years later and I was like, really, him?

02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:27.019
TRAVIS: Wait, who played him?

02:27:27.019 --> 02:27:28.623
MATT: Oh, what's the actor?

02:27:28.623 --> 02:27:32.493
LIAM: He was in The Stand as the Trashcan Man.

02:27:32.493 --> 02:27:38.622
MATT: He was, and he played the part of Jobe in
Lawnmower Man 2. Anyway!

02:27:38.622 --> 02:27:48.482
TRAVIS: Because this is on a trade run, and this
whole isle is part of that, could we make port for

02:27:48.482 --> 02:27:50.884
more extensive repairs there?

02:27:50.884 --> 02:27:55.146
MATT: It's a resource stop. It might have some
repairs, in your experience. It's not a major port

02:27:55.146 --> 02:27:58.852
by any means, it's more of a small--

02:27:58.852 --> 02:27:59.826
TRAVIS: Resupply?

02:27:59.826 --> 02:28:00.663
MATT: Yeah, it's a resupply.

02:28:00.663 --> 02:28:02.083
LAURA: Might have canvas, at least.

02:28:02.083 --> 02:28:03.657
TALIESIN: We can use Divination.

02:28:03.657 --> 02:28:04.763
TRAVIS: That's the closest thing.

02:28:04.763 --> 02:28:06.102
MATT: From your experience--

02:28:06.102 --> 02:28:08.706
TRAVIS: Divination? What do you mean?

02:28:08.706 --> 02:28:14.429
TALIESIN: If it's been 24 hours-- once I have a
long rest, I can take my morning meditation and

02:28:14.429 --> 02:28:20.291
ask the Wildmother if there's a place of calm for
our boat.

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:21.752
LAURA: You can do that?

02:28:21.752 --> 02:28:22.714
TALIESIN: I can do a lot of stuff, man.

02:28:22.714 --> 02:28:24.932
TRAVIS: I would love to have you do that.

02:28:24.932 --> 02:28:26.638
LIAM: Are you doing that?

02:28:26.638 --> 02:28:30.033
TALIESIN: I was going to do that. Yeah.

02:28:30.033 --> 02:28:38.416
MATT: To answer your question, Orly goes, "Yeah.
There's a way to get that working for you. We'll

02:28:38.416 --> 02:28:51.646
"all take course and head for that m-m-mighty
dangerous part of the sea." He marks it and they

02:28:51.646 --> 02:28:55.574
set it. You guys have been making your way around
the Dragshallow northward towards that area.

02:28:55.574 --> 02:28:57.708
SAM: Is that past where we're going?

02:28:57.859 --> 02:28:59.861
TRAVIS: It is, but we don't have any other--

02:28:59.861 --> 02:29:03.337
TALIESIN: Yeah, in the early morning I'm going to
go to the crow's nest and have a ten-minute

02:29:03.337 --> 02:29:10.392
meditation and ask the Wildmother which direction
we should be heading to find some safe harbor to

02:29:10.392 --> 02:29:13.632
heal ourselves and heal our boat.

02:29:13.632 --> 02:29:15.810
MATT: Okay. Is this an ability, or--

02:29:15.810 --> 02:29:18.850
TALIESIN: Yes, it is a 4th-level spell, it's
Divination.

02:29:18.850 --> 02:29:20.433
MATT: Oh, there we go.

02:29:20.433 --> 02:29:27.981
TALIESIN: I'm using it. It takes ten minutes, and
you can be as obtuse as you like. You can be a

02:29:27.981 --> 02:29:30.984
bird that flies in a direction, an insect, or
whatever.

02:29:30.984 --> 02:29:34.014
TRAVIS: Thank you for the Shawshank obtuse
reference.

02:29:34.014 --> 02:29:44.249
MATT: Okay, yeah. The Wildmother responds--
Actually, let me see what will be the best answer

02:29:44.249 --> 02:29:54.998
to this one, give me just a second. (stage
whisper) Talk amongst yourselves.

02:29:54.998 --> 02:30:01.570
TALIESIN: I was seeing if there was anything else
I can do-- I'm setting day two spells so we'll

02:30:01.570 --> 02:30:02.938
have food and water.

02:30:02.938 --> 02:30:09.108
LIAM: If we're talking about, like business shit,
Caleb is going to Beau and saying: I'm sorry, I

02:30:09.108 --> 02:30:14.850
know that this has been less than ten days, but I
need my cat, so I am taking my owl, I apologize.

02:30:14.850 --> 02:30:28.709
On a side note, so impressed. I walk off with my
little tiny one-ounce owl.

02:30:28.709 --> 02:30:29.755
MARISHA: Bye, Frumpkin.

02:30:29.755 --> 02:30:35.173
LIAM: I will take the time to turn Frumpkin- I
have two uses left with incense- back into a

02:30:35.173 --> 02:30:42.847
Bengal cat. So he can live his best life as a
Bengal cat.

02:30:42.847 --> 02:30:45.417
SAM: (imitating Liam's accent) Bengal cat.

02:30:45.417 --> 02:30:48.055
LIAM: Diplomatic cat-munity.

02:30:58.592 --> 02:31:04.544
MATT: You get that situated. Anybody else doing
anything?

02:31:04.544 --> 02:31:06.389
LAURA: I'm going to--

02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:16.232
MATT: Your answer, by the way, is: "Bisaft Isle
brings you safest harbor in what you seek."

02:31:16.232 --> 02:31:19.962
TALIESIN and SAM: Bisaft.

02:31:19.962 --> 02:31:28.614
MATT: There's a warm, gentle embrace that comes
with the words, an understanding, and a familiar

02:31:28.614 --> 02:31:37.927
matronly guidance that brings you calm on the
ocean seas that have long brought you anxiety. For

02:31:37.927 --> 02:31:41.823
the first time in probably a good number of weeks,
you get to walk out on that deck, take a deep

02:31:41.823 --> 02:31:46.598
breath of ocean air, and feel really confident.

02:31:46.598 --> 02:31:56.709
TALIESIN: Sea smells different today. Might just
be the charred boat and-- Oh, no. Bisaft.

02:31:56.709 --> 02:31:58.876
TRAVIS: You look rejuvenated. Did you say Bisaft?

02:31:58.876 --> 02:32:04.122
TALIESIN: Bisaft. We're to head towards Bisaft.

02:32:04.122 --> 02:32:05.983
TRAVIS: You're sure?

02:32:05.983 --> 02:32:08.426
TALIESIN: Sure as anything.

02:32:08.426 --> 02:32:10.969
TRAVIS: All right then. You can let Orly know.

02:32:10.969 --> 02:32:12.960
TALIESIN: Orly!

02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:15.819
MATT: "Mm-hmm?"

02:32:15.819 --> 02:32:17.439
TALIESIN: Know the Isle of Bisaft?

02:32:17.439 --> 02:32:20.182
MATT: "Oh, I'm quite familiar."

02:32:20.182 --> 02:32:24.217
TALIESIN: That seem to be the direction we're
heading right now?

02:32:24.217 --> 02:32:31.225
MATT: "About as close as any direction gets,
really." Other eye, even.

02:32:31.225 --> 02:32:35.276
TALIESIN: I think that might be the place we ought
to go.

02:32:35.776 --> 02:32:46.988
MATT: Making it jump around a bit, guys. "Mm. Very
well. M-m-make sure to point this ship in that direction."

02:32:46.988 --> 02:32:48.124
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:32:48.124 --> 02:32:50.214
MATT: "And you."

02:32:51.091 --> 02:32:56.800
SAM: On the first day we were on this boat, me and
Beau and others were going to go into Avantika's

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.562
cabin and snoop around.

02:32:58.562 --> 02:33:04.823
LIAM: Oh right. I rolled an 18 and a 19 ten
minutes ago.

02:33:04.823 --> 02:33:08.460
MARISHA: I don't know if I rolled. I don't think I
did.

02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:12.824
SAM: I didn't roll yet either, but I was going to
crawl in through the hole in her floor if it's

02:33:12.824 --> 02:33:14.024
still there.

02:33:14.024 --> 02:33:15.056
MATT: Oh, it's still there.

02:33:15.056 --> 02:33:21.052
SAM: To avoid any traps, and then look around the
door from the inside to see if she had trapped it

02:33:21.052 --> 02:33:22.555
or anything.

02:33:22.555 --> 02:33:25.367
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check on that.

02:33:26.528 --> 02:33:28.761
SAM: 20. 19.

02:33:28.761 --> 02:33:29.968
MATT: No, it is not trapped.

02:33:29.968 --> 02:33:31.901
SAM: I'll open it and let you guys in.

02:33:31.901 --> 02:33:41.579
LIAM: I rolled an investigation check ten minutes
ago at disadvantage and the lower is a 27. My

02:33:41.579 --> 02:33:44.185
investigation is plus eight. I'm smart--

02:33:44.185 --> 02:33:45.330
MATT: The lower was 19?

02:33:45.330 --> 02:33:47.858
LIAM: Yes. I rolled an 18 and a 19.

02:33:47.858 --> 02:33:51.544
SAM: Well, I'll show Caleb around the room that
I've already been in to see if he can find

02:33:51.544 --> 02:33:53.230
anything else.

02:33:53.230 --> 02:33:56.556
MARISHA: I'm in there too.

02:33:56.556 --> 02:34:05.630
MATT: Glancing around, you find-- There's her
dresser with a number of outfits, coats, shirts,

02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:12.481
things that belong to the captain that you guys
get to distribute as you see fit.

02:34:12.481 --> 02:34:14.717
LAURA: (cartoon voice) Hey, look at me! I'm
Avantika!

02:34:14.717 --> 02:34:16.762
LIAM: Are there any more gigantic hats?

02:34:16.762 --> 02:34:18.779
MARISHA: I was going to say teddies, but...

02:34:18.779 --> 02:34:20.089
MATT: There's a few hats, yeah.

02:34:20.089 --> 02:34:21.465
LIAM: Gigantic hats.

02:34:21.465 --> 02:34:22.576
MATT: Avantika-sized hats.

02:34:22.576 --> 02:34:26.842
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (singing) Hats and teddies.
Hats, hats, and teddies.

02:34:26.842 --> 02:34:33.290
(laughter)

02:34:33.290 --> 02:34:38.488
SAM: Does she have a fragrance or anything? Like a
perfume?

02:34:38.488 --> 02:34:40.446
MARISHA: Chanel No. 5.

02:34:40.446 --> 02:34:45.641
MATT: I will say you do find some scented oils,
but that's the extent.

02:34:45.641 --> 02:34:46.717
SAM: I'll take those.

02:34:46.717 --> 02:34:48.502
MATT: She's not a perfume keeper.

02:34:48.502 --> 02:34:50.741
TALIESIN: How about that statue above the door?

02:34:50.741 --> 02:34:53.073
LAURA: Yeah, her little altar.

02:34:53.073 --> 02:34:56.111
MATT: The altar is still there, the altar to
Uk'otoa.

02:34:56.111 --> 02:35:01.180
MARISHA: The maps-- the stuff behind her, charting
out where she was going, anything in there?

02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:11.211
MATT: Yeah. You find a few other maps and things
that refer to a-- You see it breaking down the

02:35:11.211 --> 02:35:15.413
different trade routes, and you see other paths
breaking out; those that try and avoid the trade

02:35:15.413 --> 02:35:19.340
routes to avoid the pirates. Those different paths
they might take at different times of the year to

02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:23.855
try and head off people that are trying to avoid
the waters that they're looking in. You find maps

02:35:23.855 --> 02:35:31.789
that deal with the path to Urukayxl, and you see
the handwritten map by Jamedi that was the path

02:35:31.789 --> 02:35:38.598
you guys were lead through on Urukayxl to find the
temple. You find another map that has circled

02:35:38.598 --> 02:35:47.116
heavily the archipelago that you've already sussed
out, and you find recent notes on that same map

02:35:47.116 --> 02:35:53.528
that refer to the loose area circled where your
ship went down that time ago.

02:35:53.597 --> 02:35:59.444
TRAVIS: Will we pass over that area as we're
heading towards Bisaft?

02:35:59.444 --> 02:36:06.873
MATT: Well, you'll get near that area. If you want
to head that way, you can let Orly know to--

02:36:06.873 --> 02:36:08.309
MARISHA: It's on the way...

02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:09.762
LIAM: Are you in this room with us too, right
now?

02:36:09.762 --> 02:36:12.432
TRAVIS: No, I'm just asking.

02:36:12.432 --> 02:36:18.514
MATT: You find a lot of those materials. You get
the sense that, aside from the maps, most of the

02:36:18.514 --> 02:36:21.217
information that she had, she kept in that book.

02:36:21.217 --> 02:36:28.981
MARISHA: Any supplies list? Any inventory: canvas
on board, things to make supplies?

02:36:28.981 --> 02:36:31.676
MATT: You find a number of fine cheeses,
actually.

02:36:31.676 --> 02:36:35.903
MARISHA: Chocolate dipped strawberries,
champ-pag-nay.

02:36:35.903 --> 02:36:40.756
MATT: Not quite. All the good food was kept for
the captain and some of it's turning a little, but

02:36:40.756 --> 02:36:51.134
it's cheese. Some better treats and some sugared
candies that were kept specifically, like a

02:36:51.134 --> 02:36:54.058
private stash for the captain, you manage to
find.

02:36:54.058 --> 02:36:59.605
SAM: While we're down there, looking around, I'm
going to say: So, you know, it's just the three of

02:36:59.605 --> 02:37:01.414
us down here.

02:37:01.414 --> 02:37:03.178
LIAM: Yeah. I'm sitting on the bed right now.

02:37:03.178 --> 02:37:06.034
SAM: We have some secrets between us already.

02:37:06.034 --> 02:37:09.443
MARISHA: Yeah, it's been a while since just the
three of us have been in a room together.

02:37:09.443 --> 02:37:17.960
LIAM: Wait a second, look at me. I'm sitting on
the bed. I am the servant of a demigod. This is

02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:20.537
going to be very hard for Fjord.

02:37:20.537 --> 02:37:22.258
SAM: Yes, well...

02:37:22.258 --> 02:37:25.010
MARISHA: What? You're jumping around so much.

02:37:25.010 --> 02:37:30.644
LIAM: We can get back to what you're talking
about, but think about it for a moment; it's just

02:37:30.644 --> 02:37:39.254
the three of us, right? We have our heads in the
same game. We are the three assholes in this

02:37:39.254 --> 02:37:40.820
group, yeah?

02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:45.158
SAM: I'm asshole adjacent.

02:37:45.158 --> 02:37:47.040
MARISHA: She's quite pleasant, actually.

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:48.314
LIAM: That is correct.

02:37:48.314 --> 02:37:51.071
MARISHA: She might be better than both of us
combined.

02:37:51.071 --> 02:37:57.830
LIAM: I'm joking because this has been such a hard
day, but Fjord is going to find this very difficult.

02:37:57.830 --> 02:38:00.680
SAM: We're going to protect him, like we always
do.

02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:05.807
MARISHA: Which part difficult? Losing his fuck
buddy? It's not that difficult.

02:38:05.807 --> 02:38:14.044
LIAM: That is minimalizing what he is dealing with
right now. He is trying to find a father, he has

02:38:14.044 --> 02:38:20.192
compromised himself with this woman for us, for
himself, for all of our safety. It is going to be

02:38:20.192 --> 02:38:21.470
difficult for him.

02:38:21.470 --> 02:38:28.369
MARISHA: Of course it's minimalizing, have you met
me? Everything I do is minimalizing.

02:38:28.369 --> 02:38:31.282
LIAM: You have your pluses and your minuses.

02:38:31.282 --> 02:38:41.591
SAM: Speaking of your pluses: the Expositors?
You're special forces, did I hear that correctly?

02:38:41.591 --> 02:38:43.582
Is that what you are called?

02:38:43.582 --> 02:38:44.493
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:38:44.493 --> 02:38:48.125
SAM: Is that true? It seemed pretty true.

02:38:48.125 --> 02:38:50.932
MARISHA: Yeah, what Caleb said.

02:38:50.932 --> 02:38:52.216
LIAM: It's mostly true.

02:38:52.216 --> 02:38:53.917
SAM: What do you mean-- How do you know?

02:38:53.917 --> 02:38:56.769
MARISHA: Yeah, how do you know?

02:38:56.769 --> 02:39:03.694
LIAM: She is too educated. She is too in-the-know
to talk the way she does, to be interested in just

02:39:03.694 --> 02:39:13.132
drinking and chasing our barbarian friend. She is
very educated. I don't know which parts are true.

02:39:13.132 --> 02:39:17.072
SAM: Well, which parts are true?

02:39:17.072 --> 02:39:18.912
MARISHA: You want to take a guess?

02:39:18.912 --> 02:39:26.167
SAM: I think you're a secret agent! I think you're
on a dangerous mission- a life or death mission-

02:39:26.167 --> 02:39:32.389
to find bad guys and take them down! To get the
collar and bring them in to the po-po, or

02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:35.931
something. I don't know how it works! I'm not a
secret agent, you are!

02:39:35.931 --> 02:39:40.444
MARISHA: It's very romanticized, but on that note:
Caleb, do you think you could recreate that cipher

02:39:40.444 --> 02:39:44.463
that you made and have one on hand?

02:39:44.526 --> 02:39:47.002
LIAM: Of course. That is easy.

02:39:47.002 --> 02:39:49.445
MARISHA: I'd like a copy, if you don't mind.

02:39:49.445 --> 02:39:53.161
LIAM: Sure, what are friends for.

02:39:53.161 --> 02:39:55.927
SAM: Do you have a license to kill?

02:39:56.978 --> 02:40:06.781
MARISHA: Got them right here, Nott. Just these--
No, that wasn't working? No? All right. Yeah, it's

02:40:06.781 --> 02:40:12.055
a little true, but not as intense as you think.

02:40:12.055 --> 02:40:14.164
SAM: Are there others like you?

02:40:14.164 --> 02:40:15.986
MARISHA: Monks?

02:40:15.986 --> 02:40:18.100
SAM: No, like--

02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:19.381
MARISHA: Expositors?

02:40:19.381 --> 02:40:20.810
SAM: Yeah, Delta Force.

02:40:20.810 --> 02:40:22.218
MARISHA: Yes.

02:40:22.218 --> 02:40:27.508
SAM: How do you know who's who? Do you have a
sign? Secret handshake?

02:40:28.979 --> 02:40:31.988
MARISHA: Kind of new to it all, to be honest.

02:40:35.010 --> 02:40:37.622
SAM: You guys are really cool.

02:40:37.622 --> 02:40:42.993
LIAM: No. I am looking forward to getting back to
the mainland, and I don't mean the Menagerie

02:40:42.993 --> 02:40:50.759
Coast. Although... We need to get Jester back to
her mother if we can, but I am not looking forward

02:40:50.759 --> 02:40:54.380
to being here anymore. I want to get back to the
Empire.

02:40:54.380 --> 02:41:01.769
MARISHA: Speaking of time that it takes to travel,
are we sure that Avantika was the only one who was

02:41:01.769 --> 02:41:05.987
interested in what Uk'otoa has to offer?

02:41:05.987 --> 02:41:12.779
LIAM: Well, there is still Vandren. I have read
every inch of her notes, I have communicated them to you.

02:41:12.779 --> 02:41:18.646
MARISHA: I guess what I'm saying is, are we still
going to be competing against others once the

02:41:18.646 --> 02:41:22.729
Plank King successfully deciphers that book?

02:41:22.729 --> 02:41:31.804
LIAM: I would imagine the Plank King would not
know what to make of it. It clearly damns her. It

02:41:31.804 --> 02:41:35.851
does not give him enough information-- He wouldn't
know what to do with it.

02:41:35.851 --> 02:41:37.698
MARISHA: It does kind of sound like a wives'
tale.

02:41:37.698 --> 02:41:44.263
LIAM: Yeah, he's not a big thinker. He is
formidable, but not a big thinker. I think we will

02:41:44.263 --> 02:41:47.140
have an easier time getting to this boat.

02:41:47.140 --> 02:41:51.100
MARISHA: Let's go talk about it with the others, I
think.

02:41:51.100 --> 02:41:55.879
SAM: Your secret is safe with me.

02:41:56.647 --> 02:41:59.247
LAURA: Above deck, can I go find Fjord?

02:41:59.247 --> 02:42:00.978
MATT: Yeah.

02:42:00.978 --> 02:42:06.861
LAURA: So... that happened. (giggles)

02:42:06.861 --> 02:42:08.862
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:42:08.862 --> 02:42:12.567
LAURA: How do you feel about it?

02:42:12.567 --> 02:42:15.140
TRAVIS: Relieved.

02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:16.303
LAURA: Yeah?

02:42:16.303 --> 02:42:22.951
TRAVIS: Yeah. I was worried for a moment there. I
knew it was going to come to something like that,

02:42:22.951 --> 02:42:25.709
but Caleb pulling the trigger the way he did
was--

02:42:25.709 --> 02:42:28.542
LAURA: Did he cause that explosion?

02:42:28.542 --> 02:42:30.007
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:42:30.007 --> 02:42:31.512
LAURA: Wow.

02:42:31.512 --> 02:42:32.487
TRAVIS: Right.

02:42:32.487 --> 02:42:34.197
LAURA: He did a lot of damage.

02:42:34.197 --> 02:42:38.469
TRAVIS: He did. He's very strong.

02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:45.492
LAURA: So now we're going to find the place where
your ship wrecked, yeah?

02:42:45.492 --> 02:42:48.468
TRAVIS: I think so, yeah.

02:42:48.468 --> 02:42:52.124
LAURA: You didn't get to ask them about Vandren,
though.

02:42:52.557 --> 02:43:05.409
TRAVIS: No, I didn't. It hurts to see so many
react to a name that only meant so much to me,

02:43:05.409 --> 02:43:12.325
but-- I don't even know if he's alive. We might
find him down there.

02:43:12.611 --> 02:43:21.686
LAURA: Wow. Do you think if we find him, you'll
stop talking like him?

02:43:24.467 --> 02:43:27.413
TRAVIS: We'll see.

02:43:28.908 --> 02:43:32.778
LAURA: You know, I could probably send a message
to the Plank King and ask him about Vandren, if

02:43:32.778 --> 02:43:34.630
you want me to.

02:43:34.923 --> 02:43:36.324
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

02:43:36.324 --> 02:43:41.281
LAURA: Well, I can send him a message the same way
I try to talk to my mama, and the Gentleman, and

02:43:41.281 --> 02:43:43.642
Kiri sometimes.

02:43:43.642 --> 02:43:46.512
TRAVIS: You send messages to Kiri?

02:43:46.512 --> 02:43:47.448
LAURA: Yeah.

02:43:47.448 --> 02:43:48.669
TRAVIS: What do you say?

02:43:48.669 --> 02:43:53.362
LAURA: Oh, just that she's really cute, and that I
miss her, and I wish I could see her, and I hope

02:43:53.362 --> 02:44:00.798
she's enjoying herself, and that I am sorry that
we haven't seen each other in a while, and that we

02:44:00.798 --> 02:44:03.260
are pirates, and--

02:44:03.260 --> 02:44:06.776
TRAVIS: Can she respond to these messages?

02:44:06.776 --> 02:44:15.976
LAURA: She usually responds with, "We're pirates,
and I miss you, and--"

02:44:15.976 --> 02:44:17.326
TRAVIS: (as Jester) Go fuck yourself.

02:44:17.326 --> 02:44:21.908
LAURA: No, she doesn't say that. She says, "Yes,
I'm very cute," a lot.

02:44:21.908 --> 02:44:27.770
TRAVIS: Right. I suppose, what would you put in
the letter to the Plank King?

02:44:27.770 --> 02:44:30.077
LAURA: Whatever you want me to.

02:44:30.077 --> 02:44:46.318
TRAVIS: I mean, I don't know if it's necessary. I
can't think of anything as of yet. I don't know,

02:44:46.318 --> 02:44:49.215
maybe I'll just let you know. Thank you for
offering, though.

02:44:49.215 --> 02:44:52.864
LAURA: Of course. Your teeth are coming in.

02:44:52.864 --> 02:44:56.159
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:44:56.159 --> 02:45:00.627
LAURA: I saw it peek out of your lip just now.

02:45:00.627 --> 02:45:10.928
TRAVIS: Okay, all right. Yeah. Thank you for not
telling the others.

02:45:10.928 --> 02:45:14.780
LAURA: Of course, Fjord.

02:45:17.539 --> 02:45:20.093
TRAVIS: I've got to go check on Orly, make sure
we're going the right way.

02:45:20.093 --> 02:45:23.075
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to go see if everything's
mended over this way.

02:45:25.032 --> 02:45:27.335
MARISHA: Mended over this way.

02:45:30.282 --> 02:45:33.330
LIAM: Put a piece of paper back together.

02:45:34.798 --> 02:45:43.483
MATT: It's going to take you about a week to get
to the location that you're seeking.

02:45:43.483 --> 02:45:45.703
MARISHA: The boat or the island?

02:45:45.703 --> 02:45:47.720
TRAVIS: The island.

02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:53.393
MATT: No, the island's going to take longer than
that-- to get to where the last time you recall

02:45:53.393 --> 02:45:54.827
your ship going down.

02:45:54.827 --> 02:45:57.037
MARISHA: With our shit all fucked up?

02:45:57.037 --> 02:46:00.966
MATT: Yeah, it would take a shorter time. It's
about eight days or so to get there, eyeballing it

02:46:00.966 --> 02:46:06.432
from here, I'd say. More than that, ten days.

02:46:06.432 --> 02:46:10.741
LAURA: Can we cast Control Water to get us there
faster at all?

02:46:10.741 --> 02:46:12.362
MATT: Do you have access to Control Water?

02:46:12.362 --> 02:46:13.557
LAURA: Of course I do.

02:46:13.557 --> 02:46:14.581
TRAVIS and LIAM: You do?

02:46:14.581 --> 02:46:15.787
MATT: Then yeah.

02:46:15.787 --> 02:46:17.002
LIAM: Oh fuck.

02:46:17.002 --> 02:46:18.651
LAURA: Maybe I can do that every day.

02:46:18.651 --> 02:46:20.930
MATT: Okay. I'll say, with the Control Water--

02:46:20.930 --> 02:46:22.641
TRAVIS: Fucking secrets.

02:46:22.641 --> 02:46:25.824
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I might be able to
do that too.

02:46:26.172 --> 02:46:31.150
SAM: Come on, everyone has Control Water, don't
they? I've got it.

02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:38.648
LIAM: I've been waiting to drop it. Fucking water
genasi heritage, man.

02:46:38.648 --> 02:46:41.956
TALIESIN: Nope, never mind-- oh, yeah, I've got
it, too.

02:46:41.956 --> 02:46:43.320
MATT: It's in the cleric list, yeah.

02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:48.201
MARISHA: It's a cleric-- oh god! d4 just went
flying!

02:46:49.149 --> 02:46:53.868
MATT: Between the two of you, it allows you a
brief moment where you can actually surge the

02:46:53.868 --> 02:47:03.110
water and grant you a speed boost. I'd say that'll
cut three days off of your travel-- the two of

02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:08.242
you, each day, spending that slot to push it. It's
like a speedboat burst. All of a sudden, your

02:47:08.242 --> 02:47:16.012
giant, three-mast ship is going (crashing water),
speedboating across the ocean briefly.

02:47:16.012 --> 02:47:22.239
MARISHA: Is it an event each day? Does the crew
come out and we all join. Like, "Yeah!"

02:47:22.239 --> 02:47:24.539
TALIESIN: It's like in Mary Poppins; everyone
holds the china.

02:47:24.539 --> 02:47:25.644
MARISHA: Exactly!

02:47:25.644 --> 02:47:27.288
TALIESIN: And 12 o'clock.

02:47:27.288 --> 02:47:29.219
MARISHA: And let's go.

02:47:29.219 --> 02:47:31.696
LIAM: You're so stupid, Rose.

02:47:31.696 --> 02:47:37.789
MATT: Eventually, you make your way to the open
waters in the vicinity of-- Orly goes with you

02:47:37.789 --> 02:47:42.789
each day and looks about and gives you the
once-over and goes, "I'm pretty sure that we're

02:47:42.789 --> 02:47:46.433
"pretty dang close to that place you were asking
about."

02:47:46.433 --> 02:47:52.450
TRAVIS: I appreciate that, Orly. Hey, Caduceus, do
you have any way of, I don't know-- you've got

02:47:52.450 --> 02:47:58.362
those vibes, right?-- feeling down and, I don't
know, doing a little ping on the bottom?

02:47:58.430 --> 02:48:01.294
TALIESIN: What do you-- I don't entirely
understand what you're--

02:48:01.294 --> 02:48:05.039
TRAVIS: I don't know, I don't want to put you in a
box or anything, but you seem to pick up the most.

02:48:05.039 --> 02:48:12.543
TALIESIN: You want to see if I get-- oh, for the
ship. I don't know. That's a--

02:48:13.017 --> 02:48:15.500
LAURA: That'd be a Locate Object sort of
situation?

02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:27.094
TALIESIN: I've got Locate Creature. Yeah, we've
both got Locate Object, so we can both help with that.

02:48:27.094 --> 02:48:28.332
SAM: What object?

02:48:28.332 --> 02:48:29.607
LAURA: A ship.

02:48:29.607 --> 02:48:35.921
TRAVIS: I'll summon the falchion and I'll say:
Maybe try to locate this, and I'll point towards

02:48:35.921 --> 02:48:41.003
the eye. Not this eye, but a similar eye.

02:48:41.003 --> 02:48:42.296
LIAM: Do you mean your penis?

02:48:42.296 --> 02:48:43.478
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:48:43.478 --> 02:48:45.411
LAURA: I'm going to do it.

02:48:45.411 --> 02:48:52.038
MATT: Okay. It's a thousand-foot range, and it has
to be something familiar to you.

02:48:52.038 --> 02:48:56.328
TALIESIN: I'm looking for a boat. I'm looking for
a ship. I'm looking for a shipwreck, not an

02:48:56.328 --> 02:48:58.389
object. We could do object, too.

02:48:58.389 --> 02:49:00.415
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to look for his.

02:49:00.415 --> 02:49:07.094
MATT: Okay. That's 2nd-level? It lasts for ten
minutes.

02:49:07.094 --> 02:49:09.460
TALIESIN: So we can take turns.

02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:11.977
MATT: Okay, and how many spell slots do you have
2nd-level each?

02:49:11.977 --> 02:49:13.152
LAURA: Three each.

02:49:13.152 --> 02:49:23.801
MATT: So if you're both trading off, it's about
three chances per type of use per day. How many

02:49:23.801 --> 02:49:27.459
days you want to spend looking total?

02:49:27.459 --> 02:49:28.875
MARISHA: For the boat?

02:49:28.875 --> 02:49:29.889
MATT: Yeah.

02:49:29.889 --> 02:49:31.258
TRAVIS: How long do we have?

02:49:31.258 --> 02:49:32.594
MATT: It's up to you.

02:49:32.594 --> 02:49:34.589
SAM: Do we have unlimited supplies?

02:49:34.589 --> 02:49:36.868
MATT: Well, these guys can summon stuff with
magic, if I recall.

02:49:36.868 --> 02:49:42.642
TALIESIN: Yeah, so the food ain't good, but it's
edible and the water's fine.

02:49:42.642 --> 02:49:46.782
MARISHA: Until we find it.

02:49:46.782 --> 02:49:53.329
TRAVIS: Yeah? What, like two days and then go fix
the boat proper and come back if we have to?

02:49:54.310 --> 02:49:57.196
MARISHA: I don't know. Maybe that's a team
discussion.

02:49:57.618 --> 02:50:02.158
TRAVIS: How about we spend two to three days, and
if we don't find it, we can go and repair the boat

02:50:02.158 --> 02:50:04.328
proper or at least get the materials to do that?

02:50:04.328 --> 02:50:08.723
TALIESIN: We can cast it at level three also,
which is another--

02:50:08.723 --> 02:50:17.061
SAM: If we find it, though, and we go down there--
we can't go down there. Can we go down there?

02:50:17.061 --> 02:50:19.315
TRAVIS: Sure we can.

02:50:19.315 --> 02:50:21.905
SAM: But then we can't make a hasty retreat.

02:50:21.905 --> 02:50:25.709
LAURA: Yeah, it might be smart to have a boat that
actually works before we go down.

02:50:25.709 --> 02:50:28.123
SAM: I guess we could do a recon first.

02:50:28.123 --> 02:50:32.503
MARISHA: There still begs the question of, is
someone else going to come looking for this? Now

02:50:32.503 --> 02:50:33.853
that the Plank King--

02:50:33.853 --> 02:50:35.737
TALIESIN: I like that we're here now.

02:50:35.737 --> 02:50:41.899
MARISHA: We gave the book with the cipher over, so
if anybody else wants it--

02:50:41.899 --> 02:50:44.055
LAURA: Yeah, but we ripped out the page saying
where to find--

02:50:44.055 --> 02:50:49.083
MARISHA: We did! Oh my god!

02:50:49.083 --> 02:50:52.229
LIAM: All the pertinent information is also in
here.

02:50:52.229 --> 02:50:57.979
TRAVIS: Nott, I would leave it at your discretion.
We all have the ability to travel under the waves

02:50:57.979 --> 02:51:00.449
with great ease.

02:51:00.449 --> 02:51:05.382
SAM: We do? How? I don't.

02:51:05.382 --> 02:51:11.118
TRAVIS: I have a way of making it so that water
becomes like air for you down there.

02:51:11.118 --> 02:51:15.926
SAM: Does it feel like water?

02:51:15.926 --> 02:51:22.107
TRAVIS: It feels a little thicker, like if you
were in a really dense fog, maybe?

02:51:22.107 --> 02:51:24.269
SAM: But it's still water?

02:51:24.269 --> 02:51:25.763
TRAVIS: It is.

02:51:25.763 --> 02:51:31.657
LAURA: But you can breathe it, so it's really
not.

02:51:31.657 --> 02:51:36.086
TRAVIS: Or you could stay above if you wanted to
send a Message if some trouble appears on the

02:51:36.086 --> 02:51:40.679
horizon, I'd just hate to leave you behind on such
a great adventure. There could be buttons, there

02:51:40.679 --> 02:51:43.842
could be little jewels, ingots--

02:51:43.842 --> 02:51:48.201
SAM: Don't you talk down to me. I know what you're
up to.

02:51:48.201 --> 02:51:51.148
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? Iit's the
bottom of the ocean. Ships throw people all the time.

02:51:51.148 --> 02:51:54.938
LIAM: Full disclosure, I could help you cope
with--

02:51:54.938 --> 02:51:57.959
SAM: He thinks I'm going to go into the water for
some fucking buttons.

02:51:57.959 --> 02:52:02.513
TRAVIS: I heard tell there was a button ship that
crashed right along the water.

02:52:02.513 --> 02:52:10.634
SAM: Oh, the old button ship legend, really?! Oh!
Buttonbeard the Pirate?!

02:52:10.634 --> 02:52:11.408
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:52:11.408 --> 02:52:14.075
SAM: He had buttons for beards!

02:52:14.075 --> 02:52:21.506
LIAM: Nott the Brave. We have things to accomplish
here. If you allow me, I could do what I have done

02:52:21.506 --> 02:52:28.961
in the past a little sneakily to help you cope
with this fear you have. If you allow me.

02:52:28.961 --> 02:52:35.704
SAM: I appreciate that, Caleb, but I've got my own
way of doing it.

02:52:35.704 --> 02:52:39.407
LIAM: Is it Mike Myers?

02:52:39.612 --> 02:52:43.877
TRAVIS: There might be bronzed shoes, maybe little
silver cups. Decoder rings.

02:52:43.877 --> 02:52:50.800
SAM: Ooh, those spoons? The little spoons, the
collectible ones? Fuck this guy.

02:52:51.890 --> 02:52:57.620
LIAM: We're not there yet, though, we're talking
in advance at this point? All in advance?

02:52:57.620 --> 02:52:58.462
LAURA: Yeah.

02:52:58.462 --> 02:53:00.322
TRAVIS: We're coming upon the area, right?

02:53:00.322 --> 02:53:09.479
MATT: Altogether with the eight of them, it cuts
the travel time down to five days. So you've got time.

02:53:09.479 --> 02:53:11.725
SAM: I'll think about it.

02:53:11.725 --> 02:53:15.844
TALIESIN: I'm going to be stocking us up on food
too, so that there's more than enough food and

02:53:15.844 --> 02:53:17.457
water for the whole group.

02:53:17.457 --> 02:53:26.349
SAM: Pewter? Plates? Those little collectible
plates from the Stanford Mint or whatever?

02:53:26.349 --> 02:53:30.721
LAURA: So we're going to hang around this area
before we get to the boat wrecks, yeah?

02:53:30.721 --> 02:53:32.406
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think so.

02:53:32.406 --> 02:53:33.396
LAURA: Okay.

02:53:33.396 --> 02:53:41.958
MATT: Okay, so taking your time, I would like you
to each to roll a base wisdom check for each pass

02:53:41.958 --> 02:53:44.987
as you go through.

02:53:44.987 --> 02:53:47.444
SAM: You two, right?

02:53:47.444 --> 02:53:51.370
MATT: Yes. d20 plus your wisdom modifier.

02:53:51.370 --> 02:53:53.002
TALIESIN: 19.

02:53:53.002 --> 02:53:54.102
LAURA: 12.

02:53:54.102 --> 02:53:56.201
MATT: Okay. Again.

02:53:58.630 --> 02:54:01.437
LAURA: God. Nine.

02:54:01.437 --> 02:54:05.515
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm doing save. I'm so sorry. Fuck,
I was doing the wrong--

02:54:05.515 --> 02:54:06.867
LAURA: Oh, shit! I was, too.

02:54:06.867 --> 02:54:08.561
MATT: This is just check. Add your wisdom
modifier.

02:54:08.561 --> 02:54:10.294
LAURA: Even lower.

02:54:10.294 --> 02:54:17.299
TALIESIN: I said 19? 16, and then 19.

02:54:17.299 --> 02:54:25.081
MATT: Okay. Roll again. Your third spell slot of
the first day, hitting this space and scanning the load.

02:54:25.688 --> 02:54:26.653
LAURA: 15.

02:54:26.653 --> 02:54:28.076
TALIESIN: 14.

02:54:28.489 --> 02:54:36.027
MATT: Okay, and you're utilizing your memory of
passage through here, as well as Orly's direction

02:54:36.027 --> 02:54:43.444
on this ocean. Go ahead and roll an intelligence
check for me.

02:54:48.137 --> 02:54:49.723
TRAVIS: 13.

02:54:49.723 --> 02:54:58.866
MATT: Okay. First day goes through. Nothing
catches your attention. You pass around, and then

02:54:58.866 --> 02:55:04.580
once you make it quite past the area, based on the
measurements, where you think that you recall it

02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:11.416
happening. The next day, you make a curved turn
and begin to head out to see some more land, as

02:55:11.416 --> 02:55:19.117
you can, to widen the perspective of your search.
For the second day, roll again.

02:55:20.676 --> 02:55:22.376
TALIESIN: Three?

02:55:22.376 --> 02:55:26.448
MATT: Three in a row, yeah. Unless you want to use
more spell slots to do more. So you can do your

02:55:26.448 --> 02:55:28.298
3rd-level to burn as well.

02:55:28.298 --> 02:55:31.109
LAURA: That's true. 20 on the first roll.

02:55:31.109 --> 02:55:33.596
TALIESIN: 20 on the first roll.

02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:36.454
LAURA: Lame on the second roll.

02:55:36.454 --> 02:55:38.219
TALIESIN: 14 on the second roll.

02:55:38.219 --> 02:55:42.501
MATT: (sneezes) Pardon me. Thank you. (sneezes)
Pardon. Thank you.

02:55:42.501 --> 02:55:44.138
SAM: You're a three-sneezer?

02:55:44.138 --> 02:55:46.241
MATT: I am, at least.

02:55:46.241 --> 02:55:47.971
LAURA: Should we try one more?

02:55:47.971 --> 02:55:51.771
TALIESIN: 16, 19. Yeah, let's blow another. What
else are we going to do for the day?

02:55:51.771 --> 02:55:52.547
MATT: Sure.

02:55:52.547 --> 02:55:55.662
LAURA: Motherfuck!

02:55:56.052 --> 02:55:57.407
TALIESIN: 24.

02:55:57.407 --> 02:55:58.658
LAURA: Six.

02:55:58.658 --> 02:56:01.247
MATT: Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for
you as well.

02:56:01.247 --> 02:56:02.859
MARISHA: Come on!

02:56:02.859 --> 02:56:04.714
LIAM: "Fuh-jord-y!"

02:56:05.237 --> 02:56:06.474
TRAVIS: 11.

02:56:06.474 --> 02:56:21.845
MATT: Okay. You go through the second day, and
towards the end, you, Caduceus, sense a brief

02:56:21.845 --> 02:56:29.163
moment where something ship-related catches your
attention, and then is gone.

02:56:29.163 --> 02:56:31.448
TALIESIN: I had a moment.

02:56:31.448 --> 02:56:32.439
TRAVIS: You did?

02:56:32.439 --> 02:56:36.060
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's gone now. Would I know
direction, even?

02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:38.193
MATT: Vague direction.

02:56:38.193 --> 02:56:39.364
TALIESIN: But we're moving, I know.

02:56:39.364 --> 02:56:42.097
MATT: Yeah, you're moving. So it's like, all
right, let's go ahead and turn it around.

02:56:42.097 --> 02:56:44.658
SAM: Just point. Caleb will know the direction.

02:56:44.658 --> 02:56:49.668
MATT: You turn the ship back in the direction of
where it goes. At the very end of the second day,

02:56:49.668 --> 02:56:57.954
just as dusk is starting to creep in, you make
your way back in the area, and you sense another hit.

02:56:57.954 --> 02:57:02.326
LAURA: Ooh. Should I use another 3rd-level spell
and try to find the orb-y thing?

02:57:02.326 --> 02:57:04.789
TALIESIN: Let's do one more.

02:57:04.789 --> 02:57:10.250
MATT: Okay. As you're attempting to find the orb,
roll a wisdom check.

02:57:10.250 --> 02:57:14.206
TALIESIN: I'll also join in for one more for that
as well. It's my last spell slot.

02:57:14.206 --> 02:57:16.888
MATT: Okay. You lose your concentration on the
Locate Object.

02:57:16.888 --> 02:57:21.986
TALIESIN: Oh. Okay, I'm still holding the boat.
That's fine.

02:57:21.986 --> 02:57:28.328
MATT: You circle around again. You've closed off a
distance, but you haven't quite located the

02:57:28.328 --> 02:57:33.324
specific area yet. You're trying to guide into a
vicinity. I mean, it's hard to really remember

02:57:33.324 --> 02:57:38.744
specifically where, when it's just open water and
a storm looming, especially. So you get to a

02:57:38.744 --> 02:57:42.200
certain point where you're like, I'm not sure I'm
being able to help, but you're starting to get

02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:47.470
something. You're not entirely sure. The
divination seems to be helping, or this aspect of

02:57:47.470 --> 02:57:56.051
your Locate spell. Evening comes to a close. You
ride the night out. The clouds are still thick.

02:57:56.051 --> 02:58:02.437
The next morning, you can attempt again if you
like, both of you.

02:58:02.437 --> 02:58:05.021
TRAVIS: Come on, you got it.

02:58:05.021 --> 02:58:07.360
SAM: Bless or something. Do a Bless!

02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:09.189
LAURA: I don't have Bless!

02:58:09.189 --> 02:58:10.296
SAM: No, he does.

02:58:10.296 --> 02:58:11.101
TALIESIN: I do.

02:58:11.101 --> 02:58:12.124
LAURA: Bless us!

02:58:12.124 --> 02:58:13.730
MATT: Make another intelligence check for me as
well.

02:58:13.730 --> 02:58:15.268
TALIESIN: Actually, this is a check, not a save,
so it wouldn't--

02:58:15.268 --> 02:58:21.893
LAURA: Oh, and I want to learn the cantrip
Guidance, but I don't know any good healers that

02:58:21.893 --> 02:58:24.169
can teach it to me.

02:58:24.169 --> 02:58:26.429
MARISHA: Druids can teach it, too.

02:58:27.126 --> 02:58:28.005
LAURA: 18.

02:58:28.005 --> 02:58:29.008
TALIESIN: 15.

02:58:29.008 --> 02:58:30.033
TRAVIS: 20.

02:58:30.033 --> 02:58:33.621
MATT: Okay. Roll again.

02:58:33.621 --> 02:58:36.168
SAM: One last one.

02:58:36.168 --> 02:58:37.789
MATT: This is your second spell slot used
today?

02:58:37.789 --> 02:58:38.818
TALIESIN: 19.

02:58:38.818 --> 02:58:40.645
LAURA: Motherfuck. I'm going to use a third.

02:58:40.645 --> 02:58:41.944
TALIESIN: That was my third, was 19.

02:58:41.944 --> 02:58:45.680
MATT: Okay.

02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:47.792
LAURA: 21.

02:58:47.792 --> 02:58:52.527
MATT: Okay. Between the 21 and your 20 intellect
in guiding the ship around, you find yourself now

02:58:52.527 --> 02:58:57.118
collecting a secondary blip. Once again, on the
ship, not on the eye.

02:58:57.118 --> 02:58:58.413
LAURA: I was on the orb.

02:58:58.413 --> 02:59:00.082
MATT: You're concentrating on the orb, or the
ship?

02:59:00.082 --> 02:59:01.460
LAURA: I was concentrating on the ball.

02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:04.213
MATT: The ball? You find nothing.

02:59:04.213 --> 02:59:12.608
TRAVIS: I think that means it's probably not down
there, but I'd still like to take a look.

02:59:12.608 --> 02:59:14.753
LIAM: Are we close? What are you telling us?

02:59:14.753 --> 02:59:19.208
TRAVIS: I think so. We're starting to round an
area that I think we could probably fan out and

02:59:19.208 --> 02:59:22.588
explore amongst the seven of us.

02:59:22.798 --> 02:59:34.808
LIAM: I just got my cat back, but if you want an
octopus to look on the bottom, you have it.

02:59:34.808 --> 02:59:36.249
TALIESIN: That's a very good idea.

02:59:36.249 --> 02:59:40.487
TRAVIS: That is, actually. If it wouldn't be too
much trouble, Caleb, that would be--

02:59:40.487 --> 02:59:48.904
LIAM: Yeah, I have just enough incense to-- yeah
sure, let's make an octopus. Cat-shaped. An

02:59:48.904 --> 02:59:50.773
octopus-shaped cat.

02:59:50.773 --> 02:59:54.105
MARISHA: Oh wow. How far does your octopus'
connection go for?

02:59:54.105 --> 02:59:58.679
LIAM: Well, I can tell him to go look and he'll
come back to me. I can see through him for--

02:59:58.679 --> 03:00:01.045
MARISHA: Yeah, but how far is your connection?

03:00:01.045 --> 03:00:09.884
LIAM: It's a thousand feet. To watch, but he can
go and come back, and I trust him. He's Frumpkin.

03:00:09.884 --> 03:00:18.065
I pull out my book and I set it on the deck and I
start working on turning my cat into an octopus.

03:00:18.065 --> 03:00:20.551
SAM: Does this mean we don't have to go in the
water?

03:00:20.551 --> 03:00:22.943
TALIESIN: Oh, this means we'll probably have to go
in the water.

03:00:22.943 --> 03:00:25.715
SAM: What? Why? He's got an octopus.

03:00:25.715 --> 03:00:29.564
LIAM: An hour later, an octopus pops out, if we
wait that long.

03:00:29.564 --> 03:00:31.637
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd be okay with it.

03:00:31.637 --> 03:00:33.268
MATT: So you create a Frumpkin octopus.

03:00:33.268 --> 03:00:40.379
LIAM: Yeah. (sighs) Well, we had one or two days
together. Just throw him off.

03:00:40.379 --> 03:00:46.407
MATT: (splashing) Frumpkin makes his way in the
darkness.

03:00:46.407 --> 03:00:50.128
TALIESIN: I'm also going to put Bless on the
octopus before it.

03:00:50.128 --> 03:00:52.071
MATT: Okay. How long does it last?

03:00:52.071 --> 03:00:57.000
TALIESIN: It's one minute.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:04.153
LIAM: So I'll watch for the first thousand feet,
but I assume he goes beyond that, because it's the

03:01:04.153 --> 03:01:11.814
ocean, so he keeps going down and down and down. I
will tell him to look for this wreck, for what we

03:01:11.814 --> 03:01:15.163
are looking for, and when he finds it to come back
and tell me about it.

03:01:15.163 --> 03:01:17.613
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for Frumpkin.

03:01:21.313 --> 03:01:22.533
LIAM: 13.

03:01:22.533 --> 03:01:31.216
MATT: Okay. About an hour goes by. Nothing. Roll
again.

03:01:34.454 --> 03:01:35.976
LIAM: 17.

03:01:35.976 --> 03:01:44.812
MATT: Frumpkin goes beyond your visual range for a
bit. You start getting worried, and then Frumpkin

03:01:44.812 --> 03:01:50.460
returns and is making his way quickly towards the
ship.

03:01:50.460 --> 03:01:52.895
LIAM: If he's within 1000, we have a connection.

03:01:52.895 --> 03:01:54.172
MATT: 100-foot is the connection.

03:01:54.172 --> 03:01:55.273
LIAM: A hundred? Thank you.

03:01:55.273 --> 03:01:58.232
MARISHA: Maybe he'll see Dashilla.

03:01:58.232 --> 03:01:59.598
LIAM: Maybe it's 10,000.

03:01:59.598 --> 03:02:04.748
MATT: Technically, the distance doesn't matter for
what you can see through his eyes. It's a 100 feet

03:02:04.748 --> 03:02:05.885
for it to communicate.

03:02:05.885 --> 03:02:09.775
LIAM: Right, we've established that. I can see
indefinitely. That's what we established early in

03:02:09.775 --> 03:02:13.447
the campaign with the circus, but I can't
communicate with him.

03:02:13.447 --> 03:02:18.538
MATT: Correct, during that time. So yeah, you
watch through Frumpkin's eyes as he makes his way

03:02:18.538 --> 03:02:29.436
toward the-- finally finding the floor of this
ocean. Over this second hour of his search, he

03:02:29.436 --> 03:02:36.280
catches one shape that is emerging like an obelisk
on the bottom of the ocean. Upon getting close

03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:46.645
enough, you can see it looks to be the front of a
wrecked ship, itself damaged and caked in

03:02:46.645 --> 03:02:56.233
minerals, ocean floor plant life, barnacles. It
appears to be a damaged ship.

03:02:59.503 --> 03:03:01.659
SAM: Does it have a name?

03:03:01.722 --> 03:03:03.564
LIAM: I don't hear any of you.

03:03:03.564 --> 03:03:05.527
SAM: (shouting) Does it have a name?

03:03:05.527 --> 03:03:08.052
MARISHA: You're in my ear. Ow!

03:03:08.052 --> 03:03:10.195
SAM: Sorry.

03:03:10.195 --> 03:03:15.580
LIAM: Ooh, he has found the ship. This is a
reminder I can't hear any of you. I don't want to

03:03:15.580 --> 03:03:19.786
disconnect. Don't give me wet willies.

03:03:19.786 --> 03:03:21.717
LAURA: I give him a wet willie.

03:03:21.717 --> 03:03:25.107
SAM: Six wet willies.

03:03:25.107 --> 03:03:27.838
TRAVIS: His ears are just dripping saliva.

03:03:27.838 --> 03:03:30.925
MATT and LAURA: (groaning)

03:03:30.925 --> 03:03:37.332
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin does a circle on it, before
feeling confident that he's discovered at least

03:03:37.332 --> 03:03:44.064
something of interest, and then beelines it back
to the Squalleater.

03:03:44.064 --> 03:03:51.081
LIAM: Who's a good boy?! You are the best cat that
was ever put on this planet!

03:03:51.081 --> 03:03:54.182
MATT: Then Frumpkin is now there at the surface of
the water, without really a way getting back into

03:03:54.182 --> 03:03:55.330
the ship.

03:03:55.330 --> 03:03:57.077
LIAM: Oh yeah?

03:03:57.077 --> 03:03:58.850
MATT: Yeah, there you go, back in your shoulder.

03:03:58.850 --> 03:04:05.626
LIAM: Oh, come here you. You are the most
important member of this team and don't let

03:04:05.626 --> 03:04:10.036
Beauregard tell you different. Or Nott.

03:04:10.036 --> 03:04:14.200
MARISHA: Do you ever feel like your relationship
with your cat is hindering building stronger

03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:16.491
relationships with human people?

03:04:16.491 --> 03:04:18.204
SAM: I've told him that a lot of times.

03:04:18.204 --> 03:04:22.084
MARISHA: I feel concerned about you sometimes.

03:04:22.226 --> 03:04:25.310
LIAM: Yeah, that is so silly, isn't it? Silly, yes
it is.

03:04:25.310 --> 03:04:27.916
SAM: Tell us what he found!

03:04:27.916 --> 03:04:34.595
LIAM: He found the boat, Nott. he found the boat. He will
lead us to the boat. He found it. He did it.

03:04:34.595 --> 03:04:35.976
SAM: That's great.

03:04:35.976 --> 03:04:43.483
TRAVIS: That is great news. Does anybody not
want to join? Really? You want to stay up here?

03:04:43.483 --> 03:04:46.332
SAM: How far down is it?

03:04:46.332 --> 03:04:48.103
LIAM: It's the bottom of the ocean.

03:04:48.103 --> 03:04:49.515
SAM: And how far is that?

03:04:49.515 --> 03:04:51.454
LIAM: It's thousands of feet.

03:04:51.454 --> 03:04:52.940
LAURA: No, it wasn't a thousand.

03:04:52.940 --> 03:04:54.502
LIAM: Thousands of feet.

03:04:54.502 --> 03:04:56.629
MATT: Over an hour.

03:04:56.629 --> 03:04:59.812
SAM: Ugh, fuck that. No way!

03:04:59.812 --> 03:05:05.408
MATT: Like, just barely. From the distance where
you are now. It'd be just under a thousand if you

03:05:05.408 --> 03:05:10.892
were right over, but you're not entirely certain
how far. The boat isn't set for that currently.

03:05:10.892 --> 03:05:12.823
LIAM: You have a method to bring us down there.

03:05:12.823 --> 03:05:13.750
SAM: What is this method?

03:05:13.750 --> 03:05:16.432
LIAM: Describe it to me. I've read a bit. Explain
it to the goblin.

03:05:16.432 --> 03:05:23.423
TRAVIS: I'll cast a little-- on you and for 24
hours, you can breathe underwater freely.

03:05:23.423 --> 03:05:24.835
LIAM: That is a whole day.

03:05:24.835 --> 03:05:27.173
SAM: But you still have to move through the water,
you still have to swim through it--

03:05:27.173 --> 03:05:30.501
TRAVIS: Yeah. You could hold onto my shoulders if
you wanted to.

03:05:30.501 --> 03:05:33.380
MARISHA: Could we give ourselves some weights to
get us down there?

03:05:33.380 --> 03:05:35.542
MATT: You've got weight.

03:05:35.542 --> 03:05:37.994
MARISHA: Concrete shoes!

03:05:37.994 --> 03:05:40.671
SAM: Sounds terrifying.

03:05:40.671 --> 03:05:43.141
TRAVIS: Actually, we could take a few of the
cannonballs to just--

03:05:43.141 --> 03:05:44.891
MARISHA: We should have weights that weigh us down
there.

03:05:44.891 --> 03:05:50.044
LAURA: Will the breathing underwater, will that
make it to where our ears won't hurt really bad?

03:05:50.044 --> 03:05:53.357
Because I hear when you go down underwater, your
ears hurt really bad.

03:05:53.357 --> 03:05:55.554
TRAVIS: That's because of the air. You're going to
have to equalize.

03:05:55.554 --> 03:05:57.292
SAM: Your ears hurt bad too? Jesus.

03:05:57.292 --> 03:06:00.376
TRAVIS: But if you're breathing water, there's no
air to expand or contract.

03:06:00.376 --> 03:06:04.575
MARISHA: Won't you crush under the pressure of the
water after a certain point?.

03:06:04.575 --> 03:06:08.531
TRAVIS: After a certain depth. There's only one
way to find out.

03:06:08.531 --> 03:06:14.569
LIAM: Now, you people have not read about-- you
don't understand magic. It's not like that. I want

03:06:14.569 --> 03:06:16.230
to try this.

03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:22.098
TRAVIS: I know. I do, too. Those that want to
join, join me at the rail. I'll jump on and sit on the rail.

03:06:22.098 --> 03:06:25.307
LAURA: No, wait! We have to get a good night's
sleep. We just used all of our spells finding this shit!

03:06:25.307 --> 03:06:28.783
MARISHA: Oh yeah. That's a good point.

03:06:28.783 --> 03:06:33.458
TALIESIN: Let's have them. Let's tell the crew
what's up. Early in the morning, at first light.

03:06:33.458 --> 03:06:36.605
LIAM: It's too late. Fjord's in the water,
swimming around.

03:06:36.605 --> 03:06:37.879
MARISHA: Caduceus, you making breakfast?

03:06:37.879 --> 03:06:41.581
TALIESIN: I'm always making breakfast. I'm not
going to even use the weird plants.

03:06:41.581 --> 03:06:43.701
MARISHA: I'll get up for Caduceus' breakfast.

03:06:43.701 --> 03:06:47.445
TALIESIN: I've been putting that weird fruit in
everyone's food for a week now, by the way. Just

03:06:47.445 --> 03:06:48.947
so we're clear.

03:06:48.947 --> 03:06:50.263
LIAM: In minimal amounts, or full dose?

03:06:50.263 --> 03:06:51.549
MATT: The stuff that you found at Urukayxl?

03:06:51.549 --> 03:06:52.970
TALIESIN: Just kidding, but wouldn't that be
great?

03:06:52.970 --> 03:06:54.046
MATT: That would be amazing

03:06:54.046 --> 03:06:55.871
TALIESIN: Everyone's just be like, "Wow!"

03:06:55.871 --> 03:07:01.132
LIAM: There was no battle. There was no battle
with Avantika, man!

03:07:01.132 --> 03:07:03.462
TRAVIS: We're not on the boat, we're in sand.

03:07:03.462 --> 03:07:04.858
LAURA: There's no nothing.

03:07:04.858 --> 03:07:08.990
LIAM: We're sitting in your mom's sitting room
right now.

03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:13.661
MATT: You look up and on the side, there's the
Plank King and Avantika looking at him. He's like,

03:07:13.661 --> 03:07:15.318
"Where you'd find these people?"

03:07:15.318 --> 03:07:19.540
(laughter)

03:07:19.540 --> 03:07:26.674
MATT: All right, so you guys have another night's
rest. As you wake up the next morning, it is

03:07:26.674 --> 03:07:32.719
raining. There appears to be a small storm making
its way in there.

03:07:32.719 --> 03:07:37.136
MARISHA: Are the fish out? Fish always come out
when it rains.

03:07:37.136 --> 03:07:46.817
MATT: Well, once you make it in the ocean, you'll
find out. Noticeably, Yasha is energized with the

03:07:46.817 --> 03:07:54.664
coming of the storm. Seems to be in more energetic
spirits than you're used to seeing her. You guys

03:07:54.664 --> 03:07:59.044
complete your meal for breakfast. You gather your
supplies. What are you going to do?

03:07:59.044 --> 03:08:04.715
TRAVIS: I'll leave Orly in command while we head
under. To complete this spell, I'm going to need

03:08:04.715 --> 03:08:07.634
everyone to hold hands in a circle.

03:08:07.634 --> 03:08:15.734
MARISHA: I would like to sing a little Kumbaya
song and refresh everybody on the Diver's Grave,

03:08:15.734 --> 03:08:18.303
which is where we are.

03:08:18.303 --> 03:08:19.790
SAM: Are you going to sing that Diver's Grave
song?

03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:22.907
MARISHA: (singing) Kumbaya, the cursed woman--

03:08:22.907 --> 03:08:24.980
LAURA: (singing) Dashilla the Dreadful--

03:08:24.980 --> 03:08:30.119
MARISHA: (singing) Kumbaya Dashilla, Dashilla with
claws that grasp.

03:08:30.119 --> 03:08:32.193
TRAVIS: Do we need to have the rights to that
song?

03:08:32.193 --> 03:08:34.240
MARISHA: (singing) Oh god I hope not.

03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:35.719
LAURA: (singing) And a hungry eye.

03:08:35.719 --> 03:08:40.948
MARISHA: (singing) She's got a hungry eye and with
a lantern light. Dashilla, the cursed woman,

03:08:40.948 --> 03:08:43.310
treasures in her eyes.

03:08:43.310 --> 03:08:44.727
SAM: This is nice.

03:08:44.727 --> 03:08:46.002
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. Cool.

03:08:46.002 --> 03:08:47.802
MARISHA: (singing) Dashilla the cursed.

03:08:47.802 --> 03:08:49.746
LIAM: I am casting Mage Armor during whatever the
fuck this is.

03:08:49.746 --> 03:08:50.378
MATT: Okay.

03:08:50.378 --> 03:08:51.504
SAM: That was good.

03:08:51.504 --> 03:08:52.624
MARISHA: I'm just saying.

03:08:52.624 --> 03:08:56.568
LAURA: Did you give us anything for that? Did we
get bonuses or did we just get to hear you sing?

03:08:56.568 --> 03:08:59.533
MARISHA: No, that was Keyleth. Sorry.

03:08:59.533 --> 03:09:02.174
LAURA: It was literally just Beau singing.

03:09:02.174 --> 03:09:04.131
MARISHA: Just me trying to do--

03:09:04.131 --> 03:09:07.007
TRAVIS: Well, while it's happening, because it was
such a good song, I will cast Underwater Breathing

03:09:07.007 --> 03:09:09.651
on all seven of us.

03:09:09.651 --> 03:09:13.367
MARISHA: My song was that good.

03:09:13.367 --> 03:09:18.013
MATT: All right, all of you now have the
capability for the next 24 hours to breathe

03:09:18.013 --> 03:09:24.581
underwater. Your lungs feel heavier than they do
while you breathe air. It's unique. No gills

03:09:24.581 --> 03:09:30.688
sprout from the side of your neck, per se, but the
air itself seems to have a weight to it, and

03:09:30.688 --> 03:09:36.340
you're like (exhales). It's still breathable air,
but the process seems to have changed a bit.

03:09:36.340 --> 03:09:37.689
LIAM: It's the abyss.

03:09:37.689 --> 03:09:45.028
MARISHA: In preparation for this, I went and I
gathered a few sandbags. Took some burlap, filled

03:09:45.028 --> 03:09:47.085
them with--

03:09:47.085 --> 03:09:49.259
MATT: There's no sand to fill them with out in the
ocean, unfortunately.

03:09:49.259 --> 03:09:50.562
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:09:50.562 --> 03:09:51.800
TRAVIS: Cannonballs?

03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:54.612
MARISHA: Okay, yeah sure. I got the
eight-pounders.

03:09:54.612 --> 03:09:56.102
SAM: You have to clear that with me.

03:09:56.102 --> 03:09:59.612
MARISHA: I brought out a few-- but look, I'm the
barrel person.

03:09:59.612 --> 03:10:05.704
MATT: As a note, too, when the Squalleater came to
port that night, Darktow was resupplied with

03:10:05.704 --> 03:10:09.939
cannonballs on board. For those who are keeping
track, which would be--

03:10:09.939 --> 03:10:10.975
SAM: Me!

03:10:10.975 --> 03:10:17.522
MATT: You. The ship currently has a cache of 30
cannonballs.

03:10:17.522 --> 03:10:21.118
SAM: Nice. How many are you taking?

03:10:21.118 --> 03:10:25.518
TRAVIS: Well, we could just use four and have two
people hold on to the same cannonball.

03:10:25.518 --> 03:10:30.649
LIAM: Yeah, that makes sense. Nott and I are
sharing one.

03:10:30.649 --> 03:10:35.761
MATT: Okay. You maneuver the boat slowly also
closer to where Frumpkin saw because when Frumpkin

03:10:35.761 --> 03:10:39.699
found it, it was at an angle away from you, which
is how it was just beyond the range of a thousand

03:10:39.699 --> 03:10:45.301
feet. Moving over, it's probably close to 700 feet
below.

03:10:45.301 --> 03:10:49.294
LIAM: So Frumpkin is pinwheeling in front of all
of us leading the way.

03:10:49.294 --> 03:10:50.499
MATT: Okay.

03:10:50.499 --> 03:10:53.048
TRAVIS: I don't suppose we have 700 feet of rope
on this ship, do we?

03:10:53.048 --> 03:10:56.419
LAURA: Probably not.

03:10:56.419 --> 03:11:00.577
SAM: We have an anchor. It can only go down so
far, but I don't know how--

03:11:00.577 --> 03:11:02.228
MARISHA: That's true. How far does the anchor go?

03:11:02.228 --> 03:11:04.067
SAM: 200 feet? 100 feet?

03:11:04.067 --> 03:11:05.415
MATT: It's not going to go that far.

03:11:05.415 --> 03:11:09.452
LIAM: No, ships don't go to anchor in the middle
of the ocean. They just float.

03:11:09.452 --> 03:11:14.805
TRAVIS: If you're ready, take a seat on the rail
and I'll hop up and put my butt out towards the sea.

03:11:14.805 --> 03:11:16.363
LAURA: It's going to be dark down there.

03:11:16.363 --> 03:11:17.832
MARISHA: Do we have light spells?

03:11:17.832 --> 03:11:19.517
LAURA: I don't.

03:11:19.517 --> 03:11:20.749
TRAVIS: Yasha does.

03:11:20.749 --> 03:11:21.823
TALIESIN: I do.

03:11:21.823 --> 03:11:23.355
LIAM: (popping)

03:11:23.355 --> 03:11:25.106
MATT: Dancing Lights. You cast Light on?

03:11:25.106 --> 03:11:26.184
TALIESIN: On my staff.

03:11:26.184 --> 03:11:28.425
MATT: Yasha casts Light on her sword, the
Magician's Judge.

03:11:28.425 --> 03:11:29.723
SAM: I need a minute!

03:11:29.723 --> 03:11:30.771
TRAVIS: You need a minute?

03:11:30.771 --> 03:11:32.684
SAM: I'm going to drink heavily.

03:11:32.684 --> 03:11:34.795
MATT: To the point where you're intoxicated?

03:11:34.795 --> 03:11:36.379
SAM: To the point of intoxication.

03:11:36.379 --> 03:11:37.272
MATT: Okay.

03:11:37.272 --> 03:11:45.506
LIAM: That's important because I switched the
Transmuter's Stone away from darkvision, so I

03:11:45.506 --> 03:11:50.173
cannot see in low light, so it's got to be guiding
lights for me.

03:11:50.173 --> 03:11:54.637
LAURA: I'm going to take Sprinkle out of my
hood--

03:11:54.637 --> 03:11:56.000
TRAVIS: Ah, smart.

03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.569
MARISHA: Oh, buddy.

03:11:58.569 --> 03:12:04.606
MATT: This poor little-- it's better over the days
that it's been able to spend with you since

03:12:04.606 --> 03:12:08.894
Darktow, but this ferret's been through quite a
few experiences.

03:12:08.894 --> 03:12:16.416
LAURA: You're like a super ferret. You're like the
strongest little animal I've ever seen. I mean, really.

03:12:16.416 --> 03:12:19.433
MATT: (ferret chattering) Then he curls up. He
hears a loud noise (startled chittering).

03:12:19.433 --> 03:12:20.654
TALIESIN: Scarred for life.

03:12:20.654 --> 03:12:22.189
TRAVIS: He's just fucked.

03:12:22.189 --> 03:12:23.478
LAURA: Orly?

03:12:23.478 --> 03:12:24.842
MARISHA: He's a rescue.

03:12:24.842 --> 03:12:29.659
MATT: "Hmm?" I can't remember which eye it is
anymore. I'll have to go check. "Mmm?"

03:12:29.659 --> 03:12:35.201
LAURA: Do you like weasels?

03:12:35.201 --> 03:12:38.046
SAM: That's a weird opener.

03:12:38.046 --> 03:12:40.815
TALIESIN: It never ends well. There's no right
answer to that question.

03:12:40.815 --> 03:12:42.030
MATT: "Why?"

03:12:42.030 --> 03:12:45.770
LAURA: I have a weasel and I don't want to take
him underwater.

03:12:45.770 --> 03:12:47.722
TALIESIN: Water weasel.

03:12:47.722 --> 03:12:52.633
MATT: You watch as Orly's head retracts into the
shell slightly with this look of--

03:12:52.633 --> 03:12:54.336
LAURA: Orly.

03:12:54.336 --> 03:13:00.389
MATT: Marius steps up and goes like, "I'm happy to
look after him. Actually been quite a while since

03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:02.293
"I've seen a pet."

03:13:02.293 --> 03:13:03.639
MARISHA: Wait. Who said that?

03:13:03.639 --> 03:13:05.290
SAM and MATT: Marius LePual.

03:13:05.290 --> 03:13:08.578
MATT: Who you've dragged all the way from
Nicodranas--

03:13:08.578 --> 03:13:12.437
TRAVIS: But he's got a good tan now and some
scars, his clothes are kind of fucked up.

03:13:12.437 --> 03:13:15.212
LAURA: He's like Guy Threepwood now.

03:13:15.212 --> 03:13:19.558
MATT: He does look a little more ocean-wearied. As
prim and proper and put together as Marius was at

03:13:19.558 --> 03:13:23.561
Nicodranas, he's definitely rocking more of a
Pirates of Penzance thing now.

03:13:23.561 --> 03:13:27.682
LIAM: He went from level two to three. Doing
good.

03:13:27.682 --> 03:13:29.932
LAURA: You'll take good care of him?

03:13:29.932 --> 03:13:31.061
MATT: "Of course!"

03:13:31.061 --> 03:13:37.556
LAURA: If you don't, I will know and I will give
you a tattoo. If you do take good care of him,

03:13:37.556 --> 03:13:41.957
though, I will give you a better tattoo.

03:13:41.957 --> 03:13:44.651
MATT: "Are those the only options?"

03:13:44.651 --> 03:13:46.664
LAURA: I mean, if you want.

03:13:46.664 --> 03:13:49.921
MATT: "Okay. Hello-- oh!" (nervous laughter)

03:13:49.921 --> 03:13:56.309
LAURA: He likes to eat fruit. He likes to eat
cheese. He likes to eat bugs.

03:13:56.309 --> 03:13:57.600
MATT: "Right."

03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:00.718
SAM: I think we only have the one food that you've
been creating on the ship.

03:14:00.718 --> 03:14:02.432
LAURA: He likes it if you talk to him.

03:14:02.432 --> 03:14:03.414
TALIESIN: We have bugs and cheese.

03:14:03.414 --> 03:14:04.332
LAURA: Yeah, we got bugs and cheese.

03:14:04.332 --> 03:14:10.438
MATT: "Okay. Well, come. Let's get you some cheese
and-- oh, that's my hand you're peeing in, okay."

03:14:10.438 --> 03:14:12.060
TALIESIN: We always got bugs and cheese, man.

03:14:12.060 --> 03:14:15.470
MATT: He carries him off. All right, you gather
your supplies, you gather your cannonballs.

03:14:15.470 --> 03:14:17.602
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:14:17.602 --> 03:14:21.850
TRAVIS: On the count of three, when you're ready,
you'll lean backwards off the rail and fall into

03:14:21.850 --> 03:14:22.951
the water.

03:14:22.951 --> 03:14:24.802
LAURA: On the count of three, when you're ready.

03:14:24.802 --> 03:14:34.794
MATT: As it stands, the cannonballs are smooth,
solid metal. How are you bringing them down with you?

03:14:34.794 --> 03:14:36.050
TALIESIN: There's a couple of options here.

03:14:36.050 --> 03:14:37.412
LAURA: We're going to hold on to the sides.

03:14:37.412 --> 03:14:41.386
TALIESIN: Well, we want to be able to carry them
so if we have some small bags maybe?

03:14:41.386 --> 03:14:43.710
MARISHA: Like rope or chain? Oh! Yeah.

03:14:43.710 --> 03:14:45.517
TALIESIN: We can just put them in a bag that we
can hold.

03:14:45.517 --> 03:14:48.520
MATT: That can be done. You do have a few sacks.

03:14:48.520 --> 03:14:55.440
LIAM: They're iron, right? I would say that with
Nott piggybacking, Caleb would take his dagger and

03:14:55.440 --> 03:15:00.020
transmute it into iron to meld with the cannonball
and grip it that way.

03:15:00.020 --> 03:15:01.960
TRAVIS: Ooh, make a little handle.

03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:03.661
MATT: I'll allow it, yeah.

03:15:03.661 --> 03:15:05.312
LIAM: Thanks.

03:15:05.936 --> 03:15:09.491
MATT: As you place the dagger against it, there's
a brief moment where the dagger seems to shift

03:15:09.491 --> 03:15:13.694
energy and you slip it inside of it and at that
point, the handle is now solid with the

03:15:13.694 --> 03:15:18.262
cannonball, so one cannonball has a handle.
Another one, a sack around it. Actually, a few of

03:15:18.262 --> 03:15:20.107
them you can put sacks around it, so--

03:15:20.107 --> 03:15:22.061
TRAVIS: You want to share a cannonball, Jester?

03:15:22.061 --> 03:15:22.960
LAURA: Sure, Fjord.

03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:23.659
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:15:23.659 --> 03:15:29.981
MARISHA: Cad, you and me? What's Yasha doing, is
she coming with us or is she invigorated by the storm?

03:15:29.981 --> 03:15:31.578
TRAVIS: She gets her own cannonball because
she's--

03:15:31.578 --> 03:15:32.644
MATT: Yeah, she's coming with you.

03:15:32.644 --> 03:15:37.697
TRAVIS: Yeah, she's just like that. Just holding
it like a beast.

03:15:37.697 --> 03:15:38.879
LIAM: Palming it.

03:15:38.879 --> 03:15:41.362
MARISHA: Yeah. Globetrotters.

03:15:41.362 --> 03:15:45.462
TRAVIS: Ready? One, two, three.

03:15:45.462 --> 03:15:46.409
LAURA: Oh god!

03:15:46.409 --> 03:15:47.640
SAM: (screaming)

03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:59.821
MATT: You splash and break the surface of the
ocean. As you all begin to sink slowly beneath the

03:15:59.821 --> 03:16:05.586
waves, the light begins to get darker and darker
the further down you pass. The shades of

03:16:05.586 --> 03:16:13.966
green-blue begin to turn to a deep green-brown,
and even that light begins to fade, just having

03:16:13.966 --> 03:16:19.620
the few points of light that you are bringing
along with yourselves towards the bottom of the ocean.

03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:22.812
TRAVIS: I try to catch Nott. How is she doing?

03:16:22.812 --> 03:16:24.681
SAM: Eyes totally closed.

03:16:24.681 --> 03:16:26.703
TRAVIS: Are you breathing well? I give her a--

03:16:26.703 --> 03:16:28.542
MATT: Nott has not taken a breath yet, actually.

03:16:28.542 --> 03:16:30.491
TRAVIS: International sign for breathe.

03:16:30.491 --> 03:16:36.660
MATT: You get to a point, Nott, where your lungs
hurt so much you cannot help but breathe in, and

03:16:36.660 --> 03:16:40.379
there is a moment of panic as suddenly water
rushes into your lungs and the nightmare you've

03:16:40.379 --> 03:16:42.576
had many times kicks in.

03:16:42.576 --> 03:16:47.346
TRAVIS: Actually, that means go down.

03:16:47.346 --> 03:16:50.541
SAM: Shit.

03:16:57.136 --> 03:17:00.658
MATT: It takes a little bit to adjust and anxiety
is still spiked in you, but you begin to find

03:17:00.658 --> 03:17:06.004
yourself breathing water in and out-- like thicker
air, but still air-- and it's more comfortable

03:17:06.004 --> 03:17:08.176
than you expected.

03:17:08.176 --> 03:17:09.854
LAURA: Can we talk down here?

03:17:09.854 --> 03:17:10.900
MATT: You can.

03:17:10.900 --> 03:17:11.810
LAURA: We can?

03:17:11.810 --> 03:17:17.045
MATT: It doesn't have the same volume you do above
water, which means you can cast spells underwater

03:17:17.045 --> 03:17:17.898
without issue.

03:17:17.898 --> 03:17:18.474
LIAM: We can?

03:17:18.474 --> 03:17:26.430
MATT: Yes, same as you had before. It carries
vibration and sound travels far, but it loses

03:17:26.430 --> 03:17:32.582
enunciation at longer distances, but you can hear
voices longer.

03:17:32.582 --> 03:17:36.974
LIAM: There are four globules of light slowly
circling around.

03:17:36.974 --> 03:17:43.763
SAM: (gurgling) When we get back to the surface, I
will kill you.

03:17:43.763 --> 03:17:45.356
MARISHA: That was pretty good, though.

03:17:45.356 --> 03:17:47.858
MATT: Oh, this is going to be awful.

03:17:47.858 --> 03:17:52.677
TRAVIS: (gurgling) Well listen, Nott, as long as
we're down here--

03:17:52.677 --> 03:17:56.765
LIAM: Cannot do that joke anymore. That joke has
past.

03:17:58.902 --> 03:18:07.566
MATT: Your feet find the bottom of the ocean after
minutes. Ten minutes. Who knows how much time has

03:18:07.566 --> 03:18:11.583
past? It seemed longer than you expected until you
eventually you hit the bottom of the ocean.

03:18:11.583 --> 03:18:13.330
MARISHA: Look up. What do I see?

03:18:13.330 --> 03:18:19.118
MATT: You see the faint bit of light above where
it marks where the sunlight is hitting the waves,

03:18:19.118 --> 03:18:28.009
but it's an impossible distance from you from this
perspective. There are heavy, slowly shifting

03:18:28.009 --> 03:18:39.351
arms, waving tassels of kelp and sea vegetation
slightly drifting and moving with every faint bit

03:18:39.351 --> 03:18:45.801
of water that gets maneuvered through with each
wave and push as it goes, and you can feel it move

03:18:45.801 --> 03:18:51.295
you a few inches and you have to readjust as each
one pushes through.

03:18:53.165 --> 03:18:55.896
LAURA: It's like another world.

03:18:57.121 --> 03:19:01.008
MATT: You realize there shouldn't be waves this
deep necessarily.

03:19:01.008 --> 03:19:02.624
MARISHA: Where are they coming from?

03:19:02.624 --> 03:19:10.310
MATT: You glance over and watch as a large
creature is not that far away from you.

03:19:10.310 --> 03:19:12.577
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

03:19:12.577 --> 03:19:14.863
TALIESIN: I dim the light.

03:19:14.863 --> 03:19:18.066
LIAM: Can't see anymore.

03:19:18.066 --> 03:19:27.281
MATT: You hear a faint (whale singing) and glance
over the left. You can see a whale making its way

03:19:27.281 --> 03:19:31.101
through the water about 50, 60 feet from you.

03:19:31.101 --> 03:19:32.397
LIAM: I can't see shit.

03:19:32.397 --> 03:19:33.961
MATT: Not with a--

03:19:33.961 --> 03:19:36.008
MARISHA: I put my goggles on by the way--

03:19:36.008 --> 03:19:37.893
LIAM: You're good. I'm blind and are you blind?

03:19:37.893 --> 03:19:45.520
MATT: He still has the light. You can still see;
Caduceus and Yasha still have the light on their weapons.

03:19:45.520 --> 03:19:52.082
TALIESIN: My weapon glows but I did snuff it down.
I was waiting until we knew that we were okay. I

03:19:52.082 --> 03:19:54.035
move my light over to him.

03:19:54.035 --> 03:19:57.667
MATT: The whale continues on, slowly moving, not
really acknowledging your presence. You can see

03:19:57.667 --> 03:20:00.117
two other smaller whales alongside it.

03:20:00.117 --> 03:20:02.020
TRAVIS: Aww, baby calves.

03:20:02.020 --> 03:20:09.591
TALIESIN: Hey. Technically they can understand
me.

03:20:09.591 --> 03:20:16.769
MATT: Everyone make an investigation check. This
will be perception. Underwater, perception.

03:20:16.769 --> 03:20:18.288
SAM: Disadvantage!

03:20:18.288 --> 03:20:19.764
MATT: Yep.

03:20:19.764 --> 03:20:21.277
MARISHA: Natural one.

03:20:21.277 --> 03:20:22.987
TRAVIS: 19.

03:20:22.987 --> 03:20:24.065
LIAM: Nine.

03:20:24.065 --> 03:20:25.716
SAM: Four.

03:20:25.716 --> 03:20:26.822
LAURA: 14.

03:20:26.822 --> 03:20:27.949
TALIESIN: At disadvantage?

03:20:27.949 --> 03:20:28.808
SAM: No. Just me.

03:20:28.808 --> 03:20:29.912
TALIESIN: Oh, 16.

03:20:29.912 --> 03:20:31.589
MATT: Roll for Yasha as well.

03:20:32.726 --> 03:20:35.558
TRAVIS: Five for her.

03:20:35.558 --> 03:20:43.276
MATT: Oof. All right, overall party: not so great.
It takes you a little while, about two to three

03:20:43.276 --> 03:20:48.678
hours of searching the bottom of the ocean. You're
starting to get a little hungry again from all the

03:20:48.678 --> 03:20:55.232
strenuous activity of moving and dragging these
cannonballs with you to keep you weighted down so

03:20:55.232 --> 03:21:00.601
you can step across the surface. You come past
some deep sea corals and beautiful colorful

03:21:00.601 --> 03:21:06.305
visions and schools of fish scooting and coasting
around. At one point, they swarm past you, and you

03:21:06.305 --> 03:21:13.592
feel them tickling past your torso before they
skitter past. Eventually, this lift begins to

03:21:13.592 --> 03:21:22.080
descend into a small bowl or at least a point
where the shelf begins to head in a downward

03:21:22.080 --> 03:21:30.062
direction at a decline. Within the next 15 or so
minutes of traveling in that direction, you see

03:21:30.062 --> 03:21:36.430
the outline of a familiar ship.

03:21:36.430 --> 03:21:41.102
TRAVIS: I push forward towards it. Point and start
to swim.

03:21:41.102 --> 03:21:47.428
MATT: All right. As you all gather in behind Fjord
making your way in the direction of this long

03:21:47.428 --> 03:21:49.976
forgotten shipwreck, we'll pick it up there next
week.

03:21:49.976 --> 03:21:52.709
(groaning)

03:21:54.382 --> 03:21:56.434
MATT: You'll find out next week!

03:21:56.434 --> 03:21:57.546
SAM: Oh my god, Matt.

03:21:57.546 --> 03:21:59.668
MARISHA and TRAVIS: What a game!

03:21:59.668 --> 03:22:01.042
MATT: That was a good session, guys.

03:22:01.042 --> 03:22:08.008
LIAM: One of the best ever. So many great games!

03:22:08.008 --> 03:22:15.055
MATT: That went some interesting places. There's a
number of scenarios that didn't happen.

03:22:15.055 --> 03:22:18.702
TRAVIS: There was a number of scenarios that
didn't happen?

03:22:18.702 --> 03:22:21.923
SAM: I feel like there was so much more on the
island that we did not--

03:22:21.923 --> 03:22:23.402
MATT: There's a lot more on that island.

03:22:23.402 --> 03:22:28.303
SAM: There's Allison, there was shit alleys, and
there was all kinds of fun stuff.

03:22:28.303 --> 03:22:31.932
TALIESIN: Just because we're banished doesn't mean
we're never going back.

03:22:31.932 --> 03:22:34.487
MARISHA: We keep pissing off the towns.

03:22:34.487 --> 03:22:39.192
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so sorry. Like a cop said
"you're trespassing" and now we're just going to

03:22:39.192 --> 03:22:40.757
never trespass again?

03:22:40.757 --> 03:22:41.640
TRAVIS: Well said.

03:22:41.640 --> 03:22:44.891
MATT: Yes, we're not because we're law abiding
citizens.

03:22:44.891 --> 03:22:49.142
MARISHA: I was going to say, when you go into a
convenience store and it's got the "Have you seen

03:22:49.142 --> 03:22:50.706
"this person?"

03:22:50.706 --> 03:22:52.935
LIAM: This campaign is a social experiment.

03:22:52.935 --> 03:22:59.280
MATT: Oh yeah. This has gone really interesting,
fun places. Well, thank you guys. I'm excited to

03:22:59.280 --> 03:23:08.567
pick this up next week at the shipwreck. Thank you
guys for tuning in. Yeah, I missed this-- two

03:23:08.567 --> 03:23:10.889
weeks off and suddenly--

03:23:10.889 --> 03:23:12.330
LIAM: All the dead.

03:23:12.330 --> 03:23:14.267
TALIESIN: We were freaking out all for two weeks
straight.

03:23:14.267 --> 03:23:15.208
LAURA: Yeah.

03:23:15.208 --> 03:23:17.314
MATT: You guys had some good, solid plans.

03:23:17.314 --> 03:23:19.869
MARISHA: Our plan was okay.

03:23:19.869 --> 03:23:20.790
MATT: Yeah.

03:23:20.790 --> 03:23:25.311
TALIESIN: That was entirely worth the amount of
data it took up on my phone.

03:23:25.311 --> 03:23:26.974
LIAM: It worked.

03:23:26.974 --> 03:23:30.504
TRAVIS: I think all anyone asked is for some
slight improvements in our planning over the

03:23:30.504 --> 03:23:32.229
years. Slight improvements.

03:23:32.229 --> 03:23:33.861
LIAM: Yeah, it worked.

03:23:33.861 --> 03:23:38.953
MATT: Man, most of D&amp;amp;D is about plans that go
fucking tits up the minute you try and talk about

03:23:38.953 --> 03:23:45.771
it. Everyone is like, "Oh, they planned so
terribly." Every D&amp;amp;D game, everyone plans

03:23:45.771 --> 03:23:50.679
terribly. Sometimes plans go great, and those are
the ones you remember when you compare it to other

03:23:50.679 --> 03:23:55.317
people. "Oh, we're great planners. Remember that
two times over the past 18 years we played where

03:23:55.317 --> 03:24:00.269
"our plans went great? Those are the times we'll
always bring up and judging other people's plans."

03:24:00.269 --> 03:24:04.128
Yeah, everyone has some good plans every now and
then. More often than not, plans go pretty shitty

03:24:04.128 --> 03:24:11.178
and that's fun. Anyway, thank you all for coming
and watching along with us after the two week

03:24:11.178 --> 03:24:18.737
break. Thank you D&amp;amp;D Beyond for being our amazing
friends and sponsors. We'll see you in a week and

03:24:18.737 --> 03:24:21.226
remember we love you all--

03:24:21.226 --> 03:24:26.909
LIAM: (creepy voice) Is it Thursday yet?
(growling)

03:24:26.909 --> 03:24:28.682
MARISHA: You did this.

03:24:28.682 --> 03:24:30.524
SAM: Yeah, I did.

03:24:30.524 --> 03:24:31.629
MARISHA: This is you.

03:24:31.629 --> 03:24:32.970
SAM: Sorry.

03:24:32.970 --> 03:24:36.169
LIAM: I'm so upset. (normal voice) Take it away,
Matt.

03:24:36.169 --> 03:24:39.208
MATT: Is it Thursday yet? Good night, everybody.

03:24:39.208 --> 03:24:42.464
(laughter)

03:24:42.464 --> 03:24:49.996

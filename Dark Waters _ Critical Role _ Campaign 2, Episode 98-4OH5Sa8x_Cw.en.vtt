00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.251
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:03.084
of Critical Role,

3
00:00:03.084 --> 00:00:04.360
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.100
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.235
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:11.045
MATT: Just like that.

7
00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:12.887
Before we get into tonight's session,

8
00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:14.268
we have a few announcements to get through,

9
00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:16.220
beginning with our fantastic sponsor for tonight,

10
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.610
our friends since the beginning of Campaign Two,

11
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.685
D&amp;D Beyond.

12
00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.400
Sam.
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

13
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.807
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond!

14
00:00:22.807 --> 00:00:24.490
Thanks to D&amp;D Beyond for continuing

15
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.488
to support the show.

16
00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:30.097
The Wildemount Campaign Guide is only a few short weeks away

17
00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.417
from being released.

/criticalrole.

22
00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.867
To celebrate this amazing literary achievement,

23
00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:48.198
I'm going to present to you a musical spectacle tonight

24
00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:50.650
that you've never seen before.

25
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.383
We have-- D&amp;D Beyond has a theme song

26
00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:57.188
that I, Sam Riegel, wrote, recorded, and vocalized.

27
00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:01.367
But Ashley Johnson is such a beloved fan of the song,

28
00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:04.065
that she does not know how the melody goes.

29
00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:06.841
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's crazy how much I've listened to it

30
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.563
and know it so well.

31
00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:11.737
SAM: So tonight, I proudly present,

32
00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.606
Ashley Johnson singing

33
00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:17.530
the D&amp;D Beyond theme song a capella.

34
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.943
ASHLEY: A capella?!

35
00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:20.710
SAM: Yeah, a capella.

36
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.186
Without having listened to it ahead of time.

37
00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:24.522
TRAVIS: Yep, the immediate reaction.

38
00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:25.355
MARISHA: Yeah!

39
00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:27.750
SAM: She's got the lyrics.

40
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.115
She can use them if she needs them,

41
00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:31.200
but I know she's such a huge fan of the show

42
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.958
and the song she won't need them.

43
00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.808
Take it away, Ashley.

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:32.570
It was a pitch perfect performance.

74
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.982
ASHLEY: Yeah, thank you so much.
SAM: So good, thank you.

75
00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:36.823
LIAM: The cutest thing that ever happened.
ASHLEY: I know it well.

76
00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.656

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.520
SAM: Oh, thank you, Ashley.

78
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.790
Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

79
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.623
Matt, back to you.

80
00:02:41.623 --> 00:02:43.908
ASHLEY: I can't wait to listen to that song.

81
00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:45.120
MATT: It's going up on Spotify next week.

82
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.187
SAM: Can someone can throw some instruments under it?

83
00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:48.757
MATT: Yeah.

84
00:02:48.757 --> 00:02:50.302
Yeah, one of you Critters out there,

85
00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:51.885
mix your own version of Ashley Johnson's D&amp;D Beyond.

86
00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:53.977
ASHLEY: No, don't you do it.

87
00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:57.270
We don't need it.
TRAVIS: No, no.

88
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.727
MATT: If I have to suffer through Sam's shirts every week.

89
00:02:59.727 --> 00:03:03.482
ASHLEY: Fair enough.
MATT: I'm dragging you with me.

90
00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:05.668
Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for your fantastic support.

91
00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:08.848
And super excited for the Wildemount Campaign Guide,

92
00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:11.868
The Explorer's Guide to Wildemount comes out in,
like, less than two weeks.

93
00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:14.120
That's insane.

94
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.724
So excited for you guys to check it out.

95
00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:19.035
It's a lot of hard work from
a lot of great people and myself.

96
00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:20.360
I'm really proud of it.

97
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.852
And hope you guys enjoy it.

98
00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:23.203
So if you haven't pre-ordered it yet,

99
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.193
you can still, or buy it when it comes out

100
00:03:25.193 --> 00:03:27.793
at your friendly local game store.

101
00:03:28.827 --> 00:03:30.824
Couple other announcements.

102
00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:31.657
(laughs)

103
00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:33.245
There you go.
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

104
00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.057
MATT: Big thanks to all the fantastic Critters

105
00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:36.776
that came out to C2E2.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

106
00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:39.683
MATT: As well as our live show last Thursday.

107
00:03:39.683 --> 00:03:41.997
Thank you for your patience,

108
00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:45.313
as there were issues with the ticketing system

109
00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:47.002
and other things that ended up causing this huge delay.

110
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:48.450
So thank you so much for your patience

111
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.752
in very, very harsh weather. That sucked.

112
00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:54.638
And we are so glad that you guys made it

113
00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:56.557
and it was a great show.

114
00:03:56.557 --> 00:03:57.390
Thank you for attending it,

115
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.001
and thank you guys for watching it.

116
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:01.442
TRAVIS: The energy was so good.
MATT: I know.

117
00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:03.160
LAURA: It was so much fun.

118
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.420
MATT: I do want to say, though,
our hearts, here at Critical Role,

119
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.411
do go out to everyone in Nashville who've suffered

120
00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:12.668
and been devastated by these tornadoes recently.

121
00:04:12.668 --> 00:04:15.082
If you're able to, please consider donating

122
00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:18.792
to any of the reputable nonprofit organizations

123
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:20.090
that are working to help provide aid

124
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.870
for the people in need

125
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.328
and provide assistance in those areas.

126
00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:27.155
We like the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee,

127
00:04:27.155 --> 00:04:29.096
so you can make a donation, if you'd like to there,

128
00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:32.112
at cfmt.org.

129
00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:34.860
But do your research and find the right folks to donate to.

130
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.887
But thank you for helping out.

131
00:04:37.887 --> 00:04:39.322
Laura, you have an announcement.

132
00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:40.580
LAURA: I do!

133
00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:43.708
SAM: Balls, balls, balls.

134
00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:45.648
LAURA: No, there's a couple good ones in here.

135
00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:48.522
There's my announcement. Um, no.

136
00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:53.458
You guys might have noticed, in the store, right now.

137
00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:55.905
We got some shirts available.

138
00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:58.250
We got-- okay, wait, hold on.

139
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.452
TALIESIN: I'm waiting. I'm not going to do anything.
LAURA: The US one first.

140
00:05:00.452 --> 00:05:03.199
This is by Bryan Weiss. He's done our other shirts for us.

141
00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.650
(cheering)

142
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.533
This is in Zemnian and in Common!

143
00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:09.197
What does it say, Caleb?

144
00:05:09.197 --> 00:05:10.574
LIAM: Well, it says--

145
00:05:10.574 --> 00:05:11.417
woo-szuh bah!

146
00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.304
MARISHA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Oh!

147
00:05:13.304 --> 00:05:16.070
LIAM: <i>Zuhause liegt im Herzen.</i>

148
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.610
Which is a close approximation

149
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.236
of "home is where the heart is."

150
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.313
(awwing)

151
00:05:21.313 --> 00:05:22.346
LAURA: Yeah, so this was--
LIAM: On fire.

152
00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:24.071
LAURA: -- conceptualized by Liam O'Brien,

153
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.125
which is pretty freaking cool.

154
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:29.933
And then for our special UK shoppers,

155
00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:32.523
we've got another one.

156
00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:35.457
It's the same shirt, but it's-- it's different color.

157
00:05:35.457 --> 00:05:37.519
ALL: (oohing and aahing)

158
00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.042
SAM: It looks British.

159
00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:40.558
LAURA: Doesn't it?

160
00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:41.863
This one's got an accent.

161
00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:44.079
MATT: Like it has history.
SAM: Uh-huh. Yep.

162
00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:46.195
It's a little bit smarter than the other one.

163
00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:47.028
MARISHA: Yeah.

164
00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:48.655
LAURA: Those are our shirts and that are available.

165
00:05:48.655 --> 00:05:51.270
We also have, which something I've been wanting to have

166
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.811
for a very long time,

167
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.728
are some stickers.
SAM: We got stickers!

168
00:05:54.728 --> 00:05:56.754
LAURA: We got vinyl stickers by Jenny Park.

169
00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:58.481
They're the same-- oh!

170
00:05:58.481 --> 00:06:01.269
(laughter)

171
00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:03.473
I'm opening them, so this are mine now.

172
00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:05.097
So we got our Mighty Nein logo,

173
00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:07.575
and we got all of the chibi people!

174
00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.590
(cheering)

175
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.990
SAM: What can you stick them on, Laura?

176
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.395
LAURA: You can stick them on anything!

177
00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:13.778
ASHLEY: Could I stick it on my water bottle?

178
00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:15.521
LAURA: You could definitely stick it on your water bottle.

179
00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:18.254
SAM: Right now?
LAURA: Sure.

180
00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:19.762
They're vinyl.

181
00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:22.748
(laughter)

182
00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:24.610
TALIESIN: I'm going to die.
SAM: That's the slogan.

183
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.042
TALIESIN: "They're vinyl!"

184
00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:27.708
TRAVIS: Ding!

185
00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:30.458
LAURA: So yeah. Go look at store.

186
00:06:31.374 --> 00:06:32.207
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

187
00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:33.624
LAURA: You're welcome.

188
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.273
MATT: All righty.
LAURA: Oh, that's so cute!

189
00:06:37.273 --> 00:06:38.348
TRAVIS: Which one'd you pick?

190
00:06:38.348 --> 00:06:40.449
TALIESIN: Clay.
SAM: Aww.

191
00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.906
LAURA: Aw, I was going to pick my own character.
MATT: It's going to be a shame when I kill him.

192
00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:44.739
SAM: No, no that's--

193
00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:46.224
TRAVIS: What'd you say?!
MATT: I didn't say anything.

194
00:06:46.224 --> 00:06:47.730
TALIESIN: No.

195
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.960
Ah!

196
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.160
MATT: Anyway, I believe that's the end of our announcements.

197
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.160
So let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of

198
00:06:57.228 --> 00:06:58.281
Critical Role.

199
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:01.039

MATT: Wow.

235
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.569
TALIESIN: Been holding onto that for a while.

236
00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:42.309
MATT: Welcome back.

237
00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.491
So last we left off.

238
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.416
The Mighty Nein had returned to Nicodranas

239
00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:49.457
to prepare their travel

240
00:08:49.457 --> 00:08:51.788
towards the negotiation between the Kryn Dynasty

241
00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.656
and Dwendalian Empire.

242
00:08:53.656 --> 00:08:56.059
Upon arriving and settling yourselves,

243
00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:00.085
you, one, discovered that on one of the vessels which

244
00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:05.085
was built by and belongs to the Cerberus Assembly,

245
00:09:05.098 --> 00:09:07.351
that a few members were present,

246
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.214
as well as a new figure that you had not encountered before.

247
00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:13.602
After a bit of monkey espionage,

248
00:09:13.602 --> 00:09:16.504
you revealed this individual to be

249
00:09:16.504 --> 00:09:18.912
Essek in disguise,

250
00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:21.054
who revealed to have some connection

251
00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:23.223
with the Cerberus Assembly.

252
00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:25.647
As the intrigue continued to spread,

253
00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:28.272
you completed

254
00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:30.939
the transmogrification spell on Nott,

255
00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:35.939
with the curse lifted and restored Veth Brenatto

256
00:09:36.445 --> 00:09:38.945
as she was always meant to be.

257
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.868
After a bit of shopping, you also were invited to a party

258
00:09:43.868 --> 00:09:48.072
at the local Marquis' estate.

259
00:09:48.072 --> 00:09:51.595
And upon attending, you convinced Marion Lavorre

260
00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.611
to go and perform.

261
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:54.778
Through series of spells,

262
00:09:54.778 --> 00:09:58.527
Beau had a very interesting altered experience.

263
00:09:59.835 --> 00:10:02.397
Some fancy dress that was purchased

264
00:10:02.397 --> 00:10:05.537
and designed by Caduceus and Jester.

265
00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:07.113
LAURA: Yay!

266
00:10:07.113 --> 00:10:10.722
MATT: And upon realizing that Essek,
within the illusory form,

267
00:10:10.722 --> 00:10:13.815
was attempting to escape when pressured at the party.

268
00:10:13.815 --> 00:10:15.539
You managed to subdue him

269
00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:17.738
and escort him to your ship at the docks.

270
00:10:17.738 --> 00:10:22.160
There, an interrogation led you to some revelations,

271
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.619
some emotions, and where we left off

272
00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:31.296
a bit of a climactic conversation

273
00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:32.930
continues.

274
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.162
So as now all of you there, dressed to the nines,

275
00:10:37.162 --> 00:10:41.003
in the shadowed gun deck of--
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Neins!

276
00:10:41.003 --> 00:10:43.480
(laughter)

277
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.237
MATT: -- gun deck of Balleater,

278
00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:48.868
Essek sits upon the crate

279
00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:51.134
as you all surround an inquiry.

280
00:10:51.134 --> 00:10:55.413
You had just made an invitation to The Mighty Nein,

281
00:10:55.413 --> 00:10:57.413
to Essek as a thank you.

282
00:10:58.268 --> 00:11:00.598
Essek, at this point, looks up to you,

283
00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:02.170
Veth, and kind of,

284
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.645
"(chuckles) (sighs)"

285
00:11:07.637 --> 00:11:10.678
SAM: Oh, also, I'm the goblin from before.

286
00:11:11.918 --> 00:11:13.255
MATT: "Right! No--

287
00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:18.046
"I didn't-- I assume that it worked, then, yes?"

288
00:11:18.046 --> 00:11:22.250
LIAM: Yeah, we removed the impediment

289
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.658
that we discussed with you, yeah.
MATT: "I gathered."

290
00:11:23.658 --> 00:11:26.325
LAURA: Yeah, we broke my mom's tub doing-- (gasps)

291
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.178
Mama!

292
00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:31.332
I got to go, I got to go, I got to go!

293
00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:32.727
I run out of the room.

294
00:11:32.727 --> 00:11:34.612
MATT: Okay.

295
00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:36.168
"Very well, it is--"

296
00:11:36.168 --> 00:11:38.327
TRAVIS: I'll go, I'll chase after her.

297
00:11:38.327 --> 00:11:40.098
MATT: "All right."

298
00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:41.983
TALIESIN: Is this is the thing we're doing, or--?

299
00:11:41.983 --> 00:11:44.011
SAM: No, no, no. This is important; we should stay here.

300
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:44.844
TALIESIN: Okay.

301
00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:48.811
MATT: "I appreciate what you're saying,

302
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.660
"and I'm thankful that you have a modicum of faith in me,

303
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.960
"undeserving as that might be.

304
00:11:56.901 --> 00:11:57.734
"Um.

305
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.345
"It is in that interest

306
00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:04.172
"that I just want to warn you about getting too close.

307
00:12:04.172 --> 00:12:05.588
"I'm tied,

308
00:12:06.837 --> 00:12:09.587
"to a lot of dangerous individuals

309
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.102
"and teeter in the shadows at the crux

310
00:12:13.102 --> 00:12:16.176
"of all of this conflict

311
00:12:16.176 --> 00:12:19.403
"intentional as it may not have been.

312
00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:24.595
"I would never want to put you in a situation,

313
00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:25.987
"or put myself in a situation

314
00:12:25.987 --> 00:12:29.180
"where I would have to choose between myself

315
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.564
"and the rest of you."

316
00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:36.862
LIAM: Why don't you talk us through

317
00:12:38.218 --> 00:12:40.551
the next few days and weeks?

318
00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:43.425
MATT: "Well,

319
00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:46.410
"they currently exist

320
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.113
"in a delicate balance with the Cerberus Assembly,

321
00:12:50.113 --> 00:12:54.020
"for either could reveal this charade,

322
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.877
"to the detriment of the other.

323
00:12:55.877 --> 00:12:57.660
"There is respect, at least, I believe

324
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.110
"on an intellectual level.

325
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.793
"But I am but one working across from many.

326
00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:08.102
"I think my utility with the Assembly,

327
00:13:08.102 --> 00:13:09.617
"continuing to cover up with this endeavor

328
00:13:09.617 --> 00:13:11.383
"from the inside of the Dynasty,

329
00:13:11.383 --> 00:13:15.810
"as well as my insights into their dunamantic interests,

330
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.301
"make me too valuable at the moment to be

331
00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:22.192
"buried.

332
00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:25.312
"But doesn't mean that I can stop being paranoid,

333
00:13:27.368 --> 00:13:30.140
"nor can I assume that my presence to you

334
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.350
"doesn't put you in continuous danger, either.

335
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.183
"So,

336
00:13:37.708 --> 00:13:39.724
"in time, I hope this will pass.

337
00:13:41.058 --> 00:13:42.858
"But for now, we will--

338
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.165
"I will continue to escort

339
00:13:47.165 --> 00:13:49.781
"a handful of Assembly members

340
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:52.950
"to this negotiation,

341
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.242
"and if you are indeed coming with your ship as well,

342
00:13:56.242 --> 00:13:58.165
"we will be nearby.

343
00:13:58.165 --> 00:14:00.965
"We'll oversee the

"transference of the beacon to the Dynasty,

345

"as well as the trade of the prisoners.

"Some discussions and agreements will hopefully come to bear

347
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.432

"the public conflict to an end.

"After which,

"and we continue as if none of this had happened.

SAM: Well,

355
00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:46.191
it's hard to hard to forecast out

356
00:14:46.191 --> 00:14:48.092
past the next few days.

357
00:14:49.078 --> 00:14:54.078
But, I mean, let's not kid ourselves, that at some point

358
00:14:54.078 --> 00:14:57.320
someone is going to have to pay

359
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.003
for some of the damage that has been done.

360
00:15:02.677 --> 00:15:05.537
MATT: "I admire your sense of heroism,

361
00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:08.648
"but history is full of people

362
00:15:08.648 --> 00:15:12.187
"who have not paid for their sins."

363
00:15:12.187 --> 00:15:14.810
MARISHA: Full of a lot of people who have.

364
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.393
MATT: "Some."
TALIESIN: Or some who've paid for others.

365
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.127
SAM: And while we feel a kinship towards you,

366
00:15:23.127 --> 00:15:25.223
and apparently you towards us,

367
00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:28.700
unless you're lying about that,

368
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.002
there's nothing necessarily stopping us

369
00:15:32.002 --> 00:15:36.169
from enacting justice on other folks

370
00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:40.113
who have been involved in this scheme.

371
00:15:40.113 --> 00:15:41.754
MATT: "I am not going to get in the way

372
00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:46.754
"of any perceived vengeances.

373
00:15:47.343 --> 00:15:49.630
"Just know that,

374
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.537
"it is safest that I not involve myself in particular

375
00:15:52.537 --> 00:15:53.803
"with such endeavors."
SAM: Of course.

376
00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:56.990
It might help us, though, if we knew

377
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.977
if there were any members of the Cerberus Assembly

378
00:15:59.977 --> 00:16:04.977
or anyone that you are particularly beholden to

379
00:16:04.977 --> 00:16:08.505
or allied with, that we should

380
00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:12.414
steer clear of, or be especially mindful of.

381
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.971
MATT: "The Martinet is extremely intelligent

382
00:16:17.971 --> 00:16:20.198
"and very resourceful.

383
00:16:20.198 --> 00:16:22.457
"So the less,

00:16:22.457 --> 00:16:26.573
"that can be revealed to him

"clever in her own way.

388
00:16:37.585 --> 00:16:42.210
"And I am curious to what her involvement

389
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.772
"is to the Biting North, in particular.

390
00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:50.446
"That may or may not be involved in this, but

391
00:16:50.446 --> 00:16:52.697
"I trust her less than most, I think."

392
00:16:54.032 --> 00:16:57.112
LIAM: Are you prepared for all of this
to go sideways on you?

393
00:16:57.112 --> 00:16:58.483
MATT: "Always.

394
00:16:58.483 --> 00:17:00.292
"I have been the three years

395
00:17:00.292 --> 00:17:03.533
"since we began this plot."

396
00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:13.105
LIAM: I feel conflicted about this,

397
00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:18.105
but would like to see even a temporary end to conflict.

398
00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:21.760
MATT: "Well, outwardly."

399
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.313
MARISHA: Why do you keep saying that?
What does that mean?

400
00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:29.768
MATT: "I would hope that in your
studies within the Cobalt Soul,

401
00:17:29.768 --> 00:17:33.527
"you understand that conflict is perpetual."

402
00:17:33.527 --> 00:17:34.577
MARISHA: I do.

403
00:17:34.577 --> 00:17:37.165
I'm just curious what your brand is.

404
00:17:37.165 --> 00:17:40.603
LIAM: Well, he has acknowledged that they are keeping

405
00:17:40.603 --> 00:17:43.507
one of these artifacts in the Empire,

406
00:17:43.507 --> 00:17:47.257
and they're not doing it for posterity's sake.

407
00:17:48.197 --> 00:17:50.598
MATT: "I mean, there has been a
shadow war between the Dynasty

408
00:17:50.598 --> 00:17:52.640
"and the Empire for decades.

409
00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:57.653
"This is just the first time that it's brimmed out,

410
00:17:57.653 --> 00:18:00.287
"of the control of those that waged it."

411
00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:05.287
TALIESIN: And when the Dynasty finds out
that there's another artifact--

412
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.557
MATT: "They <i>cannot</i>."

413
00:18:07.557 --> 00:18:09.040
TALIESIN: <i>When</i> they find out.

414
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.075
MATT: "Then let's hope we are far away

415
00:18:13.075 --> 00:18:15.850
"and well protected when it happens."

416
00:18:17.107 --> 00:18:18.738
TALIESIN: Let's hope it takes a very long time,

417
00:18:18.738 --> 00:18:22.385
or that it make its way home without anyone

418
00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:24.993
ever having to admit it was gone in the first place.

419
00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:32.574
LIAM: Doesn't seem like you have a choice here.

420
00:18:32.574 --> 00:18:36.200
You seem fairly well painted into a corner.

421
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.783
MATT: "So it would seem.

422
00:18:38.697 --> 00:18:43.388
"But I've gotten this far by

423
00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:45.096
"leaning into my resources.

424
00:18:49.023 --> 00:18:51.356
"I know I can protect myself.

425
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.348
"I don't think I can protect all of you.

426
00:18:56.348 --> 00:18:59.374
"And that is why I'm worried."

427
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.419
LIAM: Well, I would just hope

428
00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:07.037
that if things go pear-shaped on us,

429
00:19:07.037 --> 00:19:11.695
counter to how you hope and believe things will go,

430
00:19:11.695 --> 00:19:15.470
if your life is in danger and our lives as well,

431
00:19:17.745 --> 00:19:22.410
that you are willing to work with your friends,

432
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.977
to survive it.

433
00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:27.807
MATT: "To survive it, yes."

434
00:19:30.093 --> 00:19:31.593
LIAM: Make no mistake.

435
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.737
We do not trust you.

436
00:19:37.398 --> 00:19:38.231
MATT: "Good.

437
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.550
"That'll help you survive."

438
00:19:43.657 --> 00:19:45.832
LIAM: Doesn't mean we don't hope for you.

439
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.937
It's a tricky balance, Essek.

440
00:19:52.053 --> 00:19:53.636
MATT: "Isn't everything?

441
00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:58.400
"(sighs)

442
00:20:00.597 --> 00:20:04.614
"Even if this is successful,

443
00:20:04.614 --> 00:20:07.930
"and the war is declared over,

444
00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:13.552
"that doesn't mean everything goes back to normal.

00:20:13.552 --> 00:20:18.135
"The tangled espionage between both sides of this

446
00:20:19.072 --> 00:20:23.482
"has gone on for long and will continue to go.

447
00:20:23.482 --> 00:20:27.657
"The Augen Trust is deeply ingrained, as is the Lens.

448
00:20:29.533 --> 00:20:33.450
"We just have to be careful who we tell anything to.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.175
"My recommendation is nothing to anyone."

450
00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:42.433
SAM: Well, if there's anything that we are adept at,

451
00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:45.002
it's being careful

452
00:20:45.002 --> 00:20:49.135
and keeping information close to the vest.

453
00:20:50.859 --> 00:20:54.255
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

454
00:20:54.255 --> 00:20:57.390
Oh.
MATT: "We are in so much trouble."

455
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.518
TALIESIN: That was serious.

456
00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:00.359
LIAM: And there's no one else,

457
00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:03.437
no one else has your ear in this way?

458
00:21:03.437 --> 00:21:05.287
MATT: "No."
LIAM: No.

459
00:21:07.902 --> 00:21:10.440
TALIESIN: Please try and keep us informed.

460
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440
MATT: "Of course.

461
00:21:12.278 --> 00:21:13.815
"To the best of my ability."

462
00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:14.815
TALIESIN: Of course.

463
00:21:18.553 --> 00:21:21.687
MATT: "Once again, for whatever it's worth, I am sorry."

464
00:21:23.428 --> 00:21:26.193
TALIESIN: Apology accepted, at least from here.

465
00:21:26.193 --> 00:21:27.542
MARISHA: He doesn't speak for all of us.

466
00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:29.183
TALIESIN: I definitely do not.

467
00:21:30.877 --> 00:21:32.718
MARISHA: Why don't you get some rest, Essek?

468
00:21:34.768 --> 00:21:36.268
MATT: "You do the same.

469
00:21:37.771 --> 00:21:41.304
"The night is still young. I would hate for you to

470
00:21:41.304 --> 00:21:45.263
"waste such a polished presentation."

471
00:21:46.577 --> 00:21:48.895
He sits up off his crate and,

472
00:21:48.895 --> 00:21:53.336
glides back to his faint hover.

473
00:21:58.557 --> 00:21:59.640
"Good night."

474
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.081
His illusion once more transitions

475
00:22:04.081 --> 00:22:05.724
to the blond elven figure

476
00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.478
that he's been masquerading as since his arrival

477
00:22:07.478 --> 00:22:10.007
in Nicodranas.

478
00:22:10.007 --> 00:22:15.007
He waits tensely to make sure that

479
00:22:15.058 --> 00:22:16.724
he can leave.

480
00:22:17.778 --> 00:22:21.437
LIAM: If you truly hope for a second chance, truly,

481
00:22:23.293 --> 00:22:25.426
step very carefully with us.

482
00:22:25.426 --> 00:22:26.509
SAM: Glide.

483
00:22:33.236 --> 00:22:35.528
MATT: Then he just leaves.

484
00:22:39.563 --> 00:22:43.152
SAM: Well, that's a pickle.

485
00:22:43.152 --> 00:22:44.627
MARISHA: What the fuck.

486
00:22:46.097 --> 00:22:46.930
TALIESIN: Is it?

487
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.790
MATT: Make a history check.

488
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.114
MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

489
00:22:53.219 --> 00:22:57.342
LAURA and MARISHA: Eh-ooh-ahh.

490
00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:58.685
MARISHA: 23.

491
00:22:58.685 --> 00:22:59.518
MATT: Okay.

492
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.820
You did hear him mention the Augen Trust and the Lens.

493
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.010
SAM: He said the Lens. What is that?

494
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.960
MARISHA: Did you say the Og--?

495
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.358
MATT: The Augen Trust.

496
00:23:09.358 --> 00:23:14.298
Which you know is-- from-- because there's been a lot of--

497
00:23:14.298 --> 00:23:17.065
they're competitive force with the Cobalt Soul

498
00:23:17.065 --> 00:23:20.540
in the sense they are the crown's spy network.

499
00:23:22.642 --> 00:23:24.223
TRAVIS: Augen Trust.

500
00:23:24.223 --> 00:23:25.631
MARISHA: On the Dy-- on the--

501
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:27.378
MATT and MARISHA: On the Empire side.

502
00:23:27.378 --> 00:23:28.982
MATT: And it's often that the Cobalt Soul

503
00:23:28.982 --> 00:23:30.755
and Augen Trust butt the heads

504
00:23:30.755 --> 00:23:32.780
and sometimes find themselves in similar spaces

505
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.707
going for similar information for different reasons.

506
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:40.707
And are very competitive and tense about

507
00:23:40.872 --> 00:23:44.397
achieving their own unique means.

508
00:23:44.397 --> 00:23:47.225
SAM: So the Cobalt Soul is an independent organization?

509
00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:48.058
TALIESIN: Yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

510
00:23:48.058 --> 00:23:48.991
TRAVIS: Not affiliated with any--

511
00:23:48.991 --> 00:23:52.617
SAM: Wow, I thought it was, like, loosely Empire.

512
00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:56.902
MATT: In the sense that it's
an approved religious institution

513
00:23:56.902 --> 00:24:01.268
within the Empire that works alongside, in some ways,

514
00:24:01.268 --> 00:24:04.720
but is very much-- presents itself as a subtle

515
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.770
check and balance to the Empire and the Empire does not

516
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.667
necessarily appreciate that,
and there's pushback on both sides

517
00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:12.252
in this really strange in-between space.

518
00:24:12.252 --> 00:24:13.805
TALIESIN: They're international, too, as well, the Cobalt.

519
00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:15.221
MATT: Correct.

520
00:24:16.367 --> 00:24:17.367
MARISHA: And the Lens?

521
00:24:17.367 --> 00:24:19.175
MATT: The Lens is the

522
00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:23.240
Bright Queen's spy network in the Dynasty.

523
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.990
TALIESIN: That's a good name.

524
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.492
MATT: And so, his talk of shadow wars and espionage.

525
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.022
In your mind, you immediately begin to put together that

526
00:24:36.022 --> 00:24:37.745
this is--

527
00:24:37.745 --> 00:24:38.583
MARISHA: What he was talking about.

528
00:24:38.583 --> 00:24:40.830
MATT: Yeah, this is what he was referring to.

529
00:24:43.238 --> 00:24:44.818
MARISHA: Cold War all the time.

530
00:24:44.818 --> 00:24:47.085
MATT: At least in recent times.

531
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.077
MARISHA: Interesting.

532
00:24:51.749 --> 00:24:52.582
Okay.

533
00:24:56.435 --> 00:25:00.956
LIAM: Well, nothing changes if everybody's on the up and up.

534
00:25:00.956 --> 00:25:03.023
TALIESIN: I think, if anything, this

535
00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:08.015
illuminates a bunch of mysteries pretty thoroughly.

536
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.122
It's, on a certain level, the best this

537
00:25:13.122 --> 00:25:15.853
could have possibly worked out.

538
00:25:15.853 --> 00:25:18.442
We now know why they have had two,

539
00:25:18.442 --> 00:25:21.113
we now know what they were hiding.

540
00:25:21.113 --> 00:25:21.946
This is--

541
00:25:23.298 --> 00:25:25.419
This feels helpful.

542
00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:27.460
LIAM: Well, it's a moment in time.

543
00:25:28.635 --> 00:25:31.350
The Empire is obviously trying to leverage

544
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.983
their possession for a later day.

545
00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:37.468
An end to killing now is better

546
00:25:37.468 --> 00:25:39.775
than no end to the killing.

547
00:25:39.775 --> 00:25:40.733
TALIESIN: Always.

548
00:25:40.733 --> 00:25:44.288
LIAM: But, as far as this meeting goes,

549
00:25:44.288 --> 00:25:47.713
I will happily be mistaken,

550
00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:52.235
but I find it hard to believe

551
00:25:52.235 --> 00:25:54.825
the Martinet and his friends

552
00:25:54.825 --> 00:25:57.215
are genuine in their intentions.

553
00:25:57.215 --> 00:25:58.548
SAM: Of course not.

554
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.355
LIAM: I still fear for the artifact they are returning.

555
00:26:03.355 --> 00:26:05.316
The beacon, I worry that they have tampered

556
00:26:05.316 --> 00:26:06.483
with it somehow.

557
00:26:08.198 --> 00:26:10.718
SAM: Well, we need to be close to the action

558
00:26:10.718 --> 00:26:13.010
when this meeting takes place.

559
00:26:13.993 --> 00:26:15.376
Now more than ever.

560
00:26:15.376 --> 00:26:17.240
MARISHA: We should probably discuss that,

561
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.970
make a little bit of a plan,

562
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.740
that we definitely will not follow.

563
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.716
SAM: Sure, that's what we do.

564
00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:27.974
But if all goes well,

565
00:26:27.974 --> 00:26:31.165
and there's a temporary truce or whatever,

566
00:26:31.165 --> 00:26:35.906
then maybe afterwards, we can use this information to

567
00:26:35.906 --> 00:26:39.942
bring some folks on the Empire side to justice.

568
00:26:39.942 --> 00:26:43.108
TALIESIN: I'm not on board for that.

569
00:26:43.108 --> 00:26:43.941
SAM: What?

570
00:26:45.173 --> 00:26:47.173
TALIESIN: I'm not interested in--

571
00:26:48.042 --> 00:26:50.743
I don't understand what it's for.

572
00:26:50.743 --> 00:26:52.735
SAM: Well, they've done horrible, evil things

573
00:26:52.735 --> 00:26:55.480
that killed thousands of people.

574
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.437
TALIESIN: What if, in our search for punishment,

575
00:26:59.437 --> 00:27:02.367
we create more horrible, evil things?

576
00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:05.208
What if we reignite the war?

577
00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:07.220
LIAM: I think that is very likely, Caduceus.

578
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.880
TALIESIN: I will not stand by and let someone's

579
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.898
desire to feel better get in the way and just--

580
00:27:14.898 --> 00:27:17.939
SAM: You can stand by and--
TALIESIN: -- and end more lives.

581
00:27:17.939 --> 00:27:21.712
SAM: You can just watch bad people get away with it?

582
00:27:21.712 --> 00:27:23.892
TALIESIN: They did what they did.

583
00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:27.097
All we can do-- the best, I think,
we can do is just stop it.

584
00:27:27.097 --> 00:27:28.512
I don't--

585
00:27:28.512 --> 00:27:32.586
I don't see the sense in

586
00:27:32.586 --> 00:27:33.811
risking other people.

587
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:35.767
If there's a way to do it,

588
00:27:36.873 --> 00:27:38.887
if there's a way to do it that's safe,

589
00:27:38.887 --> 00:27:41.620
that maintains the peace,

590
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.340
certainly, but I don't see that.

591
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.391
MARISHA: Maybe there is a way.
TALIESIN: I mean, you're smarter than I am.

592
00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:50.258
Do you see a way of enacting vengeance or justice

593
00:27:50.258 --> 00:27:53.352
or whatever you want to call it,

594
00:27:53.352 --> 00:27:57.097
that will make the dead feel better?

595
00:27:57.097 --> 00:27:59.380
Will make the living feel better?

596
00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.713
Will create more broken lives?

597
00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.677
I just don't see what it's for.

598
00:28:05.677 --> 00:28:08.069
I'm happy to learn, but

599
00:28:09.498 --> 00:28:13.510
it just sounds like more chaos.

600
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:18.083
MARISHA: Sometimes justice can bring closure, Caduceus.

601
00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:20.743
TALIESIN: The only thing I've ever found that brings closure

602
00:28:20.743 --> 00:28:24.180
is when everyone's finally in the ground.

603
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.688
TRAVIS: (laughs)

604
00:28:28.672 --> 00:28:30.255
TALIESIN: From my experience.

605
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.242
LIAM: We have no choice but to see this meeting through.

606
00:28:36.242 --> 00:28:37.075
TALIESIN: Of course.

607
00:28:38.405 --> 00:28:40.705
MARISHA: Yasha, you spent time, most of your life

608
00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:42.649
in the Dynasty.

609
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:44.358
What do you think?

610
00:28:44.358 --> 00:28:49.283
Both sides are guilty here, deeply.

611
00:28:49.283 --> 00:28:51.783
ASHLEY: Yeah, both sides are guilty.

612
00:28:53.218 --> 00:28:56.328
I think I just had a different experience with it.

613
00:28:56.328 --> 00:29:00.517
You know, I mean, my tribe, we floated across the lands

614
00:29:00.517 --> 00:29:04.850
without any connection to either side.

615
00:29:10.002 --> 00:29:13.735
I don't quite know where I stand on this,

616
00:29:13.735 --> 00:29:14.818
to be honest.

617
00:29:18.054 --> 00:29:19.272
MARISHA: Yeah, me neither.

618
00:29:19.272 --> 00:29:21.627
And that's really weird for me.

619
00:29:21.627 --> 00:29:23.453
TALIESIN: I feel no obligation to the guilty,

620
00:29:23.453 --> 00:29:26.803
but I do feel it to the innocent.

621
00:29:26.803 --> 00:29:29.278
SAM: I mean, maybe it's because

622
00:29:29.278 --> 00:29:31.200
I have a personal connection here,

623
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.197
but my husband was kidnapped and imprisoned

624
00:29:35.197 --> 00:29:36.332
partially due to this

625
00:29:36.332 --> 00:29:38.399
by Essek's people.

626
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.612
I'd love to get him some some payback for that.

627
00:29:43.612 --> 00:29:46.120
TALIESIN: Does your husband want payback?

628
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.993
SAM: I don't want to speak for him, but

629
00:29:49.993 --> 00:29:50.851
yes!

630
00:29:50.851 --> 00:29:54.495
(laughter)

631
00:29:54.495 --> 00:29:55.986
MARISHA: There might be a way to do this

632
00:29:55.986 --> 00:29:58.594
slowly and over time,

633
00:29:58.594 --> 00:30:00.290
but not now.

634
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.237
Not any time soon.

635
00:30:02.237 --> 00:30:05.678
LIAM: I agree. I think if we blow this wide open now--

636
00:30:05.678 --> 00:30:10.678
and I fault our country far more heavily

637
00:30:10.678 --> 00:30:11.732
than the Dynasty--

638
00:30:11.732 --> 00:30:16.415
but if we try to grasp justice wildly now,

639
00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:17.705
as you say, Caduceus,

640
00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:22.705
it will spark the conflict and more people will die.

641
00:30:22.817 --> 00:30:24.983
I think

642
00:30:24.983 --> 00:30:28.932
we try to bring this day through,

643
00:30:28.932 --> 00:30:32.047
and then find a way to surgically remove

644
00:30:32.047 --> 00:30:35.638
the problem after the fact,

645
00:30:35.638 --> 00:30:40.195
rather than just blasting it wide open.

646
00:30:40.195 --> 00:30:42.303
MARISHA: No, that would be really dumb.

647
00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:48.885
TALIESIN: Be gentle in your motives, is all I ask.

648
00:30:48.885 --> 00:30:49.718
Always--

649
00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:56.317
It's always worth thinking about what you really want.

650
00:30:56.317 --> 00:30:58.225
It's the only thing that really matters.

651
00:31:02.049 --> 00:31:03.166
MARISHA: This is a--
LIAM: I want

652
00:31:03.166 --> 00:31:06.807
the murders removed from power in my country.

653
00:31:08.518 --> 00:31:09.351
TALIESIN: Why?

654
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.165
Really, why?

655
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.625
LIAM: Because I'm tired of children being thrown on pyre.

656
00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:22.822
TALIESIN: That's what you really don't want.

657
00:31:22.822 --> 00:31:24.702
That's what you want, though.

658
00:31:24.702 --> 00:31:27.910
You want no more children on the pyre.

659
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.660
Always remember that.

660
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:34.475
You don't want to punish the people who made you.

661
00:31:34.475 --> 00:31:38.763
You want to make sure that no one else makes you.

662
00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:40.846
You'll get there quicker.

663
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.468
LIAM: I don't know, Caduceus.

664
00:31:47.468 --> 00:31:48.551
TALIESIN: Me neither.

665
00:31:50.347 --> 00:31:51.930
I will try and help.

666
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.387
No more children.

667
00:31:56.687 --> 00:31:58.520
<i>That</i> I can get behind.

668
00:31:59.658 --> 00:32:02.325
ASHLEY: I can get behind that as well.

669
00:32:04.912 --> 00:32:06.587
MARISHA: Speaking of children,

670
00:32:06.587 --> 00:32:09.095
wonder if Jester's found her mom yet.

671
00:32:09.095 --> 00:32:12.241
SAM: I'm sure she has. Dissolve to--

672
00:32:12.241 --> 00:32:14.330
(scene change noises)

673
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.163
MARISHA: Thank you.

674
00:32:16.102 --> 00:32:19.900
LAURA: (panting) Are we back to the house yet?

675
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.873
MATT: After rushing through the night streets of Nicodranas,

676
00:32:23.873 --> 00:32:27.945
the distant sound of high tide waves crashing on the shore

677
00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:28.852
getting more and more distant

678
00:32:28.852 --> 00:32:30.177
as you pass through the Opal Archways,

679
00:32:30.177 --> 00:32:33.363
you come to the soft, distant sound of music.

680
00:32:33.363 --> 00:32:34.446
TRAVIS: (panting) Slow down!

681
00:32:34.446 --> 00:32:36.910
Slow down, this hat has incredible wind drag.

682
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.054
(laughter)

683
00:32:39.054 --> 00:32:41.052
LAURA: Just take it off already. Just take the hat off!

684
00:32:41.052 --> 00:32:43.735
TRAVIS: But you bought this for me!

685
00:32:43.735 --> 00:32:45.285
LAURA: Fjord. Look at me.

686
00:32:45.285 --> 00:32:46.635
TRAVIS: What?

687
00:32:46.635 --> 00:32:48.491
LAURA: It was a joke.

688
00:32:48.491 --> 00:32:50.201
TRAVIS: What?
LAURA: The hat was a joke.

689
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:51.060
TRAVIS: It can't be.

690
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.796
I've gotten so many compliments on it tonight.

691
00:32:53.796 --> 00:32:55.450
It's part of my look.

692
00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.841
LAURA: If you like it, embrace it, but I got it as a joke.

693
00:32:58.841 --> 00:33:01.573
TRAVIS: Fuck this hat!

694
00:33:01.573 --> 00:33:02.906
SAM: (cat yowling)

695
00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:05.558
MATT: Killed Frumpkin.

696
00:33:05.558 --> 00:33:07.375
LAURA: Do we her singing still?

697
00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:09.469
MATT: No.
LAURA: Fuck.

698
00:33:09.469 --> 00:33:11.648
MATT: You rush up to the gates and the guards are there.

699
00:33:11.648 --> 00:33:13.117
You can see that there's still people in the courtyard

700
00:33:13.117 --> 00:33:15.560
that are currently still talking amongst themselves.

701
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.510
There's soft music playing.

702
00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:21.910
The guards step aside and let you enter the courtyard.

703
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.603
You quickly glance across the entire crew

704
00:33:24.603 --> 00:33:28.018
and you do notice your mother is currently surrounded

705
00:33:28.018 --> 00:33:30.518
by a group about six or seven people.

706
00:33:30.518 --> 00:33:31.963
There's laughter and she's talking,

707
00:33:31.963 --> 00:33:36.355
she has a wine flute in her hand,

708
00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:38.377
and immediately she locks eyes

709
00:33:38.377 --> 00:33:40.223
with you across the way and goes,

710
00:33:40.223 --> 00:33:44.352
"Jester! I was wondering where you went."

711
00:33:44.352 --> 00:33:47.093
LAURA: I got pulled away for a conversation,

712
00:33:47.093 --> 00:33:50.462
but you sounded beautiful, Mama.

713
00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:51.627
MATT: "Thank you very much."

714
00:33:51.627 --> 00:33:53.027
LAURA: You're occupied.

715
00:33:53.027 --> 00:33:55.289
Do you want to continue?

716
00:33:55.289 --> 00:33:57.282
MATT: "Honestly, this has been very nice.

717
00:33:57.282 --> 00:34:01.480
"I'm missing the comfort of my own room.

718
00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.660
"But thank you, everyone.

719
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.173
"It has been a pleasure. To the Marquis,"

720
00:34:06.173 --> 00:34:07.628
and she gives a nod.

721
00:34:07.628 --> 00:34:08.973
LAURA: If you enjoyed her company,

722
00:34:08.973 --> 00:34:10.997
come and see her at the Lavish Chateau.

723
00:34:10.997 --> 00:34:13.596
She appears there (mumbling) every other night, still?

724
00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:17.038
I don't remember. You should check it out!

725
00:34:17.038 --> 00:34:19.078
MATT: "Thank you, Jester."
LAURA: Of course.

726
00:34:19.078 --> 00:34:20.500
MATT: She turns and a few people wave

727
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.547
and she hands her glass over to one of the guards

728
00:34:22.547 --> 00:34:24.031
who's like, "I don't know what to do with this,"

729
00:34:24.031 --> 00:34:26.643
then he just holds it.

730
00:34:26.643 --> 00:34:31.262
And strolls out toward the edge of the gate,

731
00:34:31.262 --> 00:34:34.437
takes a breath, puts her arm around yours,

732
00:34:35.937 --> 00:34:40.870
and then pushes into the night back towards the Chateau.

733
00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.250
LAURA: Fjord, walk on the other side of her, it's helpful.

734
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.583
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.

735
00:34:46.028 --> 00:34:48.727
MATT: "Thank you so much.

736
00:34:48.727 --> 00:34:50.330
"(sighs)

737
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.383
"Well, that was very exhilarating."

738
00:34:52.383 --> 00:34:54.238
LAURA: I'm very proud of you.

739
00:34:54.238 --> 00:34:56.830
MATT: "Thank you."
LAURA: Everyone was so enthralled.

740
00:34:58.635 --> 00:34:59.468
MATT: "Yeah.

741
00:34:59.468 --> 00:35:00.921
"(laughs)

742
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:02.713
"But that's what I do.

743
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.425
"Thank you for helping me with that."

744
00:35:05.425 --> 00:35:10.000
LAURA: Of course. I'm sorry we had
to step away for a moment.

745
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.085
MATT: "I'm sure you had your reasons.

746
00:35:13.085 --> 00:35:14.800
"Thank you for your help."

747
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.050
TRAVIS: Of course. Beau and I were able to stay

748
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:20.376
for a bit more of your performance before

749
00:35:20.376 --> 00:35:21.209
the

750
00:35:22.643 --> 00:35:26.063
night really kicked into a different gear.

751
00:35:26.063 --> 00:35:27.043
It was thrilling, though,

752
00:35:27.043 --> 00:35:29.507
I can see where Jester gets all of her exuberance

753
00:35:29.507 --> 00:35:32.847
and personality. It was quite amazing.

754
00:35:32.847 --> 00:35:33.965
MATT: "Thank you very much.

755
00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:36.343
"What happened to hat?"

756
00:35:36.343 --> 00:35:40.180
TRAVIS: You know, it was such a hit, someone just

757
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.870
up and snatched that bitch in the middle of the party.

758
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.595
MATT: "That is unfortunate!"
TRAVIS: I agree!

759
00:35:45.595 --> 00:35:47.520
It was such--
MATT: "I could have another one made for you."

760
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.253
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh, could you?

761
00:35:50.253 --> 00:35:52.482
(laughter)

762
00:35:52.482 --> 00:35:54.952
MATT: "I'll pull some strings."

763
00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:57.322
LAURA: Yes, and then you'll have to
wear it all the time, Fjord,

764
00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:59.319
because it will be a gift from Mama.

765
00:35:59.319 --> 00:36:01.694
TRAVIS: (drawn out) Uh!

766
00:36:01.694 --> 00:36:03.695
All right, I would love that.

767
00:36:03.695 --> 00:36:04.528
MATT: "I...

768
00:36:06.286 --> 00:36:08.361
"can see your discomfort.

769
00:36:08.361 --> 00:36:09.978
"Do not worry. It's okay."

770
00:36:09.978 --> 00:36:11.795
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I--

771
00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:14.358
LAURA: Just give in, Fjord, just it's okay. Don't do it.

772
00:36:14.358 --> 00:36:16.502
TRAVIS: I-- don't do it or do it?

773
00:36:16.502 --> 00:36:18.327
LAURA: Don't do it!
TRAVIS: Fuck, what?

774
00:36:18.327 --> 00:36:19.747
Um. No.

775
00:36:19.747 --> 00:36:22.945
LAURA: Let what you want to be known to the world.

776
00:36:22.945 --> 00:36:25.517
TRAVIS: I really don't wear a hat very well, it's not--

777
00:36:25.517 --> 00:36:27.690
LAURA: Well, that's not true. You look fabulous in it.

778
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.598
TRAVIS: Fucking pick one.

779
00:36:28.598 --> 00:36:30.568
Which one is it, am I wearing it or not?

780
00:36:30.568 --> 00:36:32.783
LAURA: You aren't going to wear it.

781
00:36:32.783 --> 00:36:35.103
TRAVIS: I don't wear hats--
LAURA: Unless you really want to.

782
00:36:35.103 --> 00:36:37.312
I mean, I don't want to--
TRAVIS: I'll take the hat.

783
00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:40.127
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Rush delivery.

784
00:36:40.127 --> 00:36:41.329
MATT: "So be it."

785
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:44.321
(chuckling)

786
00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:46.975
You guys head back to the Chateau,

787
00:36:46.975 --> 00:36:48.677
escort her back to her room.

788
00:36:48.677 --> 00:36:50.802
It's pretty late now in the evening.

789
00:36:50.802 --> 00:36:54.710
LIAM: Was that conversation too real?
MATT: -- but she goes ahead and-- (laughs)

790
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.957
Kisses you good night.

791
00:36:56.957 --> 00:36:59.090
"Thank you again.

792
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:02.298
"I am, as Jester would say,

793
00:37:02.298 --> 00:37:04.500
"just pooped."

794
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.283
SAM and LAURA: Piew-ped.

795
00:37:06.283 --> 00:37:07.683
MATT "Piew-ped.

796
00:37:07.683 --> 00:37:08.516
"Good night.

797
00:37:08.516 --> 00:37:09.771
LAURA: Good night, Mama.

798
00:37:09.771 --> 00:37:11.925
MATT: She closes the door.

799
00:37:11.925 --> 00:37:13.567
LAURA: Thank you, Fjord.

800
00:37:13.567 --> 00:37:15.542
TRAVIS: You're welcome. She's a charming woman.

801
00:37:15.542 --> 00:37:18.033
I can see why she has all the suitors

802
00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:19.672
and attention everywhere.

803
00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:22.292
LAURA: Everyone really loves her.

804
00:37:22.292 --> 00:37:23.125
Yeah.

805
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:25.918
TRAVIS: I can't feel my hamstrings.

806
00:37:25.918 --> 00:37:28.589
I think I pulled something as we running.
LAURA: We can walk much slower back.

807
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:29.430
TRAVIS: Do you mind?

808
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.968
LAURA: Not at all.
TRAVIS: This coat does not breathe.

809
00:37:30.968 --> 00:37:32.847
It's lovely, but fuck.

810
00:37:32.847 --> 00:37:35.518
LAURA: I wonder what they all decided.

811
00:37:35.518 --> 00:37:37.118
TRAVIS: Who? Oh, yes!

812
00:37:37.118 --> 00:37:38.830
Should we head back to the docks?

813
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.030
LAURA: I mean, probably.

814
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.154
I guess I can send a message
to everyone, see where they are now.

815
00:37:44.154 --> 00:37:46.883
TRAVIS: It's so strange. When the message
doesn't come from you,

816
00:37:46.883 --> 00:37:48.957
it's very alienating.

817
00:37:48.957 --> 00:37:51.212
I think everyone's just used to hearing you send messages.

818
00:37:51.212 --> 00:37:53.210
Caleb's sent me one, it

819
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.587
sent this night down a whole other rabbit trail.

820
00:37:56.587 --> 00:37:58.048
LAURA: Oh, really?
TRAVIS: Yep.

821
00:37:58.048 --> 00:38:00.431
LAURA: Yeah, you and Beau seemed a little--

822
00:38:01.439 --> 00:38:03.968
TRAVIS: Beau was tripping balls!

823
00:38:03.968 --> 00:38:05.148
There was all sorts of things.

824
00:38:05.148 --> 00:38:07.020
She was swinging at stuff that wasn't there.

825
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.523
LAURA: Really?
TRAVIS: Yeah, we unmasked, like, a dragonborn fellow.

826
00:38:09.523 --> 00:38:12.231
I turned around and he just, poof! He was gone.

827
00:38:12.231 --> 00:38:13.147
LAURA: What?!

828
00:38:13.147 --> 00:38:14.170
TRAVIS: I know!

829
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.930
LAURA: What the heck was going on?

830
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.160
TRAVIS: I don't know.
LAURA: I was just trying to talk to Essek,

831
00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.670
and then all this hell broke loose.

832
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.310
TRAVIS: Yeah, we thought we'd keep an eye on the room

833
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.340
and then we thought we were, like,

834
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.327
doing the real investigative digging.

835
00:38:24.327 --> 00:38:26.400
It turns out, nope, we're just fucking things up.

836
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.164
LAURA: I was going to him and then start talking

837
00:38:28.164 --> 00:38:30.327
about how much I liked Essek and then all of a sudden,

838
00:38:30.327 --> 00:38:33.054
like, Nott had paralyzed him or something?

839
00:38:33.054 --> 00:38:36.563
I don't remember, it was weird.

840
00:38:36.563 --> 00:38:38.980
TRAVIS: Nott paralyzed Essek?

841
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.063
LAURA: I think so.

842
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.252
TRAVIS: That's sounds about right.
LAURA: Then Caleb,

843
00:38:42.252 --> 00:38:45.216
you know, put him in chains, so.

844
00:38:45.216 --> 00:38:46.718
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

845
00:38:46.718 --> 00:38:48.817
TRAVIS: Should we get that fellow down from the balcony

846
00:38:48.817 --> 00:38:50.762
that was harassing your mother?

847
00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:51.595
LAURA: Oh.

848
00:38:52.969 --> 00:38:55.240
I should have told Mama about that.

849
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.095
TRAVIS: I mean, there's no way they could trace that

850
00:38:57.095 --> 00:38:58.410
back to you, though.

851
00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.444
LAURA: Oh, well.

852
00:39:01.705 --> 00:39:03.703
I'm pretty sure he saw it was me,

853
00:39:03.703 --> 00:39:06.955
and I'm pretty sure the spell's probably worn off by now.

854
00:39:06.955 --> 00:39:09.790
And I'm pretty sure it's exactly what I did before.

855
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.920
So yeah, he's going to be pretty pissed.

856
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.410
TRAVIS: I think we actually went up there

857
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.802
and tried to scare him a little bit,

858
00:39:14.802 --> 00:39:16.605
so maybe he'll keep his mouth shut.

859
00:39:16.605 --> 00:39:17.596
LAURA: Oh, good.

860
00:39:17.596 --> 00:39:19.955
MATT: And the good news is--

861
00:39:20.963 --> 00:39:22.770
no, it's worn off.

862
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.170
LIAM: No, no good news.
MATT: Never mind, no good news.

863
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.420
LAURA: Yeah, good.
TRAVIS: Good.

864
00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.253
LAURA: Yeah.

865
00:39:31.122 --> 00:39:32.540
TRAVIS: You look lovely this evening.

866
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.873
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

867
00:39:35.087 --> 00:39:37.084
TRAVIS: You did a good job.

868
00:39:37.084 --> 00:39:40.198
We should make this our new vibe.

869
00:39:40.198 --> 00:39:42.527
LAURA: Our new look? We should be
in formal wear all the time.

870
00:39:42.527 --> 00:39:43.618
TRAVIS: I don't know, I think people like,

871
00:39:43.618 --> 00:39:45.482
actually paid us respect.

872
00:39:45.482 --> 00:39:47.866
LAURA: Well, you do look quite dashing;
you look like a captain.

873
00:39:47.866 --> 00:39:49.282
TRAVIS: Thank you, without the hat?

874
00:39:49.282 --> 00:39:50.465
LAURA: Without the hat.

875
00:39:50.465 --> 00:39:52.529
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I went up
to Captain Deremi, guess what?

876
00:39:52.529 --> 00:39:53.973
No fucking hat.

877
00:39:53.973 --> 00:39:57.513
LAURA: Well, maybe a smaller hat. That one was really big.

878
00:39:57.513 --> 00:39:59.682
TRAVIS: He's a dwarf, he didn't have a hat.

879
00:39:59.682 --> 00:40:01.254
LAURA: You don't have--

880
00:40:01.254 --> 00:40:03.154
LAURA and TRAVIS: (random interrupting sounds)

881
00:40:03.154 --> 00:40:04.437
LAURA: Whatever.
TRAVIS: (chicken cluck)

882
00:40:04.437 --> 00:40:07.008
(laughter)

883
00:40:07.008 --> 00:40:10.127
LAURA: Hold on, I'm going to send a message.

884
00:40:10.127 --> 00:40:12.342
Hey everyone, are you still at the docks?

885
00:40:12.342 --> 00:40:14.148
Or are you coming back to the Chateau,

886
00:40:14.148 --> 00:40:15.640
or where should we meet you?

887
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.382
Is (whispers) Essek
(normal volume) still around

888
00:40:19.382 --> 00:40:22.353
or what's going on?
SAM: Who did you send that to?

889
00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.116
MATT: Who did you say that to?

890
00:40:24.116 --> 00:40:24.949
LAURA: Veth.

891
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.030
SAM: Oh! Uh! Um!

892
00:40:31.403 --> 00:40:32.403
Essek gone.

893
00:40:32.403 --> 00:40:34.637
LAURA: She screamed a couple times. Essek is gone.

894
00:40:34.637 --> 00:40:37.204
SAM: Us <i>en route</i>

895
00:40:37.204 --> 00:40:38.037
to

896
00:40:38.037 --> 00:40:39.270
Chateau.

897
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.630
LAURA: She's really bad at this.

898
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.756
SAM: Stopping for quick bite.
LAURA: Oh!

899
00:40:45.601 --> 00:40:50.123
SAM: Tell if you need us pick up anything.

900
00:40:50.123 --> 00:40:51.284
Fire bad.

901
00:40:51.284 --> 00:40:55.118
(laughter)

902
00:40:55.118 --> 00:40:59.377
LAURA: Yeah, she suggested before that I use less words

903
00:40:59.377 --> 00:41:01.330
and make more ideas present,

904
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.828
but it was very confusing when she just did it.

905
00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:05.378
So, yeah.

906
00:41:05.378 --> 00:41:08.083
I think they're going to get some dinner or something.

907
00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:10.428
But she didn't say where.

908
00:41:10.428 --> 00:41:14.436
TRAVIS: Oh shit. I mean, do we want to--
can you send another one?

909
00:41:14.436 --> 00:41:15.602
LAURA: (sighs)

910
00:41:15.602 --> 00:41:18.180
As long as we go to sleep.

911
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.063
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, we can just grab a bite.

912
00:41:21.063 --> 00:41:22.533
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, they're on their way back,

913
00:41:22.533 --> 00:41:23.688
we might as well just

914
00:41:23.688 --> 00:41:26.253
go get something. Maybe we'll find them there.

915
00:41:26.253 --> 00:41:29.208
TRAVIS: Do you have a favorite spot around here?

916
00:41:29.208 --> 00:41:32.253
LAURA: I didn't really go out very much for food.

917
00:41:32.253 --> 00:41:34.013
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, you hid.

918
00:41:34.013 --> 00:41:35.846
LAURA: Well.
TRAVIS: We could order in.

919
00:41:35.846 --> 00:41:38.768
LAURA: Yeah, they've got wonderful food downstairs.

920
00:41:38.768 --> 00:41:39.601
TRAVIS: Yeah.

921
00:41:39.601 --> 00:41:44.085
LAURA: Okay, all right, we're going to
go downstairs and eat at the Chateau.

922
00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:46.647
MATT: All right, so you guys have a Chateau dinner.

923
00:41:46.647 --> 00:41:49.174
The rest of you guys.

924
00:41:49.174 --> 00:41:50.007
What are you doing?

925
00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:51.598
SAM: We're walking back.
MATT: All right.

926
00:41:51.598 --> 00:41:54.407
TALIESIN: (plucked bass notes)
MATT: So you're picking up a snack

927
00:41:54.407 --> 00:41:55.623
on the way? Sure.
TRAVIS, ASHLEY, and TALIESIN: (plucked bass notes)

928
00:41:55.623 --> 00:41:56.481
SAM: Yeah!
MATT: All right.

929
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:57.948
SAM: We're going to a herring stand.

930
00:41:57.948 --> 00:42:00.914
MATT: All right, the fish market, real popular recently.

931
00:42:00.914 --> 00:42:02.555
SAM: Uh-huh.

932
00:42:02.555 --> 00:42:03.795
MATT: Okay.

933
00:42:03.795 --> 00:42:04.988
You guys come back to the Chateau

934
00:42:04.988 --> 00:42:07.987
and you catch up as Jester and Fjord are eating,

935
00:42:07.987 --> 00:42:10.130
finishing up their meal down within the main area,

936
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:11.100
which is mostly empty now.

937
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.528
SAM: Is it that candlelit, is it?

938
00:42:13.528 --> 00:42:15.863
Are we walking in on anything?

939
00:42:15.863 --> 00:42:18.093
LAURA: We're just sitting at a table, having some food.

940
00:42:18.093 --> 00:42:19.302
TRAVIS: Do you want some ice cream?

941
00:42:19.302 --> 00:42:20.335
SAM: (gasps)

942
00:42:20.335 --> 00:42:22.159
Oh, hi.

943
00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:23.990
LAURA: They've got really got the ice cream here.

944
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.315
How did it go?

945
00:42:26.392 --> 00:42:28.125
SAM: So good.

946
00:42:28.125 --> 00:42:30.722
TALIESIN: I mean, all things considered.

947
00:42:30.722 --> 00:42:33.305
LIAM: It's pretty delicate, actually.

948
00:42:34.539 --> 00:42:35.463
We let him go.

949
00:42:35.463 --> 00:42:36.454
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Okay.

950
00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:37.612
TRAVIS: Alive?

951
00:42:37.612 --> 00:42:38.445
LIAM: For now.

952
00:42:38.445 --> 00:42:39.475
LAURA: Well yeah, he's--
TRAVIS: I'm just--

953
00:42:39.475 --> 00:42:40.308
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

954
00:42:41.591 --> 00:42:43.907
LIAM: (slopping on the ground)

955
00:42:43.907 --> 00:42:45.203
TRAVIS: (groaning)

956
00:42:45.203 --> 00:42:46.487
TALIESIN: Out to sea.

957
00:42:47.687 --> 00:42:48.650
Be free.

958
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:51.523
(laughter)

959
00:42:51.523 --> 00:42:52.620
SAM: We're going to keep our eye on him.

960
00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.597
We're going to make sure that this truce thing happens,

961
00:42:54.597 --> 00:42:58.222
and then afterwards, there's a bit of an internal debate

962
00:42:58.222 --> 00:43:00.888
about whether we are going to go on a

963
00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.545
on the trail of blood and redemption and justice,

964
00:43:06.545 --> 00:43:09.873
or if we are going to just simply turn a blind eye

965
00:43:09.873 --> 00:43:10.968
to all of the wrongs

966
00:43:10.968 --> 00:43:13.663
that have been committed in the last few years,

967
00:43:13.663 --> 00:43:15.638
or somewhere in between.

968
00:43:15.638 --> 00:43:18.548
At the end, there was sort of floated an idea

969
00:43:18.548 --> 00:43:20.733
that we would become an elite ninja force

970
00:43:20.733 --> 00:43:25.313
that would go in and just very quietly kill those

971
00:43:25.313 --> 00:43:27.433
or at least capture those who were responsible

972
00:43:27.433 --> 00:43:29.943
without causing any other ripples in the society.

973
00:43:29.943 --> 00:43:32.378
LAURA: I like being a task force. Let's be a task force.

974
00:43:32.378 --> 00:43:33.938
TRAVIS: Whose idea was the ninja force?

975
00:43:33.938 --> 00:43:36.487
MARISHA: That was (stuttering).
SAM: That was Caleb's. I think it was Caleb.

976
00:43:36.487 --> 00:43:37.387
LAURA: Caleb, you're so smart.

977
00:43:37.387 --> 00:43:39.862
That sounds like so much fun.
TRAVIS: You have access to ninja training?

978
00:43:39.862 --> 00:43:40.988
LAURA: I wonder-- you know what,

979
00:43:40.988 --> 00:43:45.769
I could probably get some costumes made for us.
SAM: Bob bob!

980
00:43:45.769 --> 00:43:47.326
TALIESIN: I feel like both sides of that debate

981
00:43:47.326 --> 00:43:50.188
were a little more nuanced, but yeah, it's kind of--

982
00:43:50.188 --> 00:43:52.482
LIAM: I think we clearly need
to let off a little bit of steam.

983
00:43:52.482 --> 00:43:55.632
This has been a very long day.

984
00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:56.465
TALIESIN: Very long day.

985
00:43:56.465 --> 00:43:59.699
TRAVIS: Can I ask: Did you believe him when you let him go?

986
00:44:02.093 --> 00:44:03.776
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

987
00:44:03.776 --> 00:44:08.776
MARISHA: He seems like he has
a lot to lose and a lot at stake.

988
00:44:08.885 --> 00:44:10.620
TALIESIN: Could have had a better lie.

989
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.952
MARISHA: Yeah.

990
00:44:11.952 --> 00:44:13.387
TRAVIS: All right, that's good enough for me.

991
00:44:13.387 --> 00:44:16.087
LAURA: I'm going to send the message to Essek.

992
00:44:16.087 --> 00:44:17.137
MATT: Mmkay.

993
00:44:17.137 --> 00:44:19.342
SAM: Now, you don't need verbs or anything.

994
00:44:19.342 --> 00:44:21.135
You can just cut right through to the nouns.

995
00:44:21.135 --> 00:44:22.961
LAURA: Your message was <i>terrible</i>.

996
00:44:22.961 --> 00:44:24.681
SAM: You understood what I said!

997
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:26.845
LAURA: Barely! It took a lot of thought.

998
00:44:26.845 --> 00:44:29.832
It's much better to just talk to them.

999
00:44:29.832 --> 00:44:31.749
LIAM: Just use vowels.

1000
00:44:31.749 --> 00:44:35.074
LAURA and TRAVIS: Ow-ooh. Ow-ooh-ow.

1001
00:44:37.106 --> 00:44:38.614
SAM: Ah-ooh.

1002
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.343
LAURA: Um!

1003
00:44:41.728 --> 00:44:43.788
Hi, how are you feeling?

1004
00:44:43.788 --> 00:44:46.735
Do you feel guilty or are you happy?

1005
00:44:46.735 --> 00:44:49.075
Are you just crying in your room right now?

1006
00:44:49.075 --> 00:44:51.150
We're thinking about you!

1007
00:44:54.102 --> 00:44:57.823
MATT: A brief pause before the response comes.

1008
00:44:57.823 --> 00:45:00.873
"I am just

1009
00:45:00.873 --> 00:45:04.114
"contemplating what is to come.

1010
00:45:05.483 --> 00:45:10.408
"I appreciate what silver of trust

1011
00:45:11.242 --> 00:45:12.909
"allowed me to leave.

1012
00:45:14.522 --> 00:45:16.105
"It's not forgotten."

1013
00:45:18.405 --> 00:45:19.472
That's it.

1014
00:45:19.472 --> 00:45:21.348
LAURA: He said he's just sitting there,

1015
00:45:21.348 --> 00:45:24.440
thinking about you kissing him, Caleb.

1016
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.452
It's all he said. He's just like, "Caleb kissed me."

1017
00:45:27.452 --> 00:45:28.985
LIAM: Sure, that checks out.

1018
00:45:28.985 --> 00:45:30.872
TALIESIN: No, it's not what he said.

1019
00:45:30.872 --> 00:45:34.980
LIAM: The reality is we don't trust him, no.

1020
00:45:36.568 --> 00:45:40.760
And redemption for him is a long shot at best, but...

1021
00:45:41.807 --> 00:45:42.640
TALIESIN: True.

1022
00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:47.876
LIAM: I mean, you held a sword to my neck once upon a time.

1023
00:45:48.993 --> 00:45:50.277
TRAVIS: That's true.

1024
00:45:51.543 --> 00:45:55.126
LIAM: I'm not saying ignore what he's done, but

1025
00:45:56.853 --> 00:46:01.320
he has a great many more footsteps to take if he

1026
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.028
indeed wishes to make up for what he has done.

1027
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.077
It's very unlikely.

1028
00:46:09.077 --> 00:46:12.020
TRAVIS: He'd have to earn it, one step at a time.

1029
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.770
TALIESIN: One step at a time.

1030
00:46:16.389 --> 00:46:17.427
MARISHA: Glide.

1031
00:46:17.427 --> 00:46:18.927
SAM: One glide at a time.

1032
00:46:18.927 --> 00:46:20.922
TALIESIN: One, that's-- wow. I hadn't even really.

1033
00:46:20.922 --> 00:46:22.788
LIAM: It's really just one--
MARISHA: It's just, like, a waft.

1034
00:46:22.788 --> 00:46:25.340
TRAVIS: He could just be treadmilling
under that shit, you don't know.

1035
00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.443
Just to keep track of where he's going.
SAM: (quick footsteps)

1036
00:46:27.443 --> 00:46:30.309
TRAVIS: Yeah, otherwise his legs would just atrophy, right?

1037
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:32.026
LAURA: That's true, they would.

1038
00:46:32.026 --> 00:46:33.226
Maybe he does a lot of squats

1039
00:46:33.226 --> 00:46:35.067
when nobody's around.
SAM: When he's at home? Yeah.

1040
00:46:35.067 --> 00:46:36.620
TALIESIN: Maybe he's just taller and it's just--
TRAVIS: Air squats?

1041
00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.360
SAM: Air squats?

1042
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.312
Good one.

1043
00:46:39.312 --> 00:46:40.399
LIAM: And--

1044
00:46:40.399 --> 00:46:42.340
SAM: I didn't know you knew what that was!

1045
00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.173
TRAVIS: What?

1046
00:46:43.173 --> 00:46:46.709
SAM: An air squat, 'cause it's
clear that you've ever done one.

1047
00:46:46.709 --> 00:46:48.063
LIAM: What is an air squat?

1048
00:46:48.063 --> 00:46:49.396
SAM: Oh it's...

1049
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.719
I don't actually know.

1050
00:46:51.719 --> 00:46:55.449
(laughter)

1051
00:46:55.449 --> 00:46:56.790
TALIESIN: I was really invested in...

1052
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:58.666
(laughter)

1053
00:46:58.666 --> 00:47:00.850
SAM: I don't know. Maybe you jump at the end? I don't know.

1054
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:03.747
(laughter)

1055
00:47:03.747 --> 00:47:05.172
TRAVIS: Those are jump squats.

1056
00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:08.538
LIAM: Also truth be told, obviously we do not trust him,

1057
00:47:08.538 --> 00:47:10.382
but we know more now than we did before

1058
00:47:10.382 --> 00:47:13.730
and we can potentially use the man.

1059
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.517
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: This is true.

1060
00:47:15.517 --> 00:47:17.462
TRAVIS: Did it change your opinion
of what we're supposed to do:

1061
00:47:17.462 --> 00:47:19.722
head out to sea or stay?

1062
00:47:19.722 --> 00:47:21.463
MARISHA: We head out to sea.

1063
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.067
Plan stays the same.

1064
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.480
If any justice is going to come from this,

1065
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.264
it's going to be a long game.

1066
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.730
And one that I don't think we want to act upon

1067
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:39.010
in the weeks before or after the trade. Not for a bit.

1068
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.692
LIAM: They were all just looking for an excuse

1069
00:47:40.692 --> 00:47:43.940
to throw this piece out the window.

1070
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.730
LAURA: Yeah, regardless, I mean,

1071
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.645
right now they are actually talking about peace.

1072
00:47:49.645 --> 00:47:51.420
That's pretty wonderful.

1073
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.123
MARISHA: Sort of peace.

1074
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.430
Tenuous peace.

1075
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.263
SAM: Truce.

1076
00:47:57.263 --> 00:47:58.096
LAURA: A truce.

1077
00:47:58.096 --> 00:47:59.755
TRAVIS: Greater effect peace.

1078
00:47:59.755 --> 00:48:00.657
MARISHA: Peace on the outside.

1079
00:48:00.657 --> 00:48:01.582
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1080
00:48:01.582 --> 00:48:03.777
LAURA: Less people getting killed, peace.

1081
00:48:03.777 --> 00:48:05.778
LIAM: They're obviously using the situation,

1082
00:48:05.778 --> 00:48:08.570
but maybe we can use them in return.

1083
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.070
Long game, like you say.

1084
00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:11.903
MARISHA: Long game.

1085
00:48:11.903 --> 00:48:14.210
SAM: When do they depart again? Is it imminent

1086
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.270
or do we have a few--

1087
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.103
MATT: It's a couple days.
TRAVIS: Couple days?

1088
00:48:16.103 --> 00:48:17.472
SAM: Couple days.

1089
00:48:17.472 --> 00:48:21.463
Well, should we start thinking about

1090
00:48:21.463 --> 00:48:23.790
any fortifications

1091
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.567
to the Balleater or any sort of, I don't know,

1092
00:48:26.567 --> 00:48:28.185
do we need to be prepared?
LAURA: Oh my gosh,

1093
00:48:28.185 --> 00:48:30.253
are they going to bust out in a battle or something?

1094
00:48:30.253 --> 00:48:33.426
Is somebody, like, lying?
SAM: So many things could happen.

1095
00:48:33.426 --> 00:48:34.409
LAURA: Oh, man.
TRAVIS: We actually do have

1096
00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:37.050
a fair amount of canon on the ship.

1097
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:38.789
I just don't know how much we could have

1098
00:48:38.789 --> 00:48:42.191
without really reducing the speed.

1099
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:44.511
TALIESIN: I think, more than anything,

1100
00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:45.794
we're going to be important to be there.

1101
00:48:45.794 --> 00:48:48.887
We're all a lot to reckon with.

1102
00:48:48.887 --> 00:48:51.054
Any one of us in a fray.

1103
00:48:52.707 --> 00:48:54.165
TRAVIS: And a fracas!

1104
00:48:54.165 --> 00:48:56.738
TALIESIN: Oh, and a fracas. Yeah.

1105
00:48:56.738 --> 00:48:59.221
TRAVIS: Sorry, that party has got me amped.

1106
00:48:59.221 --> 00:49:00.272
TALIESIN: That was a pretty good party.

1107
00:49:00.272 --> 00:49:01.372
TRAVIS: Still got the ringing in my ears.

1108
00:49:01.372 --> 00:49:03.736
TALIESIN: How're you holding up, Beau?
MARISHA: Oh, great.

1109
00:49:03.736 --> 00:49:05.461
That was awesome.

1110
00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:06.656
TALIESIN: You're going to feel a little weird

1111
00:49:06.656 --> 00:49:08.323
in a couple days, just--
MARISHA: What?

1112
00:49:08.323 --> 00:49:10.598
TALIESIN: Nothing, just drink some--

1113
00:49:10.598 --> 00:49:12.180
drink some juice.

1114
00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.890
Try to lay off the ale a little bit and get some sleep

1115
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:18.413
if you're feeling a little low.

1116
00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:19.246
You'll be okay.

1117
00:49:19.246 --> 00:49:20.308
LIAM: Take an off day.

1118
00:49:20.308 --> 00:49:22.450
TALIESIN: Yeah, just take it easy.

1119
00:49:24.173 --> 00:49:25.080
There you go.

1120
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.912
LAURA: Everybody save their outfits

1121
00:49:26.912 --> 00:49:30.113
because you all look really wonderful. Okay?

1122
00:49:30.113 --> 00:49:31.335
SAM: Did you say save your--?

1123
00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.338
LAURA: Yeah, don't leave them here.

1124
00:49:33.338 --> 00:49:36.812
Take them with us in case we want
to dress up some other time.

1125
00:49:36.812 --> 00:49:38.598
LIAM: If you prefer, I could--

1126
00:49:38.598 --> 00:49:39.614
TALIESIN: You look good.
ASHLEY: Thanks.

1127
00:49:39.614 --> 00:49:41.080
LIAM: And then I pull out that little piece of amber.

1128
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.410
I could store them in here for safekeeping,

1129
00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.310
so they do not get ruined.

1130
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.413
LAURA: That's wonderful, yeah.
SAM: What's that do?

1131
00:49:48.413 --> 00:49:50.525
LIAM: Isn't it obvious?

1132
00:49:50.525 --> 00:49:52.150
SAM: No.

1133
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:53.483
LIAM: It holds things.

1134
00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:57.303
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, of course. Amber of holding.

1135
00:49:57.303 --> 00:49:59.046
ASHLEY: How much can you put in there?

1136
00:49:59.046 --> 00:50:00.571
LIAM: A good bit.

1137
00:50:00.571 --> 00:50:02.505
I could put you in it if you were dead.

1138
00:50:02.505 --> 00:50:03.790
LAURA: Oh, if we were dead.
ASHLEY: If I was dead.

1139
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:05.570
LAURA: If we were alive...
ASHLEY: Can I go in there now?

1140
00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.373
LIAM: Yes, but then you would be dead.

1141
00:50:07.373 --> 00:50:09.947
TRAVIS: Instantly or, like, would you have a couple seconds?

1142
00:50:09.947 --> 00:50:11.030
LIAM: Pretty quick.

1143
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:12.282
MARISHA: Would you, like, suffocate?

1144
00:50:12.282 --> 00:50:13.740
How does it work? Is it, like, a vacuum?

1145
00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.830
LAURA: Do you explode?

1146
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.595
MARISHA: Yeah, does it just crush your eyeballs?

1147
00:50:16.595 --> 00:50:19.631
LIAM: You go somewhere else and there is no air.

1148
00:50:19.631 --> 00:50:21.937
LAURA: Oh, so as long as you can
hold your breath, you're fine.

1149
00:50:21.937 --> 00:50:23.528
TRAVIS: Do it now. Do it to Yasha. Do it right now.

1150
00:50:23.528 --> 00:50:25.387
TALIESIN: Yeah I-- hmm.

1151
00:50:25.387 --> 00:50:26.930
TRAVIS: Is it cold, is it hot?

1152
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.108
LIAM: I think maybe stick to pit fights

1153
00:50:29.108 --> 00:50:30.748
where you let yourself get wailed upon

1154
00:50:30.748 --> 00:50:31.790
and maybe don't jump in.

1155
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.492
TRAVIS: This is like Event Horizon.

1156
00:50:33.492 --> 00:50:35.258
Go through the portal. She'll
come right back. It'll be fine.

1157
00:50:35.258 --> 00:50:37.225
TALIESIN: This is like Flatliners.
It's not like Event Horizon.

1158
00:50:37.225 --> 00:50:39.883
TRAVIS: Hey no. Both of those things
ended up terribly for the people.

1159
00:50:39.883 --> 00:50:41.846
LIAM: Yeah, The Long Jump.

1160
00:50:41.846 --> 00:50:43.626
It's longer then you think.

1161
00:50:43.626 --> 00:50:45.378
Longer than you think!

1162
00:50:45.378 --> 00:50:46.983
(laughter)

1163
00:50:46.983 --> 00:50:49.922
TALIESIN: You have a piece of amber that holds stuff?

1164
00:50:49.922 --> 00:50:50.972
LIAM: Yeah.

1165
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.825
TALIESIN: That's great.
LIAM: I like to, you know, I--

1166
00:50:55.825 --> 00:50:57.095
ASHLEY: How do you get stuff out?

1167
00:50:57.095 --> 00:50:59.322
You just stick your hand in it or something?

1168
00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:00.503
TALIESIN: Where would you--?

1169
00:51:00.503 --> 00:51:02.843
LAURA: Do you have to cast the spell to bamf it out again?

1170
00:51:02.843 --> 00:51:04.237
SAM: What do you call it?

1171
00:51:04.237 --> 00:51:07.876
Do you call it Widogast's Plane? Is that what you call it?

1172
00:51:07.876 --> 00:51:09.443
LIAM: I call it Widogast's--

1173
00:51:09.443 --> 00:51:11.410
I just call it the Vault of Amber.

1174
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.010
LAURA: But it's Widogast's Vault of Amber.
SAM: Widogast's Vault of Amber.

1175
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:15.500
That sounds really catchy.

1176
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.193
LAURA: That does sound catchy.
TRAVIS: W-V-O-A.

1177
00:51:18.193 --> 00:51:21.330
LIAM: I mean, only if you were to put into some sort of

1178
00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.805
player's handbook or something.

1179
00:51:23.805 --> 00:51:25.188
SAM: Something that would last forever

1180
00:51:25.188 --> 00:51:26.592
and sort of immortalize your name

1181
00:51:26.592 --> 00:51:27.930
in canon forever.

1182
00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.221
TALIESIN: Let's not get ridiculous.

1183
00:51:29.221 --> 00:51:31.296
TRAVIS: Like a player? Like "play-ah."

1184
00:51:31.296 --> 00:51:33.037
LIAM: Like you, Fjord, like you.

1185
00:51:33.037 --> 00:51:35.857
MARISHA: You do have a very forward
sense of branding, Caleb.

1186
00:51:35.857 --> 00:51:36.690
SAM: Yeah.

1187
00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:38.192
I could see what that would be.

1188
00:51:38.192 --> 00:51:40.192
LIAM: Do I really? I'm not using my actual name.

1189
00:51:40.192 --> 00:51:42.033
TRAVIS: You know what a great friend might do?

1190
00:51:42.033 --> 00:51:44.474
(laughter)

1191
00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:48.687
LAURA: Yeah, let's put it in your amber.

1192
00:51:48.687 --> 00:51:50.940
TALIESIN: I actually, I would love to see how things

1193
00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:52.400
come in and out of it, just in case you're--

1194
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.884
ASHLEY: What happens if I put my finger in and out?

1195
00:51:55.884 --> 00:51:56.810
LIAM: You would have four fingers.

1196
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.868
ASHLEY: It would just fall off.

1197
00:51:58.868 --> 00:52:01.090
LAURA: It would, like, clamp into her finger and--?

1198
00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:02.600
LIAM: I mean, there's only one way to find out.

1199
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.081
TRAVIS: Does it have teeth?

1200
00:52:06.015 --> 00:52:06.928
LIAM: Her finger?

1201
00:52:06.928 --> 00:52:08.493
(snorting)

1202
00:52:08.493 --> 00:52:10.132
ASHLEY: You better believe they have teeth.

1203
00:52:10.132 --> 00:52:13.215
(laughter)

1204
00:52:14.767 --> 00:52:16.415
LIAM: Where are we?
LAURA: Let's go to sleep.

1205
00:52:16.415 --> 00:52:17.623
MATT: You guys are in the Chateau.

1206
00:52:17.623 --> 00:52:19.027
I'm just waiting for you guys to finish--

1207
00:52:19.027 --> 00:52:21.742
LIAM: He starts putting out the ring of--

1208
00:52:21.742 --> 00:52:23.810
LAURA: We're in our clothes now. What,
are we all just going to get naked

1209
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:25.673
right now in the middle of the bar?

1210
00:52:25.673 --> 00:52:27.723
LIAM: She was curious. She wanted to lose a finger.

1211
00:52:27.723 --> 00:52:30.821
SAM: I wouldn't mind. I have a wonderful body now.

1212
00:52:30.821 --> 00:52:32.490
(laughter)

1213
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.518
TALIESIN: Show us how it works. Here's an ascot.

1214
00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:36.520
LIAM: An asker? Oh, you mean an ascot.

1215
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.078
TALIESIN: Just show us how it works.

1216
00:52:38.078 --> 00:52:40.653
LIAM: All right, so he puts out the five pieces of amber,

1217
00:52:40.653 --> 00:52:43.470
but it takes a while, so you strip naked, I guess,

1218
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:47.178
while I cast some mumbo jumbo and...

1219
00:52:48.895 --> 00:52:51.270
the ascot goes (sucking sound). And it's gone.

1220
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:53.248
TALIESIN: How do you get it back?

1221
00:52:53.248 --> 00:52:54.466
LIAM: Uh...

1222
00:52:54.466 --> 00:52:55.299
TRAVIS: Oops.

1223
00:52:56.308 --> 00:52:57.675
LIAM: Una.

1224
00:52:57.675 --> 00:52:58.812
LAURA: What did he say?

1225
00:52:58.812 --> 00:53:01.016
TRAVIS: Unagi.
MARISHA: Uno.

1226
00:53:01.016 --> 00:53:02.407
LIAM: And the

1227
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.890
ascot reappears.

1228
00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.660
LAURA: Una, Una, Una! Is there anything else in there?

1229
00:53:10.602 --> 00:53:12.283
LIAM: No.

1230
00:53:12.283 --> 00:53:13.463
LAURA: Is it like saying Siri?

1231
00:53:13.463 --> 00:53:15.971
Like does it open up if anybody says it?

1232
00:53:15.971 --> 00:53:19.087
ALL: (imitating Jester) Hey, Siri.

1233
00:53:19.087 --> 00:53:20.775
TRAVIS: You know, Caleb, what a great wizard would do

1234
00:53:20.775 --> 00:53:25.097
would be to name new spells after all of his friends.

1235
00:53:25.097 --> 00:53:27.603
You know, spread the love.

1236
00:53:27.603 --> 00:53:29.000
LIAM: I will take that into consideration.

1237
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:29.833
MARISHA: What about like--

1238
00:53:29.833 --> 00:53:33.570
TRAVIS: If there's a waiting list, I'm
at the top. Sorry, go ahead.

1239
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:35.500
MARISHA: You know, like a joint combo.

1240
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:40.484
LIAM: Like pizza combo on nachos. Widogast's Nacho Combos.

1241
00:53:42.159 --> 00:53:45.127
TRAVIS: I would equip that every morning.

1242
00:53:45.127 --> 00:53:47.512
TALIESIN: Like not <i>your</i> combos.

1243
00:53:47.512 --> 00:53:49.386
(laughter)

1244
00:53:49.386 --> 00:53:51.517
LAURA: Okay, good night.
TRAVIS: Okay, good night!

1245
00:53:51.517 --> 00:53:52.642
MATT: All right.

1246
00:53:52.642 --> 00:53:55.130
You guys go to your respective rooms.

1247
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:58.340
You have your full rest for the night.

1248
00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.110
There are two days before the armada leaves.

1249
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:02.680
You guys can just leave early if you want,

1250
00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.845
or you can leave with them,

1251
00:54:03.845 --> 00:54:05.360
or you can accomplish anything in the next few days

1252
00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.443
you want to here in Nicodranas before you head out.

1253
00:54:08.443 --> 00:54:10.440
What would you like to do?

1254
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.395
LAURA: I'm just going to go to the store,

1255
00:54:12.395 --> 00:54:16.327
and I'm going to buy some party decorations,

1256
00:54:16.327 --> 00:54:19.310
and, like, long strips of, like, fabric

1257
00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:21.272
'cause I noticed that the party that we were at,

1258
00:54:21.272 --> 00:54:23.440
you know, they have that fabric stuff draping everywhere.

1259
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.760
I thought that looked really cool,

1260
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.490
so I'm going to get some of that stuff going.

1261
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:27.531
MATT: Okay.

1262
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:31.195
LAURA: Probably, like...

1263
00:54:32.595 --> 00:54:35.286
we already have a lot of clay.

1264
00:54:35.286 --> 00:54:39.117
Maybe I'll make a lot of little figurines.

1265
00:54:39.117 --> 00:54:40.543
Yeah, I'm going to buy some clay,

1266
00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:43.460
so I can do some sculpting on the boat.

1267
00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:46.365
MATT: All right.

1268
00:54:46.365 --> 00:54:47.790
LAURA: Yeah.

1269
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.705
MATT: I'll say with all of those materials purchased,

1270
00:54:50.705 --> 00:54:55.096
that'll run you two and a half gold.

1271
00:54:55.096 --> 00:54:56.272
LAURA: Got it.

1272
00:54:56.272 --> 00:54:57.713
I'm talking lots of stuff.

1273
00:54:57.713 --> 00:55:01.225
I've got to make it for how many people, like 200 people?

1274
00:55:01.225 --> 00:55:02.575
MATT: Oh, this is for...?

1275
00:55:02.575 --> 00:55:03.961
LAURA: Party favors.

1276
00:55:03.961 --> 00:55:06.129
MATT: Okay that's a lot of people, sorry.

1277
00:55:06.129 --> 00:55:08.426
We'll put that at 25 gold.

1278
00:55:08.426 --> 00:55:09.684
LAURA: Like this big.

1279
00:55:09.684 --> 00:55:10.517
Mm-kay.

1280
00:55:13.537 --> 00:55:16.010
MATT: Does anybody else want anything
in Nicodranas or anything before we--

1281
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:19.551
SAM: I'm spending two full days and nights with my family.

1282
00:55:19.551 --> 00:55:21.051
MATT: Mm-hmm.
SAM: That's it.

1283
00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:23.173
MATT: All right, perfect. Anybody else?

1284
00:55:23.173 --> 00:55:26.340
LIAM: Yeah, I will go and
visit Yussa at his tower.

1285
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:30.220
No, no. Scratch that.

1286
00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:33.710
I will spend two days in our lodging

1287
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.380
tinkering with that collar.

1288
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.822
MATT: Okay, got it.

1289
00:55:37.822 --> 00:55:42.264
LIAM: I'm trying to ascertain
what I might use to power...

1290
00:55:43.364 --> 00:55:45.110
power it.

1291
00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.210
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: As we previously discussed.

1292
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.043
MATT: Okay.

1293
00:55:50.509 --> 00:55:52.100
Roll an arcana check.

1294
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.925
LIAM: I will definitely in those two days

1295
00:55:53.925 --> 00:55:55.891
cast Fortune's Favor on myself.

1296
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:57.515
MATT: (chuckles)

1297
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:03.783
LIAM: A natural 20, for a total of 30.

1298
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:06.619
SAM: Ooh.
MARISHA: Dang.

1299
00:56:06.619 --> 00:56:07.810
MATT: Um...

1300
00:56:08.761 --> 00:56:09.594
Okay.

1301
00:56:13.163 --> 00:56:15.073
You can ascertain that there is a particular

1302
00:56:15.073 --> 00:56:19.415
kind of material that was utilized

1303
00:56:19.415 --> 00:56:21.140
to power this device.

1304
00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.052
Role a history check as well.

1305
00:56:27.052 --> 00:56:28.985
SAM: Ooh, double roll.

1306
00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:30.740
LIAM: This is all taking place in two days?

1307
00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.102
MATT: This is, like, over the period of time--

1308
00:56:32.102 --> 00:56:35.360
LIAM: Can I Fortune Favor
myself for these in two days?

1309
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.548
MATT: I'll-- actually no, for this I'd say

1310
00:56:37.548 --> 00:56:40.435
because this is a momentary epiphany.

1311
00:56:40.435 --> 00:56:41.668
LIAM: You da boss.

1312
00:56:43.068 --> 00:56:44.426
History, you said?
MATT: Yes.

1313
00:56:44.426 --> 00:56:46.654
LIAM: Total of 23.

1314
00:56:46.654 --> 00:56:47.721
MATT: Okay.

1315
00:56:50.415 --> 00:56:54.295
You do recognize that whatever
was used to power this,

1316
00:56:54.295 --> 00:56:56.105
as well as possibly the the golems

1317
00:56:56.105 --> 00:56:59.447
within Halas' Folding Halls,

1318
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.467
that this material does not exist naturally.

1319
00:57:06.332 --> 00:57:09.387
You don't know the name of it,

1320
00:57:09.387 --> 00:57:10.541
but it was utilized

1321
00:57:10.541 --> 00:57:14.124
as essentially an arcane
battery-type technology

1322
00:57:14.124 --> 00:57:17.824
that was employed by some of

1323
00:57:17.824 --> 00:57:20.199
the top echelon of archmages

1324
00:57:20.199 --> 00:57:22.292
during the Age of Arcanum.

1325
00:57:24.422 --> 00:57:27.708
You would know that some elements of it

1326
00:57:27.708 --> 00:57:31.037
have supposedly been traded around,

1327
00:57:31.037 --> 00:57:33.153
usually scavenged from ruins.

1328
00:57:34.037 --> 00:57:37.780
What elements you've heard of, coming from the north.

1329
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:38.613
LIAM: From the north.

1330
00:57:38.613 --> 00:57:43.560
And is this possibly connected
to these cities floating in the sky?

1331
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.890
MATT: Possibly, yeah.

1332
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:47.351
And you do know, it wasn't like,

1333
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:48.502
every city was floating.

1334
00:57:48.502 --> 00:57:51.955
There were there maybe three major cities

1335
00:57:51.955 --> 00:57:55.746
that themselves utilized
and had cornered the market

1336
00:57:55.746 --> 00:57:59.880
on brumstone and were able to
hold their entire city aloft.

1337
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.790
Who could afford to.

1338
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:02.680
LIAM: Brumstone?

1339
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.270
MATT: Brumstone is the the
bluish stone that's used

1340
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:09.375
in sky ships and is a mineral
that has the properties

1341
00:58:09.375 --> 00:58:11.603
that with a very basic, simple enchantment

1342
00:58:11.603 --> 00:58:14.670
that it's very susceptible to, causes it to lift.

1343
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:17.842
And there are a few cities that had enough of this

1344
00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:20.075
that they had hoarded and built within

1345
00:58:20.075 --> 00:58:23.810
that they're able to hold an entire city aloft.

1346
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:26.870
You know that supposedly one of these

1347
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.728
had crashed...

1348
00:58:29.728 --> 00:58:33.344
in Eiselcross to the north,

1349
00:58:33.344 --> 00:58:34.870
in the Biting North.

1350
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:39.508
And there are some elements

1351
00:58:39.508 --> 00:58:43.301
of the Empire outposts out there

1352
00:58:43.301 --> 00:58:46.632
that are currently excavating

1353
00:58:46.632 --> 00:58:49.206
what remnants they're able to

1354
00:58:49.206 --> 00:58:52.738
have access to of that fallen empire.

1355
00:58:52.738 --> 00:58:54.938
You would know it's referred to as Aeor.

1356
00:58:54.938 --> 00:58:56.596
A-E-O-R.

1357
00:58:57.954 --> 00:58:59.440
TRAVIS: (whispering) Do you want this?

1358
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.560
LIAM: Hm? I will later on.
TRAVIS: Okay.

1359
00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.972
LIAM: We have too much to do.

1360
00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:05.420
MATT: So I'd say between those two rolls,

1361
00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.308
the only place you can think of

1362
00:59:07.308 --> 00:59:08.772
that would probably have the materials

1363
00:59:08.772 --> 00:59:10.985
that were utilized to power this,

1364
00:59:10.985 --> 00:59:14.467
that's one location that you know

1365
00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:18.600
people have been able to scavenge and sell often.

1366
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.216
LIAM: Eiselcross.
MATT: Eiselcross.

1367
00:59:20.216 --> 00:59:21.481
LIAM: Okay.

1368
00:59:21.481 --> 00:59:22.981
Okay, thank you.

1369
00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:27.732
MATT: Cool.
LIAM: Done-zo.

1370
00:59:27.732 --> 00:59:29.245
MATT: Anybody else wanting to do anything?

1371
00:59:29.245 --> 00:59:32.230
TRAVIS: I would spend those two
nights changing my appearance,

1372
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:35.432
and just hitting up any
of the old haunts and bars

1373
00:59:35.432 --> 00:59:38.302
that I would visit in Nicodranas

1374
00:59:38.302 --> 00:59:41.123
when I was on the Tide's Breath, the old ship.

1375
00:59:41.123 --> 00:59:43.242
Just to see if there are any familiar faces

1376
00:59:43.242 --> 00:59:47.091
or particular persons of interest,

1377
00:59:47.091 --> 00:59:50.180
just as a sort of means of reminiscing.

1378
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.013
MATT: Okay.

1379
00:59:51.013 --> 00:59:54.483
TRAVIS: No active conversations,
but just more like

1380
00:59:54.483 --> 00:59:58.825
passive melancholy and revisiting.

1381
00:59:58.825 --> 01:00:00.667
MATT: Okay. Cool.

1382
01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:02.905
Make a perception check for me.

1383
01:00:02.905 --> 01:00:04.480
SAM: Come on, come on.

1384
01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.111
TRAVIS: 10.

1385
01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:09.479
MATT: 10?

1386
01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:13.753
Mmkay. The chaos around the wharf and the docks,

1387
01:00:13.753 --> 01:00:16.470
the Open Quay there.

1388
01:00:17.585 --> 01:00:20.497
It's pretty busy and you have a hard time

1389
01:00:20.497 --> 01:00:22.562
finding a comfortable location

1390
01:00:22.562 --> 01:00:23.702
within some of these old haunts.

1391
01:00:23.702 --> 01:00:26.657
They are pretty busy, given the fact that the entire town

1392
01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:28.645
is abuzz with people getting ready to travel,

1393
01:00:28.645 --> 01:00:29.611
many from out of town.

1394
01:00:29.611 --> 01:00:31.648
And so, while these are familiar old haunts to you,

1395
01:00:31.648 --> 01:00:35.620
for other people, there is a novelty to these spaces.

1396
01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.748
A lot of the individuals have
probably never been to Nicodranas,

1397
01:00:37.748 --> 01:00:42.562
and have just come south with the armada to be present,

1398
01:00:42.562 --> 01:00:46.034
to help defend this negotiation.

1399
01:00:46.034 --> 01:00:48.858
But you do manage to enjoy

1400
01:00:48.858 --> 01:00:51.232
thinking back to some of the old life,

1401
01:00:51.232 --> 01:00:53.388
reminiscing about some of the good and some of the bad.

1402
01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:57.120
And just contemplating on who you are now,

1403
01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.098
and what this current path has for you.

1404
01:01:00.098 --> 01:01:03.990
And throughout this entire venture,

1405
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:08.977
the one very visible structure that,

1406
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.182
growing up was just a lighthouse,

1407
01:01:12.182 --> 01:01:13.988
now has a much stronger significance as

1408
01:01:13.988 --> 01:01:18.689
it is the massive stone lighthouse carved

1409
01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:21.467
in the shape of the Wild Mother that overlooks the harbor.

1410
01:01:21.467 --> 01:01:25.565
TRAVIS: Right.
MATT: And what was once just a

1411
01:01:25.565 --> 01:01:29.553
a physical marker

1412
01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:33.747
to get around the southern side of the city

1413
01:01:33.747 --> 01:01:37.264
is now almost a welcoming beacon

1414
01:01:37.264 --> 01:01:40.075
to know exactly where you are and that

1415
01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:43.298
reminding you that you're always watched over.

1416
01:01:43.298 --> 01:01:44.881
TRAVIS: It's pretty cool.

1417
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:50.683
LAURA: I'm going to spend some time finishing up

1418
01:01:50.683 --> 01:01:53.683
and drawing some more of my tarot cards.

1419
01:01:56.191 --> 01:01:58.948
I've listed a few that I would like to make.

1420
01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.513
MATT: Okay.

1421
01:02:00.513 --> 01:02:04.443
LAURA: One I want to be The Jewel and The Thief,

1422
01:02:04.443 --> 01:02:05.665
which is going to be a card

1423
01:02:05.665 --> 01:02:09.623
with a big red ruby in the middle of it,

1424
01:02:09.623 --> 01:02:12.117
letting out a lot of light, but in the shadow of the card,

1425
01:02:12.117 --> 01:02:14.317
you can see there's actually a man behind it

1426
01:02:14.317 --> 01:02:16.762
reaching and trying to grab it for himself.

1427
01:02:16.762 --> 01:02:17.912
MATT: That's cool.

1428
01:02:18.863 --> 01:02:20.775
LAURA: The Spark and Blaze.

1429
01:02:20.775 --> 01:02:25.215
So from one side, it's small spark,
and the other side flipped over

1430
01:02:25.215 --> 01:02:27.262
you can see it's a flame that's consumed

1431
01:02:27.262 --> 01:02:29.312
the entire bottom of the card.

1432
01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:31.662
MATT: Okay, cool.

1433
01:02:31.662 --> 01:02:34.112
LAURA: Death and Dawn,

1434
01:02:34.112 --> 01:02:36.273
which will be a grave

1435
01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:39.223
with a sun coming from behind of it.

1436
01:02:40.277 --> 01:02:42.313
I think those are the ones I want to do right now.

1437
01:02:42.313 --> 01:02:43.213
MATT: Okay.

1438
01:02:43.213 --> 01:02:44.790
So you spend the time

1439
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.660
masterfully crafting and sketching

1440
01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.866
and painting out your new tarot cards.

1441
01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:52.750
LAURA: Yeah. Thank you.

1442
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:56.212
MATT: Fantastic. Anybody else have anything to do?

1443
01:02:56.212 --> 01:02:59.920
ASHLEY: Are there any fun activities to do at the Chateau,

1444
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.637
any shows or anything?

1445
01:03:01.637 --> 01:03:03.557
(laughter)

1446
01:03:03.557 --> 01:03:04.433
MARISHA: Sunday brunch.

1447
01:03:04.433 --> 01:03:05.276
ASHLEY: Sunday brunch.

1448
01:03:05.276 --> 01:03:08.359
TRAVIS: Ooh, brisket tacos!
MARISHA: Bottomless mimosas.

1449
01:03:12.118 --> 01:03:15.498
MATT: Marion is the central performer of the Chateau.

1450
01:03:15.498 --> 01:03:17.331
Aside from that, there

1451
01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:21.477
there's less performances more than there are occasional

1452
01:03:21.477 --> 01:03:23.915
games, mild gambling,

1453
01:03:23.915 --> 01:03:27.267
and in some cases, the occasional, like,

1454
01:03:27.267 --> 01:03:28.883
close-up magic performer might wander through

1455
01:03:28.883 --> 01:03:31.859
and earn a little bit of coin on the off days.

1456
01:03:33.405 --> 01:03:35.063
That's the Chateau specifically.

1457
01:03:35.063 --> 01:03:38.030
But throughout the city,
there are all manner of performances

1458
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:41.801
and there are musicians, and dancers, and

1459
01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:43.747
a whole number of artists of all different kinds

1460
01:03:43.747 --> 01:03:47.760
that go to the streets to busk and earn coin

1461
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.608
from those who are passing through,
from those that live nearby.

1462
01:03:50.608 --> 01:03:53.023
Some that this is where they reside and make their living,

1463
01:03:53.023 --> 01:03:55.608
others are just making their way
up and down the Menagerie Coast,

1464
01:03:55.608 --> 01:03:58.495
jumping from city state to city state,

1465
01:03:58.495 --> 01:04:02.491
doing best they can to make a splash and then leave before

1466
01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:07.118
the Zhelezo get any wind of maybe untoward activity.

1467
01:04:07.118 --> 01:04:09.330
But there's a lot of culture here.

1468
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:11.271
There's a reason that the city has its name,

1469
01:04:11.271 --> 01:04:14.619
and it's beautiful.

1470
01:04:14.619 --> 01:04:15.957
And I guess, for all the times you've been here,

1471
01:04:15.957 --> 01:04:19.224
it's nice to almost take a little bit of time for yourself,

1472
01:04:19.224 --> 01:04:21.847
just wander and experience.

1473
01:04:21.847 --> 01:04:26.431
And it's interesting to be a town
that is, you know, based in color

1474
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:30.418
and to be the monochromatic

1475
01:04:30.418 --> 01:04:32.597
stranger from the east,

1476
01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:37.354
but yet still smiling and enjoying it all.

1477
01:04:38.562 --> 01:04:40.108
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1478
01:04:40.108 --> 01:04:43.025
After walking through just alone,

1479
01:04:44.608 --> 01:04:48.495
I want to just go find a beach somewhere at night

1480
01:04:48.495 --> 01:04:51.109
and just go sit out by the water

1481
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:54.709
and play my bone harp and

1482
01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.761
just have a nice self care Sunday.

1483
01:05:00.761 --> 01:05:02.557
MATT: Okay!

1484
01:05:02.557 --> 01:05:04.375
I dig it.

1485
01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:05.698
All righty.

1486
01:05:05.698 --> 01:05:08.988
It's a beautiful night. The moon is only barely visible

1487
01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:11.802
across the horizon by the time you get out there.

1488
01:05:11.802 --> 01:05:14.979
There's a little bit of light dancing across the waves.

1489
01:05:14.979 --> 01:05:16.777
The stars are out above you,

1490
01:05:16.777 --> 01:05:19.812
and you're far enough away where you can see the distant

1491
01:05:19.812 --> 01:05:22.762
dotted glows of all the various points of lantern light

1492
01:05:22.762 --> 01:05:27.487
throughout the entire city, but you feel peaceful and alone,

1493
01:05:28.888 --> 01:05:31.627
comfortable, and in then that moment

1494
01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.426
content as you begin to

1495
01:05:33.426 --> 01:05:36.326
practice along your harp.

1496
01:05:37.735 --> 01:05:38.810
ASHLEY: Okay.

1497
01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:40.490
MATT: Anybody else?

1498
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:43.268
TALIESIN: I want to make a quick run to buy some

1499
01:05:43.268 --> 01:05:46.700
magical supplies for a few of my weirder spells

1500
01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.130
just so I have some options.

1501
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.775
MATT: Okay.

1502
01:05:49.775 --> 01:05:52.095
The two places that you had uncovered

1503
01:05:52.095 --> 01:05:54.833
as possible sources:

1504
01:05:54.833 --> 01:05:57.691
There is Meandering Treasures in the Restless Wharf,

1505
01:05:58.541 --> 01:06:03.183
or there is the Seafloor's Bounty in the Open Key-Kway.

1506
01:06:04.347 --> 01:06:05.876
TRAVIS: ♪ Key-Kway! ♪

1507
01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:06.800
SAM: Key-Kway?

1508
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.891
TALIESIN: I don't know. Which has the better vibe?

1509
01:06:09.891 --> 01:06:10.724
TRAVIS: Contigo.

1510
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.418
MATT: Meandering Treasures definitely seems to be the larger

1511
01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:16.470
and more prominent of the two.

1512
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.313
TALIESIN: I'll support a small business;
I'll go to the other one.

1513
01:06:18.313 --> 01:06:19.146
MATT: Okay.

1514
01:06:19.146 --> 01:06:21.633
(laughter)

1515
01:06:22.808 --> 01:06:25.016
TALIESIN: Grabbing some incense, stuff like that,

1516
01:06:25.016 --> 01:06:27.157
couple hundred gold worth.
MATT: No worries.

1517
01:06:27.157 --> 01:06:29.407
So you enter the Seafloor's Bounty.

1518
01:06:29.407 --> 01:06:33.250
It seems to be a general store of kinds,

1519
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.662
but it specializes in pawning items and scavenged loot

1520
01:06:36.662 --> 01:06:38.560
and things that a lot of travelers come through

1521
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.022
and want to offload, whether legal or not.

1522
01:06:42.022 --> 01:06:44.550
The exterior itself looks similar to many

1523
01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:46.306
of the other base wooden buildings,

1524
01:06:46.306 --> 01:06:48.898
but it's been heavily decorated with

1525
01:06:48.898 --> 01:06:51.339
dry, rotten nets that have been pulled across

1526
01:06:51.339 --> 01:06:52.918
the corners of it with all sorts of, like,

1527
01:06:52.918 --> 01:06:55.207
hanging glass bottles.

1528
01:06:55.207 --> 01:06:58.789
You can see, outside, against the the walls,

1529
01:06:58.789 --> 01:07:01.832
there are strips of leather that are currently being tanned.

1530
01:07:02.983 --> 01:07:06.233
There is a gathered group of

1531
01:07:06.233 --> 01:07:09.824
five different colorful tropical birds

1532
01:07:09.824 --> 01:07:11.899
that aren't in cages,

1533
01:07:11.899 --> 01:07:14.262
but they're staying on perches outside and as you approach,

1534
01:07:14.262 --> 01:07:17.240
they begin to make noise, like, (bird chittering)

1535
01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.672
this garbled bird noise as you approach

1536
01:07:19.672 --> 01:07:21.216
and just look over towards you.

1537
01:07:21.216 --> 01:07:23.799
TALIESIN: Hey. Everything going all right?

1538
01:07:23.799 --> 01:07:25.388
Doing okay?

1539
01:07:25.388 --> 01:07:27.337
MATT: (bird fluttering) (clicking)

1540
01:07:27.337 --> 01:07:28.717
TALIESIN: That's nice. That's good.

1541
01:07:28.717 --> 01:07:29.983
Hold on, I've got--

1542
01:07:29.983 --> 01:07:32.288
I pull out whatever the hell was growing in my pouch.

1543
01:07:32.288 --> 01:07:33.812
TRAVIS: Lichen.

1544
01:07:33.812 --> 01:07:36.795
TALIESIN: Yeah, have something--
This is different, it's from far away.

1545
01:07:36.795 --> 01:07:37.628
Yeah.

1546
01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:41.803
I mean, come on, you either want any don't.

1547
01:07:41.803 --> 01:07:45.270
MATT: (fluttering) Lands on your arm and just eats out of your finger.

1548
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:46.111
TALIESIN: I figured.

1549
01:07:46.111 --> 01:07:48.419
MATT: Shits on your arm, goes back to its perch.

1550
01:07:48.419 --> 01:07:49.953
TALIESIN: I don't clean it off. Okay.

1551
01:07:49.953 --> 01:07:50.995
LAURA: Ew!

1552
01:07:50.995 --> 01:07:51.842
TRAVIS: Radagast.
MATT: Come on, Radagast.

1553
01:07:51.842 --> 01:07:52.762
TRAVIS: Radagast.

1554
01:07:52.762 --> 01:07:53.595
TALIESIN: You're very welcome.

1555
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.328
MATT: So yeah. So you enter the interior.

1556
01:07:56.328 --> 01:07:59.178
It smells so strong

1557
01:07:59.178 --> 01:08:03.042
of medicinal herb and fish.

1558
01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:05.730
Just the combination of the two is this odd,

1559
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:08.807
somewhat pungent to most people, but to you,

1560
01:08:08.807 --> 01:08:11.280
I wouldn't say it would bother you too much.

1561
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.395
The inside, however, is pleasantly decorated.

1562
01:08:14.395 --> 01:08:16.922
There are all manner of, like, small pots that contain

1563
01:08:16.922 --> 01:08:21.922
segmented gardens and a lot of displaced

1564
01:08:22.123 --> 01:08:22.956
herbalism.

1565
01:08:25.314 --> 01:08:26.980
Spec-- it's kind of like--

1566
01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.365
Specifically built herb gardens
that are dotting in the interior

1567
01:08:30.365 --> 01:08:31.735
at different heights and different shelves

1568
01:08:31.735 --> 01:08:35.243
that give part of the aroma that you encountered,

1569
01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:37.427
and are probably, over time, part of what's harvested

1570
01:08:37.427 --> 01:08:38.615
and utilized in different balms

1571
01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.070
and salves and stuff that are sold here.

1572
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:43.233
You can see they are clusters

1573
01:08:43.233 --> 01:08:44.532
of fishing gear on one wall.

1574
01:08:44.532 --> 01:08:48.582
You can see some long spears and fishing spears.

1575
01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:51.210
You can see there's a,

1576
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:53.788
like, a flintlock pistol

1577
01:08:53.788 --> 01:08:55.478
on one wall in the back.

1578
01:08:55.478 --> 01:08:58.908
You can see there's one table that contains

1579
01:08:58.908 --> 01:09:01.441
what looks like a bunch of

1580
01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:08.770
tools and other odd objects that have just enough rust

1581
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.868
and barnacles on them that you assume they were probably

1582
01:09:11.868 --> 01:09:15.080
pulled from the sea floor and then sold here.

1583
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.461
It's an eclectic interior.

1584
01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:19.763
You do see the one person who runs this place

1585
01:09:19.763 --> 01:09:23.122
is a older female gnome.

1586
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:28.098
Has this very deep-set smile lines on her face

1587
01:09:28.098 --> 01:09:30.288
and these crow's feet that almost cause--

1588
01:09:30.288 --> 01:09:33.013
the lid seems to almost completely cover

1589
01:09:33.013 --> 01:09:35.287
the eyes, except for a little bit of beady black

1590
01:09:35.287 --> 01:09:40.287
that pokes through. Very, very suntanned skin.

1591
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:42.495
You can see it's been burned in places over and over again

1592
01:09:42.495 --> 01:09:44.448
to the point where it gives you this very, like,

1593
01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:48.200
splotchy complexion that's strangely adorable.

1594
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.866
Her hair is sun bleached

1595
01:09:49.866 --> 01:09:52.895
to where you can see the gray and light brown beneath,

1596
01:09:52.895 --> 01:09:56.004
but the entirety of the main surface itself is practically

1597
01:09:56.004 --> 01:09:59.430
white and blonde from sun bleaching.

1598
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:01.695
As soon as you, like, look around and then notice

1599
01:10:01.695 --> 01:10:03.711
she's just sitting there their hands covered and goes,

1600
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:04.778
"Hi!"

1601
01:10:04.778 --> 01:10:05.843
TALIESIN: Hey, hi.

1602
01:10:05.843 --> 01:10:07.593
MATT: "How can I help you?"

1603
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:09.760
TALIESIN: I'm Caduceus.

1604
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.890
I don't know if we've had the pleasure.

1605
01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:13.448
MATT: "I'm Sheila Bobsnopper."

1606
01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:14.785
TALIESIN: It's a pleasure.

1607
01:10:14.785 --> 01:10:16.951
MATT: "And welcome to my establishment."
MARISHA and LAURA: Bobsnopper?

1608
01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.292
LAURA: I love it!

1609
01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:20.920
TALIESIN: I was hoping just to pick up some some sundries.

1610
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.348
I'm looking for some incense, a little bit of

1611
01:10:24.348 --> 01:10:25.648
I can't remember the name of it,

1612
01:10:25.648 --> 01:10:30.648
but that's saffron fat ointment that is used to make

1613
01:10:30.765 --> 01:10:33.747
True Seeing tinctures.

1614
01:10:33.747 --> 01:10:35.420
I do a little bit of my own,

1615
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.514
but I could use a little bit of that.

1616
01:10:36.514 --> 01:10:39.227
MATT: "Let's have a look and see what we can do for you.

1617
01:10:39.227 --> 01:10:40.493
"Come on, come on."

1618
01:10:40.493 --> 01:10:43.635
She hops off her stool and scuttles over to you.

1619
01:10:43.635 --> 01:10:47.000
Yeah, those materials, you can purchase what's necessary.

1620
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.802
TALIESIN: 100 each. And then, if you've got
anything else interesting,

1621
01:10:49.802 --> 01:10:51.667
I'm always a collector of odds and ends,

1622
01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:53.475
and just for fun, I'm going to cast Detect Magic

1623
01:10:53.475 --> 01:10:55.982
in the room and see what I see. If anything's shiny.

1624
01:10:55.982 --> 01:10:56.932
MATT: Okay.

1625
01:10:56.932 --> 01:10:58.363
You--

1626
01:10:58.363 --> 01:10:59.196
(chuckles)

1627
01:11:00.452 --> 01:11:01.968
there are

1628
01:11:03.615 --> 01:11:06.290
three things that catch your attention.

1629
01:11:10.272 --> 01:11:14.070
You see on one wall, there is what looks to be a leather fan

1630
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.893
of some kind that is just set on the edge.

1631
01:11:16.893 --> 01:11:20.268
It's about maybe this long and it's sprawled out open-wards.

1632
01:11:20.268 --> 01:11:22.781
Looks like a hand fan, but it's
a little larger than the ones

1633
01:11:22.781 --> 01:11:27.211
you've seen used as part of like, delicate social,

1634
01:11:27.211 --> 01:11:30.620
presentational type of design. It has a beautiful design

1635
01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.282
on the front that looks like a continuously curled series

1636
01:11:34.282 --> 01:11:37.110
of lines, like snakes or serpents
that are winding around each other

1637
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.858
but without a head. It's just these long,

1638
01:11:39.858 --> 01:11:43.967
coiling lines, gray and they fade at the tips,

1639
01:11:45.115 --> 01:11:47.910
tangled and weirdly beautiful, like, very watercolor-esque.

1640
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:50.557
But that definitely gives a glow.

1641
01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:53.824
There is a case

1642
01:11:53.824 --> 01:11:56.336
that you see that gives a faint magical aura from the inside

1643
01:11:56.336 --> 01:11:59.383
of it. You can just barely sense from the interior.

1644
01:11:59.383 --> 01:12:03.605
It has a heavy, like, bronze lock on the outside that looks

1645
01:12:03.605 --> 01:12:06.688
very, very intricately carved and detailed.

1646
01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:10.112
And there is, what looks to be,

1647
01:12:11.402 --> 01:12:14.657
a leather strap around her neck

1648
01:12:14.657 --> 01:12:18.547
that has a bundle of dried herbs

1649
01:12:18.547 --> 01:12:20.650
or roots that are bound

1650
01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:25.602
and held to this choker-like necklace.

1651
01:12:25.602 --> 01:12:27.435
TALIESIN: I'm going to ask in order.

1652
01:12:27.435 --> 01:12:30.788
The fan's interesting.
What do you know about that?

1653
01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:33.857
MATT: "Well, you see, that that was sold to me

1654
01:12:33.857 --> 01:12:37.491
"not but seven or eight months ago by

1655
01:12:38.678 --> 01:12:41.425
"Gerald Kingsman. He's a fisherman that

1656
01:12:41.425 --> 01:12:43.522
"comes over here from Brokenbank occasionally

1657
01:12:43.522 --> 01:12:47.547
"and provides all sorts of strange findings

1658
01:12:47.547 --> 01:12:49.937
"and hasn't had any takers yet,

1659
01:12:49.937 --> 01:12:51.386
"but from what he tells me,

1660
01:12:51.386 --> 01:12:53.595
"(whispers) it's got some magic in it."

1661
01:12:53.595 --> 01:12:55.595
TALIESIN: Well, that's exciting.

1662
01:12:56.715 --> 01:12:58.380
I'd be curious what you-- well,

1663
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.158
I'm going to ask about a couple more things,

1664
01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:01.541
but I would be curious about how much

1665
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:03.583
you'd willing to--
MATT: "I can show you, if you want."

1666
01:13:03.583 --> 01:13:05.603
TALIESIN: I mean, if you know what it does, sure.

1667
01:13:05.603 --> 01:13:07.518
MATT: She takes it off the wall, and goes,

1668
01:13:07.518 --> 01:13:09.268
"Let's step outside."

1669
01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:15.690
You step outside into the the warm daylight. She goes,

1670
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:18.435
"Now watch that barrel,"

1671
01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:19.897
and she points to a barrel across the street about,

1672
01:13:19.897 --> 01:13:24.679
like, 40 or so feet away from you. She opens the fan, goes.

1673
01:13:24.679 --> 01:13:25.967
(exhale)

1674
01:13:25.967 --> 01:13:28.174
And suddenly,
(heavy wind gust)

1675
01:13:28.174 --> 01:13:32.373
this wind gust just bursts from it, slams into the barrel,

1676
01:13:32.373 --> 01:13:33.656
and you watch it suddenly go

1677
01:13:33.656 --> 01:13:34.631
(rolling)

1678
01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:36.514
and then roll, and roll, and roll, and roll

1679
01:13:36.514 --> 01:13:38.028
before it comes to a stop.
TALIESIN: (guffaws)

1680
01:13:38.028 --> 01:13:40.032
MATT: She closes it, snaps it shut.

1681
01:13:40.032 --> 01:13:41.623
TALIESIN: Oh wow, that's pretty cool.

1682
01:13:41.623 --> 01:13:42.575
MATT: "200 gold."

1683
01:13:42.575 --> 01:13:44.675
TALIESIN: 200 gold. Well, all right.

1684
01:13:45.863 --> 01:13:48.324
Other questions, that's pretty cool.

1685
01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:51.148
That's-- wow. Wow.

1686
01:13:51.148 --> 01:13:53.770
Is it just barrels, or does it do other stuff, too?

1687
01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:55.352
MATT: "I haven't tried."

1688
01:13:55.352 --> 01:13:58.722
TALIESIN: Wow. Barrels alone are pretty exciting.

1689
01:13:58.722 --> 01:14:00.330
Does it work on people?

1690
01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:01.698
MATT: "I haven't tried."

1691
01:14:01.698 --> 01:14:03.264
TALIESIN: Do you want to?

1692
01:14:03.264 --> 01:14:05.456
MATT: "Only if you buy it."

1693
01:14:07.497 --> 01:14:08.330
TALIESIN: We'll talk.

1694
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:09.934
MATT: "Okay."

1695
01:14:09.934 --> 01:14:12.748
TALIESIN: Then I pick up the case.

1696
01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:14.147
This is exciting.

1697
01:14:14.147 --> 01:14:17.578
MATT: "Now that's the mystery case.

1698
01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:20.425
"Meaning I haven't been able to get it open."

1699
01:14:20.425 --> 01:14:22.222
(laughter)

1700
01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:25.492
"So I don't know what's inside.

1701
01:14:25.492 --> 01:14:28.575
"But I'll sell it to you for 500 gold.

1702
01:14:29.835 --> 01:14:32.755
"Who knows, it could be ashes.

1703
01:14:32.755 --> 01:14:36.539
"It could be the lost jewels of an ancient ruler."

1704
01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:37.958
TALIESIN: Either way, that's pretty exciting,

1705
01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:38.791
MATT: "Isn't it?"

1706
01:14:38.791 --> 01:14:39.843
TALIESIN: Yeah,
MATT: "Isn't it?"

1707
01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:43.921
TALIESIN: Wow, I mean, yeah,
they're both pretty good. Oh, man.

1708
01:14:43.921 --> 01:14:44.754
MARISHA: -- grab bag.

1709
01:14:44.754 --> 01:14:47.338
TALIESIN: And, not that it's for sale, but I was curious,

1710
01:14:47.338 --> 01:14:49.320
that's such an interesting thing you're wearing.

1711
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.485
I assume it's not for sale.

1712
01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:53.360
I was just sort of curious about it, though.

1713
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:59.420
MATT: "This helps me maintain a lot of my gardens

1714
01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:02.573
"in here. It allows me to converse

1715
01:15:02.573 --> 01:15:07.160
"with the creatures that grow from the earth.

1716
01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.870
"See what they need, when they need them."

1717
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:10.405
TALIESIN: Oh, I can already do that stuff.

1718
01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:14.099
MATT: "They talk back and tell me what they require."

1719
01:15:14.099 --> 01:15:15.157
TALIESIN: Hmm.

1720
01:15:17.582 --> 01:15:19.638
I don't suppose you'd be interested in parting

1721
01:15:19.638 --> 01:15:21.423
with that by any chance?

1722
01:15:21.423 --> 01:15:24.281
MATT: "(skeptical noise)"
TALIESIN: Or making another one.

1723
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:27.700
I understand if like--

1724
01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.140
MATT: "What's your offer?"

1725
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.057
TALIESIN: Oh man, I don't know.

1726
01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.763
You got so much fun stuff.

1727
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:39.286
You want 500 gold for the box.

1728
01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:41.512
200 gold for the fan.

1729
01:15:41.512 --> 01:15:42.678
MATT: "Yeah."

1730
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:50.960
TALIESIN: How about 900 gold for the whole kit and caboodle?

1731
01:15:52.132 --> 01:15:53.507
MATT: "Hmm.

1732
01:15:58.795 --> 01:16:00.962
"'Cause I like your hair..."

1733
01:16:02.633 --> 01:16:04.900
Go ahead and make a persuasion check.

1734
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.733
LAURA: Can you Guide yourself?
TRAVIS: That's a fair offer.

1735
01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.906
TALIESIN: I'm not going to Guide myself.

1736
01:16:09.906 --> 01:16:11.314
Because I don't want to...

1737
01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:15.310
Actually, I'll do something-- before I do this.

1738
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:16.570
You like the hair?

1739
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:17.403
MATT: "I do."

1740
01:16:17.403 --> 01:16:19.258
TALIESIN: I can sweeten the deal a little bit

1741
01:16:19.258 --> 01:16:22.180
and I remove some of the pink phosphorescent mold

1742
01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:25.330
that's growing on me that's part of the stuff that makes

1743
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:30.193
the hair go and I'll just place some of it on the counter.

1744
01:16:30.193 --> 01:16:32.282
You can see if you can get it going.

1745
01:16:32.282 --> 01:16:34.407
This is not natural.

1746
01:16:34.407 --> 01:16:37.680
This is a choice. This is something I do.

1747
01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.255
MATT: Go ahead and roll your persuasion check.

1748
01:16:39.255 --> 01:16:40.496
TALIESIN: All right.

1749
01:16:41.724 --> 01:16:42.724
TRAVIS: Come on, baby.

1750
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.259
TALIESIN: 12.

1751
01:16:45.259 --> 01:16:48.931
MATT: 12? Well, the DC did decrease when you offered

1752
01:16:48.931 --> 01:16:51.075
the lichen, so that helped.

1753
01:16:51.075 --> 01:16:55.880
She goes, "The pile of pink stuff,

1754
01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.059
"900 gold, and you have yourself a deal.

1755
01:16:58.059 --> 01:16:59.836
"(spits)"
TALIESIN: (spits)

1756
01:16:59.836 --> 01:17:02.111
(cheering)

1757
01:17:02.111 --> 01:17:04.492
TRAVIS: We bought magic shit! You did.

1758
01:17:04.492 --> 01:17:08.100
TALIESIN: Can't wait to come back
again. This place is so nice

1759
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.040
MATT: "Any time. Maybe wait a few weeks."

1760
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.682
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to be gone for a while.

1761
01:17:12.682 --> 01:17:13.640
Don't worry about it.

1762
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.601
MATT: "No worries. Any time."

1763
01:17:15.601 --> 01:17:17.320
TALIESIN: And you buy, too? Out of curiosity.

1764
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.153
MATT: "Oh! Always."

1765
01:17:18.153 --> 01:17:20.280
TALIESIN: If I see something fun, I'll bring it by.

1766
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.263
MATT: "Please do. Always looking to collect

1767
01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:24.171
"and find new owners for them."

1768
01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:25.554
TALIESIN: Pleasure.

1769
01:17:25.554 --> 01:17:26.695
MATT: So yeah, you have--

1770
01:17:26.695 --> 01:17:29.128
TALIESIN: Let me knock 900 gold off my--

1771
01:17:29.128 --> 01:17:30.003
SAM: That's a lot of--

1772
01:17:30.003 --> 01:17:31.428
TALIESIN: That's what gold-- oh, he don't care!

1773
01:17:31.428 --> 01:17:32.819
ASHLEY: We should go sell those bracers--

1774
01:17:32.819 --> 01:17:34.768
MATT: So here you go.
ASHLEY: --that we don't need.

1775
01:17:34.768 --> 01:17:35.834
TALIESIN: Woo!

1776
01:17:37.037 --> 01:17:38.487
All right, let's see.

1777
01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.168
Okay.

1778
01:17:42.168 --> 01:17:44.577
TRAVIS: It's just the two, right,
because you can't open the box yet?

1779
01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.819
MATT: Yeah, haven't opened the box.

1780
01:17:45.819 --> 01:17:47.215
TALIESIN: Can't open the box yet? Yeah.

1781
01:17:47.215 --> 01:17:48.712
ASHLEY: What's in the box?

1782
01:17:48.712 --> 01:17:49.545
TALIESIN: Oh man.
LAURA: What if it's empty?

1783
01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:50.378
You wouldn't do that.

1784
01:17:50.378 --> 01:17:52.545
Would you do that? You would do that.

1785
01:17:52.545 --> 01:17:54.770
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?
SAM: Mercer would do anything.

1786
01:17:55.856 --> 01:17:59.062
TALIESIN: Oh man, so this makes
it so they can talk back, then?

1787
01:17:59.062 --> 01:18:01.214
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. That's pretty cool.

1788
01:18:01.214 --> 01:18:03.070
And then I've got the weird box.

1789
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.398
Okay, and where's my equipment?

1790
01:18:05.398 --> 01:18:07.962
Let me knock 900 bucks off this.

1791
01:18:07.962 --> 01:18:09.370
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Worth it.

1792
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:12.223
MATT: Fantastic.

1793
01:18:12.223 --> 01:18:14.218
TALIESIN: I skip back home.

1794
01:18:15.152 --> 01:18:16.419
Magic beans!

1795
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.710
MATT: Anything else?

1796
01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:24.710
MARISHA: I-- Ashley read my mind. Beau is going to take a

1797
01:18:25.153 --> 01:18:27.992
bed roll and some food and shove it in a bag

1798
01:18:27.992 --> 01:18:30.617
and she's going to go walk up the coast a little bit, find

1799
01:18:30.617 --> 01:18:34.567
a spot, and just camp overnight for the rest of her time.

1800
01:18:34.567 --> 01:18:35.492
MATT: Okay.

1801
01:18:35.492 --> 01:18:37.107
MARISHA: Have some alone time.

1802
01:18:37.107 --> 01:18:38.148
MATT: You got it.

1803
01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:39.880
On the last night before the armada leaves,

1804
01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:43.122
you're out there camping and you do hear the soft sound

1805
01:18:43.122 --> 01:18:45.967
of-- well, roll a performance check.

1806
01:18:45.967 --> 01:18:48.642
(chuckling)
LAURA: Aww.

1807
01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:54.141
(scatting, bass plucking noises)

1808
01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:56.787
ASHLEY: Performance is minus two.

1809
01:18:58.290 --> 01:18:59.160
10

1810
01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.800
MATT: 10.

1811
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.791
You hear...

1812
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.437
what at times falters, but is mostly a pleasant

1813
01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:08.236
sound of a harp.

1814
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.940
MARISHA: Can I see where it's coming from?

1815
01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.800
MATT: I'd say with your perception,
your passive perception, yeah.

1816
01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.105
So you lean forward. You can glance

1817
01:19:17.105 --> 01:19:19.277
and just-- I mean, a way's off,

1818
01:19:19.277 --> 01:19:22.756
but you see a figure sitting just where the horizon

1819
01:19:22.756 --> 01:19:24.630
and the ocean meets, what looks to be a bit of a sand dune

1820
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:26.323
there along the beach.

1821
01:19:26.323 --> 01:19:28.040
TRAVIS: (wave crashing)
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah!

1822
01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:32.005
I just nod and smile.

1823
01:19:33.882 --> 01:19:35.493
Watch from a distance.

1824
01:19:35.493 --> 01:19:36.885
MATT: Cool.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1825
01:19:36.885 --> 01:19:38.851
MATT: All righty.
ASHLEY: ♪ From a distance. ♪

1826
01:19:38.851 --> 01:19:41.573
(laughter)

1827
01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:45.045
MATT: So the morning is eminent.
As you come to consciousness

1828
01:19:45.045 --> 01:19:47.732
and begin to prepare yourselves for the day, the energy

1829
01:19:47.732 --> 01:19:50.395
is palpable across the city.

1830
01:19:50.395 --> 01:19:52.955
You see countless Righteous Brand soldiers

1831
01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:55.790
and Shore Wardens being aided by Zhelezo

1832
01:19:55.790 --> 01:20:00.051
in bringing final materials towards the harbor.

1833
01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:03.228
You can see that most ships are now out there and arranged

1834
01:20:03.228 --> 01:20:06.333
and ready to leave. The last few stragglers are being loaded

1835
01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:09.815
up. You can see the final conversations are happening

1836
01:20:09.815 --> 01:20:12.303
between the local lords and ladies

1837
01:20:12.303 --> 01:20:17.160
and those that will be leading as part of this journey.

1838
01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.344
It's going to happen soon, so
what would you guys like to do?

1839
01:20:20.344 --> 01:20:22.597
SAM: As we wake up, I'm going to grab my husband,

1840
01:20:22.597 --> 01:20:26.140
just have a private moment to be like:

1841
01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:29.081
Hey, Yeza, let's talk.

1842
01:20:29.081 --> 01:20:30.596
MATT: "Of course, of course, yeah."
SAM: Real quick.

1843
01:20:30.596 --> 01:20:33.096
So I'm back now. I'm me.

1844
01:20:35.514 --> 01:20:38.325
We're a family again. It's pretty cool.

1845
01:20:38.325 --> 01:20:40.403
MATT: "It's pretty great, I'm not going to lie."

1846
01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:44.840
SAM: Yeah, but also, you've been living here

1847
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:49.840
in this weird temporary space that is not our home.

1848
01:20:50.087 --> 01:20:53.773
And at some point Luc will have to start school and

1849
01:20:53.773 --> 01:20:55.306
what are we doing?

1850
01:20:55.306 --> 01:20:57.593
MATT: "I've been thinking about that. I don't know how long

1851
01:20:57.593 --> 01:21:01.068
"this is going to take. I'm not going to lie,

1852
01:21:02.128 --> 01:21:03.903
"living most of my life in Felderwin,

1853
01:21:03.903 --> 01:21:05.900
"you know, I was content.

1854
01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.370
"It's really nice here."

1855
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:08.500
SAM: Oh?

1856
01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.966
MATT: "Well, yeah, they have-- there's the ocean."

1857
01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:11.932
SAM: Ugh.

1858
01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:14.700
MATT: "Right.

1859
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.110
"Luc likes the ocean."

1860
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:18.737
SAM: Okay, no, that's okay.

1861
01:21:18.737 --> 01:21:21.480
MATT: "I don't know. The culture here, the people,

1862
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:24.140
"it's a very different experience,

1863
01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:28.410
"and I'm rather enjoying the change of pace, so

1864
01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:31.407
"don't feel like it's a burden
on either of us, necessarily."

1865
01:21:31.407 --> 01:21:32.948
SAM: Well, I know, but don't you think

1866
01:21:32.948 --> 01:21:36.750
we should get some sort of a permanent home?

1867
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.117
If you like it here-- I like it here, too.

1868
01:21:39.117 --> 01:21:40.920
MATT: "I'm not saying we need to stay here forever,

1869
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.984
"but I'm just saying, don't feel
like it's been a burden either.

1870
01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:45.916
"I mean, our home's in Felderwin,

1871
01:21:46.873 --> 01:21:48.320
"what remains of it, I suppose.

1872
01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:50.828
"But--

1873
01:21:52.677 --> 01:21:56.043
"yeah, I like it here for now.

1874
01:21:57.867 --> 01:22:00.837
"I am considering finding a tutor for Luc."

1875
01:22:00.837 --> 01:22:02.598
SAM: Okay. Well--

1876
01:22:02.598 --> 01:22:05.292
MATT: "Mainly 'cause it's important for him to--

1877
01:22:05.292 --> 01:22:07.587
"he's getting to that age now where I think he can start

1878
01:22:07.587 --> 01:22:11.445
"learning more than shooting that crossbow."

1879
01:22:11.445 --> 01:22:13.613
SAM: Yes, no, he has to have

1880
01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:19.242
education in other aspects of his life

1881
01:22:19.242 --> 01:22:20.717
other than physical.

1882
01:22:22.918 --> 01:22:24.138
We should definitely do that.

1883
01:22:24.138 --> 01:22:26.637
In fact, maybe Marion knows some tutors,

1884
01:22:26.637 --> 01:22:29.420
the ones that helped raise Jester.

1885
01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:30.405
MATT: "That's true.

1886
01:22:30.405 --> 01:22:33.018
"That's very true. I'll go ahead and ask her.

1887
01:22:33.018 --> 01:22:34.920
"I think I'm going to ask her."

1888
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.711
SAM: Okay, but like,

1889
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:41.238
I don't know-- do we have a plan?

1890
01:22:41.238 --> 01:22:44.480
Should we go back to Felderwin at some point

1891
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.920
and, you know, just be a family?

1892
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.078
MATT: "I mean,

1893
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.113
"I'd like to, eventually."

1894
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.273
SAM: Well, I don't want you guys to just be sitting

1895
01:22:54.273 --> 01:22:56.840
in limbo here waiting for me.

1896
01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.288
MATT: "We're not sitting in limbo, necessarily.

1897
01:22:59.288 --> 01:23:01.730
"Like I said, this has been an interesting change of pace.

1898
01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:03.278
"I think it's a great opportunity for Luc

"of all different walks of life and

1901

"get away from the very-- frankly, insular experience

1902
01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.222
"that Felderwin is a lot of the time.

1903
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:22.479
"And you're doing some pretty big things.

1904
01:23:24.197 --> 01:23:27.355
"The last thing I want to do is to get in the way of that."

1905
01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:31.693
SAM: It's true, I mean, my friends are counting

1906
01:23:31.693 --> 01:23:35.835
on me to help them. We have a pretty important

1907
01:23:35.835 --> 01:23:39.810
thing coming up. I would hate to abandon them right now,

1908
01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:43.220
but I can't keep doing this forever

1909
01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:47.000
and leaving you guys after two days, three days.

1910
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.293
It's not fair to you.

1911
01:23:48.293 --> 01:23:50.770
MATT: "We're not going to do it forever, right?"

1912
01:23:51.761 --> 01:23:53.361
SAM: No, you're right.
MATT: "Right?"

1913
01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.777
SAM: No, you're right. I'm not going to do it forever.

1914
01:23:55.777 --> 01:23:58.250
MATT: "Look what they did: they brought you back."

1915
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:59.083
SAM: They did.

1916
01:23:59.083 --> 01:24:01.360
MATT: "They saved-- you all

1917
01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.052
"saved me from a very terrible experience.

1918
01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.830

"I don't think I can ever find the words to express it,

"as she does, then what else could I ask for?"

01:24:32.970 --> 01:24:35.403
SAM: You are, like, the greatest husband ever,

1926
01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.420
by the way, can I just say?

1927
01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:38.403
MATT: "Well,

1928
01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:43.420

"as it is while we're here.

"And...

1934
01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.360
"I kind of like not being under the thumb of some

"odd Assembly woman, so I'm okay with this."

1936
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:10.955
SAM: Okay.

1937
01:25:11.897 --> 01:25:13.322
MATT: "For now."

1938
01:25:13.322 --> 01:25:15.471
SAM: I'll leave you enough money

1939
01:25:15.471 --> 01:25:17.730
that if it feels weird that you're

1940
01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:21.080
in this hotel place, that if you want to get an apartment

1941
01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.180
or something, you can. You should.

1942
01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:27.590
Or if you like being here, that's fine, too.

1943
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:30.515
MATT: "How much is real estate out here in Nicodranas?"

1944
01:25:30.515 --> 01:25:33.272
SAM: I passed an office last night.

1945
01:25:33.272 --> 01:25:36.837
They had all these pictures of like, "you can live here!"

1946
01:25:37.786 --> 01:25:39.753
You know, they had some condos.

1947
01:25:39.753 --> 01:25:40.586
MATT: "Oh, oh."

1948
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:43.607
SAM: Timeshare, there was a timeshare.

1949
01:25:43.607 --> 01:25:46.020
MATT: "I've heard someone mention 'timeshare.'"

1950
01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.200
SAM: Yeah, I don't quite know how it works, but--

1951
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.966
MATT: "They had free food, it was great."

1952
01:25:49.966 --> 01:25:52.399
SAM: Oh yeah, did you--

1953
01:25:52.399 --> 01:25:54.060
MATT: "For a very long time."

1954
01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:57.592
SAM: Yeah, I mean, free food, though.

1955
01:25:58.708 --> 01:26:01.950
Well, if you see anything,

1956
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:06.720
you know, just let me know, because I've been collecting

1957
01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.953
quite a bit of money.

1958
01:26:10.187 --> 01:26:14.340
MATT: "Well, if you need somewhere to keep it, I can

1959
01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.280
"act as the accountant, I guess, in this arrangement."

1960
01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.690
SAM: Yeah, of course, of course.

1961
01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:21.874
Here, I'll leave you--

1962
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:26.730
I'll leave you 100 platinum.

1963
01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:28.346
MATT: You give it to him, he goes,

1964
01:26:30.515 --> 01:26:32.040
"Veth. Uh..."

1965
01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.789
SAM: Well, you know, I shouldn't be carrying this with me.

1966
01:26:33.789 --> 01:26:35.640
What if I lose it or something?

1967
01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.264
MATT: "What if I lose it?!"

1968
01:26:38.181 --> 01:26:39.489
He quickly puts it in his pockets.

1969
01:26:39.489 --> 01:26:41.256
"I have-- wow.

1970
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:45.202
"Yeah, go with your friends!"

1971
01:26:45.202 --> 01:26:49.472
SAM: I mean, it's crazy. We make a lot of money.

1972
01:26:49.472 --> 01:26:53.239
MATT: "I think I could probably find a place, yeah. Wow.

1973
01:26:55.742 --> 01:26:58.210
"Okay, yeah, no, I'll get on that."

1974
01:26:58.210 --> 01:26:59.060
SAM: Or not.

1975
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:03.302
MATT: "But like, as incredible as this is,

1976
01:27:06.172 --> 01:27:10.430
"don't get yourself in any
situations that are too dangerous."

1977
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:12.012
SAM: Hoo.

1978
01:27:12.896 --> 01:27:14.596
Ah...

1979
01:27:15.723 --> 01:27:17.567
You know what?

1980
01:27:17.567 --> 01:27:20.523
I can't promise that,

1981
01:27:20.523 --> 01:27:24.420
but I can promise you that that my friends will

1982
01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:26.686
do their best to protect me.

1983
01:27:26.686 --> 01:27:27.744
MATT: "Okay.

1984
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:35.244
"There are a lot of tales of heroic sacrifices,

1985
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:42.070
"and poems spoken by different bards and storytellers

1986
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:46.445
"of these people who stood up to these great challenges

1987
01:27:46.445 --> 01:27:50.147
"and gave themselves for a better tomorrow.

1988
01:27:50.147 --> 01:27:51.797
"You're extremely brave.

1989
01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:57.611
"I want my wife. I don't want a poem."

1990
01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:00.513
SAM: Yeah.

1991
01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.437
I promise I'll be more than just a story.

1992
01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:09.420
MATT: "Okay."
SAM: I'll come back.

1993
01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.253
MATT: "Okay."

1994
01:28:10.253 --> 01:28:14.094
SAM: And this will end at some point,

1995
01:28:14.094 --> 01:28:16.302
and we'll go to Felderwin.

1996
01:28:16.302 --> 01:28:18.935
We'll have a summer place here

1997
01:28:18.935 --> 01:28:21.620
and a winter place there.

1998
01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:25.883
We'll be-- not bicoastal, but you know.

1999
01:28:27.483 --> 01:28:28.796
Yeah.

2000
01:28:28.796 --> 01:28:31.603
MATT: "Be one of those hip
couples that travels all the time."

2001
01:28:31.603 --> 01:28:32.869
SAM: Totally, yeah.

2002
01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.380
MATT: "Maybe I'll get a tan."

2003
01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.830
SAM: Ooh, you would look good with a tan.

2004
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:38.855
MATT: "Think so?"

2005
01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:41.663
SAM: Yeah, you're very pasty.

2006
01:28:41.663 --> 01:28:42.496
MATT: "Yeah."

2007
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:45.525
SAM: But you know, when you're tanning,

2008
01:28:45.525 --> 01:28:47.866
stay at least 25 feet from the water.

2009
01:28:47.866 --> 01:28:51.073
LAURA: You're such a shithead. (laughs)

2010
01:28:51.073 --> 01:28:52.350
SAM: Okay.
MATT: "Okay."

2011
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:55.060
SAM: All right, I'll be back in a couple weeks, I think.

2012
01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:57.170
MATT: "Okay. We'll be here."

2013
01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:58.003
SAM: Okay.

2014
01:28:59.670 --> 01:29:00.937
We probably have 10 minutes

2015
01:29:00.937 --> 01:29:03.650
before I have to leave, so take off your pants.

2016
01:29:03.650 --> 01:29:05.266
(laughter)

2017
01:29:05.266 --> 01:29:06.482
MATT: "Yes, madam."

2018
01:29:06.482 --> 01:29:09.915
(laughter)

2019
01:29:11.253 --> 01:29:12.570
MATT: All right, the rest of you guys got your stuff.

2020
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.950
Any last minute business, or are we heading to the docks?

2021
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.592
LAURA: Let's go.
MARISHA: To the docks.

2022
01:29:17.592 --> 01:29:18.874
ASHLEY: Let's go!
TRAVIS: To the boats!

2023
01:29:18.874 --> 01:29:20.532
TALIESIN: Let's go to the docks.

2024
01:29:20.532 --> 01:29:21.782
MATT: All righty.

2025
01:29:21.782 --> 01:29:23.649
TALIESIN: To the docks.
TRAVIS: What's in the docks?

2026
01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:25.500
MATT: You make your way to the Balleater.

2027
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:28.063
Your crew is waiting for you.

2028
01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:30.961
Smaller than usual, just because there's only so much room

2029
01:29:30.961 --> 01:29:32.185
on the ship.

2030
01:29:33.718 --> 01:29:36.476
The four main crew that operate it stay behind.

2031
01:29:36.476 --> 01:29:38.290
That includes Marius and Orly,

2032
01:29:39.187 --> 01:29:41.253
and I believe it's Gallan

2033
01:29:41.253 --> 01:29:44.536
and one other person you haven't met.

2034
01:29:44.536 --> 01:29:45.981
It is, yeah, Gallan.

2035
01:29:48.804 --> 01:29:51.068
The rest of you all make your way up there.

2036
01:29:51.068 --> 01:29:54.480
The sails are unfurled, anchor is raised,

2037
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.373
and you join the outskirts of the armada as it begins

2038
01:29:58.373 --> 01:30:01.248
to make its way out into the open waters of the Lucidian

2039
01:30:01.248 --> 01:30:04.748
Ocean, heading southward, to southeast.

2040
01:30:05.890 --> 01:30:06.848
That's where we're going to take a break.

2041
01:30:06.848 --> 01:30:08.673
(groans, low cheering)

2042
01:30:08.673 --> 01:30:09.839
LIAM: To the sea!

2043
01:30:11.418 --> 01:30:13.240
MATT: We'll be back here in just a few

2044
01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.583
minutes, but in the meantime we
do have our Wyrmwood giveaway.

2045
01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:19.692

2085
01:31:42.502 --> 01:31:43.335
LIAM: Yeah.
MISTY: Yeah.

2086
01:31:45.116 --> 01:31:46.003
LIAM: What the fuck?!

2087
01:31:46.003 --> 01:31:46.836
SAM: How?

2088
01:31:46.836 --> 01:31:48.044
ASHLY: How did you--
SAM: That's impossible.

2089
01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:50.737
MISTY: Right here is the one pair of handcuffs
from which Houdini

2090
01:31:50.737 --> 01:31:51.873
could not escape.

2091
01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.491
Then you can actually ask this owl yes or no questions.

2092
01:31:56.491 --> 01:31:59.234
SAM: Will I die a painful death?

2093
01:31:59.234 --> 01:32:01.326
Eyy! That's good!
ASHLY: That's nice!

2094
01:32:01.326 --> 01:32:03.709
MISTY: Do you have any martial arts background or anything?

2095
01:32:06.717 --> 01:32:08.050
LIAM: One more time.

2096
01:32:09.915 --> 01:32:11.487
MISTY: Yes, yes!

2097
01:32:11.487 --> 01:32:13.878
SAM: And then, I've seen magicians do this where they

2098
01:32:13.878 --> 01:32:14.901
(chains rattling)

2099
01:32:14.901 --> 01:32:16.146
MISTY: Definitely!

2100
01:32:16.146 --> 01:32:17.813
ASHLEY: Put some mustard on it, okay.

2101
01:32:19.132 --> 01:32:20.772
MISTY: Yeah, girl!
ASHLY: Don't do that face.

2102
01:32:20.772 --> 01:32:24.513
SAM: Oh! Oh! <i>Oh!</i>

2103
01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.087
ASHLY: Magic.

2104
01:32:27.087 --> 01:32:29.670
(jazzy music)

2105
01:32:35.222 --> 01:32:37.380
BRANDON: No one has ever really tried to adapt

2106
01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:40.763
an RPG campaign into an animated series.

2107
01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:42.640
So we're actually breaking new ground.

2108
01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.953
JENNIFER: They created something that we

2109
01:32:44.953 --> 01:32:46.600
didn't know the world needed.

2110
01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.338
MEREDITH: Really there's something there for everyone.

2111
01:32:48.338 --> 01:32:49.882
MARC: Even if you are steeped in this world,

2112
01:32:49.882 --> 01:32:50.989
there's still a couple of moments

2113
01:32:50.989 --> 01:32:52.278
I think we can surprise you.

2114
01:32:52.278 --> 01:32:54.735
MATT: All this stuff coming out is just so freaking cool.

2115
01:32:55.835 --> 01:32:58.418
(intense music)

2116
01:33:05.543 --> 01:33:08.082
MATT: So the story of Vox Machina takes place on Tal'Dorei,

2117
01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.993
which is a continent in the world of Exandria.

2118
01:33:09.993 --> 01:33:13.460
It is an area of smaller nations, but there is an overall

2119
01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:16.830
sovereign, Uriel, who is the leader of the area.

2120
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:20.867
Vox Machina are a bunch of-- I can't say heroes, really.

2121
01:33:20.867 --> 01:33:23.233
But they are people that are trying to get by

2122
01:33:23.233 --> 01:33:25.148
and they found that it's easier to survive

2123
01:33:25.148 --> 01:33:27.720
and succeed as a group than independently.

2124
01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:31.360
And so, out of necessity, they became a party.

2125
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:34.118
The series begins with a new story.

2126
01:33:34.118 --> 01:33:38.717
This is a telling of Vox Machina as they come into their own

2127
01:33:38.717 --> 01:33:39.782
as a group.

2128
01:33:39.782 --> 01:33:42.978
EUGENE: It's a fantasy series. It's mature.

2129
01:33:42.978 --> 01:33:46.142
It is fun. It is about camaraderie, it's about friendship.

2130
01:33:46.142 --> 01:33:49.510
We are going to explore all of these amazing

2131
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:51.708
fantasy elements that people shied away from.

2132
01:33:51.708 --> 01:33:53.622
We embrace that. We love that stuff.

2133
01:33:53.622 --> 01:33:57.122
BRANDON: It's a completely unique thing,
in terms of high fantasy.

2134
01:33:57.122 --> 01:33:59.960
There's been no high fantasy that's even remotely

2135
01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.398
similar to The Legend of Vox Machina.

2136
01:34:02.398 --> 01:34:04.600
MAE: I think people will be able to
look at this and be like,

2137
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.338
"Oh, this is a show with dragons and demons,

2138
01:34:07.338 --> 01:34:09.560
"and, like, everything in between, but ultimately,

2139
01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.335
"it's about this group of friends."

2140
01:34:11.335 --> 01:34:14.240
MATT: We wanted to capture the spark and the magic

2141
01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.564
of when we were playing at the table,

2142
01:34:16.564 --> 01:34:18.060
just in a different form of media.

2143
01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:19.493
MEREDITH: I'm just really excited to

2144
01:34:19.493 --> 01:34:22.109
see the really heartfelt, touching scenes.

2145
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:25.711
That's what got me into the stream in the first place.

2146
01:34:25.711 --> 01:34:28.713
MAE: This is something that is very serious and dramatic,

2147
01:34:28.713 --> 01:34:31.760
but has moments of intense and beautiful levity

2148
01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.372
and lightheartedness, and that comes from literally

2149
01:34:34.372 --> 01:34:36.392
this was a group of friends having fun.

2150
01:34:36.392 --> 01:34:37.800
And we, as the writers' room,

2151
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.408
should also be a group of friends having fun.

2152
01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:43.269
And that was the moment I was like, we got this.

2153
01:34:45.405 --> 01:34:47.790
BRANDON: Well, the writers' room was just,
it was just a blast,

2154
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:50.615
you know, getting to work with all these amazingly talented

2155
01:34:50.615 --> 01:34:55.337
writers who are all big fans of fantasy and RPGs.

2156
01:34:55.337 --> 01:34:57.108
EUGENE: God, the writers were all amazing.

2157
01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:59.243
And they all brought different things to the table.

2158
01:34:59.243 --> 01:35:02.350
JENNIFER: We had a mix of seasoned and new.

2159
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:05.787
There's young, excited energy, and then

2160
01:35:05.787 --> 01:35:08.898
wise, laid back energy, a little bit.

2161
01:35:08.898 --> 01:35:09.955
KEVIN: There is sort of the who's who

2162
01:35:09.955 --> 01:35:12.427
for what sort of action animation we've done

2163
01:35:12.427 --> 01:35:14.266
have been to the top tier people,

2164
01:35:14.266 --> 01:35:16.451
some really great new voices that have come from

2165
01:35:16.451 --> 01:35:17.842
science fiction and from live action.

2166
01:35:17.842 --> 01:35:19.796
It's really been a nice mix.

2167
01:35:19.796 --> 01:35:21.846
♪ Role, Critical Role ♪

2168
01:35:21.846 --> 01:35:23.149
MATT: We've never worked with Brandon before, so

2169
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:25.330
this is the first time me and him were able to collaborate

2170
01:35:25.330 --> 01:35:28.515
on something, but he was just a great idea guy,

2171
01:35:28.515 --> 01:35:31.862
as well as being the person who's
guiding the production side.

2172
01:35:31.862 --> 01:35:34.270
BRANDON: Eugene Son, our story editor,

2173
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:36.546
he's been incredibly helpful along the way,

2174
01:35:36.546 --> 01:35:38.129
really implementing all of our notes,

2175
01:35:38.129 --> 01:35:40.365
coming in and having all kinds of great ideas.

2176
01:35:40.365 --> 01:35:42.815
EUGENE: Jen Muro knows so much about Critical Role.

2177
01:35:42.815 --> 01:35:44.113
She's been a fan for a while

2178
01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:46.570
and she could recall a lot of the things, the adventures

2179
01:35:46.570 --> 01:35:48.642
and such that the characters have gone through.

2180
01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:52.073
Mae Catt has so much energy and so many ideas.

2181
01:35:52.073 --> 01:35:53.898
She was fantastic in the writers' room that way.

2182
01:35:53.898 --> 01:35:56.722
Kevin and Doc are an amazing writing team that I've gotten

2183
01:35:56.722 --> 01:35:58.035
the pleasure work with over the years.

2184
01:35:58.035 --> 01:36:00.137
Their dynamic as a writing team is fantastic.

2185
01:36:00.137 --> 01:36:02.207
I'd never worked with Marc before, but he brings a wealth

2186
01:36:02.207 --> 01:36:04.280
of experience in comics and live acted TV.

2187
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:05.555
We also worked with Daniel Thomsen,

2188
01:36:05.555 --> 01:36:06.992
who came from the live action world.

2189
01:36:06.992 --> 01:36:09.690
Brought a whole different kind of storytelling to the room.

2190
01:36:09.690 --> 01:36:11.722
Ashly Burch, I had never worked with before until

2191
01:36:11.722 --> 01:36:13.552
Vox Machina, but she's fantastic!

2192
01:36:13.552 --> 01:36:15.600
MATT: Beyond just being a talented writer,

2193
01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.132
she's actually played with us.

2194
01:36:17.132 --> 01:36:19.523
She played Keg in our second campaign for a number

2195
01:36:19.523 --> 01:36:21.332
of episodes, as well as a live show.

2196
01:36:21.332 --> 01:36:23.542
And so I think bringing that to the table,

2197
01:36:23.542 --> 01:36:26.018
made her even that much more of a powerhouse.

2198
01:36:26.018 --> 01:36:28.110
MARC: Everybody was, you know, soup to nuts, like,

2199
01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:29.993
really, really nice and really, really smart.

2200
01:36:29.993 --> 01:36:31.780
MATT: I love when the writers' room is everyone throwing out

2201
01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:33.842
ideas and everyone's building on each other.

2202
01:36:33.842 --> 01:36:35.662
And it's from all different facets, just

2203
01:36:35.662 --> 01:36:39.347
brick after brick, you can see the wall coming to fruition.

2204
01:36:39.347 --> 01:36:43.260
EUGENE: It's fascinating adapting The Legend of Vox Machina

2205
01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:46.464
from a role playing game campaign

2206
01:36:46.464 --> 01:36:49.963
and trying to translate that and bring that to life

2207
01:36:49.963 --> 01:36:51.098
in an animated series.

2208
01:36:51.098 --> 01:36:54.710
MAE: An adaptation need not be beat for beat.

2209
01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:59.100
And so our job, as the writers, was to maintain the spirit

2210
01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.475
of the story and the spirit of each character

2211
01:37:01.475 --> 01:37:03.975
and the character arcs and what they're going through

2212
01:37:03.975 --> 01:37:07.310
and act as the translators from what it was

2213
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:10.612
into what it can be now in the animated form.

2214
01:37:10.612 --> 01:37:11.782
BRANDON: There's going to be surprises,

2215
01:37:11.782 --> 01:37:13.542
there's going to be things that are changed,

2216
01:37:13.542 --> 01:37:15.465
but also at the same time, we want to do that because

2217
01:37:15.465 --> 01:37:17.892
we want the diehard fans to not just come in

2218
01:37:17.892 --> 01:37:20.168
and know everything. Like, you want to be surprised.

2219
01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:22.613
You want things to change just enough.

2220
01:37:22.613 --> 01:37:25.300
MARC: To find a way to get to a place in the story

2221
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.480
where you're giving the audience

2222
01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.593
the thing they didn't know that they wanted,

2223
01:37:29.593 --> 01:37:31.248
but they actually needed.

2224
01:37:31.248 --> 01:37:32.837
EUGENE: When you're dealing with a preexisting property,

2225
01:37:32.837 --> 01:37:34.502
like a, say, a graphic novel, you'd say,

2226
01:37:34.502 --> 01:37:37.257
"Okay, we have to keep this moment.
This is a pivotal moment.

2227
01:37:37.257 --> 01:37:39.442
"Maybe we can lose this, maybe we can plus this."

2228
01:37:39.442 --> 01:37:41.403
When you're going with a campaign where it's

2229
01:37:41.403 --> 01:37:43.730
hundreds of hours of material

2230
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:45.830
and a lot of it is really brilliant, it's like,

2231
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:47.452
okay, now what are the things that would translate

2232
01:37:47.452 --> 01:37:48.660
really well to an animated series?

2233
01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:49.735
What have they not seen

2234
01:37:49.735 --> 01:37:51.592
that we think, "Wow okay, we can take this,

2235
01:37:51.592 --> 01:37:53.495
"and we can really do something fantastic with it."

2236
01:37:53.495 --> 01:37:55.537
And those are the things that really excite us.

2237
01:37:55.537 --> 01:37:59.173
JENNIFER: Whittling down source material was an undertaking

2238
01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:01.306
that I was terrified about because

2239
01:38:01.306 --> 01:38:03.181
Matt has such a clear vision,

2240
01:38:03.181 --> 01:38:05.435
and I definitely did not want to step on that.

2241
01:38:05.435 --> 01:38:07.865
MATT: Certain ideas have to be changed

2242
01:38:07.865 --> 01:38:11.511
or altered as part of the adaptation. It's a hard process.

2243
01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:12.344
JENNIFER: There's things we were, like,

2244
01:38:12.344 --> 01:38:13.960
"Oh, my god, he'll kill us."

2245
01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.012
And then he was like, "No, that's fine."

2246
01:38:15.012 --> 01:38:17.817
We're like, "We were worrying for three days about this."

2247
01:38:17.817 --> 01:38:19.330
MARC: Matt would always sit down and say,

2248
01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:21.188
"Yeah, no, this is the way it was in the campaign,

2249
01:38:21.188 --> 01:38:23.188
"but if this is better, let's talk about it,

2250
01:38:23.188 --> 01:38:25.880
"let's litigate it. Let's investigate it,
let's rattle test it."

2251
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.600
MATT: Sometimes the harder ideas, the ones that go against

2252
01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.608
what you initially expected,
make the most important changes.

2253
01:38:32.608 --> 01:38:34.643
EUGENE: Every project I've ever taken on,

2254
01:38:34.643 --> 01:38:36.093
research is a huge part of it.

2255
01:38:36.093 --> 01:38:39.266
You want to dive and get in that mindset and that mentality

2256
01:38:39.266 --> 01:38:40.793
of the world you're exploring.

2257
01:38:40.793 --> 01:38:44.337
MAE: Critical Role is an IP and is a legacy IP,

2258
01:38:44.337 --> 01:38:46.357
but it's happening right now.

2259
01:38:46.357 --> 01:38:49.285
You can interface with the creators of this thing

2260
01:38:49.285 --> 01:38:51.450
that you love immediately.

2261
01:38:51.450 --> 01:38:53.360
MATT: Everyone, for the most part, were able to make it

2262
01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.210
for an element of the writers' room to

2263
01:38:56.210 --> 01:38:58.343
answer questions about their particular character,

2264
01:38:58.343 --> 01:38:59.793
how they would react to certain elements.

2265
01:38:59.793 --> 01:39:01.709
You know, questions that I couldn't have answered

2266
01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:03.272
anywhere near as good as they could've.

2267
01:39:03.272 --> 01:39:05.883
DOC: The fact that the cast created their own characters

2268
01:39:05.883 --> 01:39:09.518
and that Matt, as the game master, created the scenarios

2269
01:39:09.518 --> 01:39:12.137
and then you're in the writers' room with those people,

2270
01:39:12.137 --> 01:39:15.518
with that cast, you get to feed off that immediacy.

2271
01:39:15.518 --> 01:39:17.205
It's like writing a Spider-Man script

2272
01:39:17.205 --> 01:39:18.717
in the room with Stan Lee.

2273
01:39:18.717 --> 01:39:22.357
MEREDITH: It's working very hard to honor the original canon

2274
01:39:22.357 --> 01:39:24.862
and the original content and the original game.

2275
01:39:24.862 --> 01:39:26.528
BRANDON: Nothing is getting past these guys.

2276
01:39:26.528 --> 01:39:28.893
We're making sure that, like, this is very much

2277
01:39:28.893 --> 01:39:30.517
the show that they want to make.

2278
01:39:30.517 --> 01:39:32.903
MATT: It's been really cool to watch it all come together.

2279
01:39:32.903 --> 01:39:36.558
And as each thing gets approved and, you know,

2280
01:39:36.558 --> 01:39:39.468
we see every facet of it begin to
become more and more realized,

2281
01:39:39.468 --> 01:39:41.718
you can just feel the palpable energy of excitement.

2282
01:39:41.718 --> 01:39:44.095
Not just within us, but the animation studio,

2283
01:39:44.095 --> 01:39:46.345
and everyone who's working on the actual production side.

2284
01:39:46.345 --> 01:39:48.790
It's already turning into something very special.

2285
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:51.984
KEVIN: We are as excited as any fan of Critical Role

2286
01:39:51.984 --> 01:39:54.102
to see how these things turn out.

2287
01:39:54.102 --> 01:39:56.020
There's nothing better than if you love a property

2288
01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.762
and you're seeing it expanded to a new world.

2289
01:39:57.762 --> 01:39:59.365
It just takes it in a way you never even

2290
01:39:59.365 --> 01:40:00.618
could envision as a fan.

2291
01:40:00.618 --> 01:40:04.123
MATT: We wanted to capture the spark and the magic of

2292
01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:05.805
when we were playing at the table,

2293
01:40:05.805 --> 01:40:07.760
just in a different form of media.

2294
01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.955
MARC: It will be like drinking a drink that you really like

2295
01:40:10.955 --> 01:40:13.160
by a bartender you've never met before,

2296
01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.643
who, like, adds a little something

2297
01:40:14.643 --> 01:40:16.461
and you can't quite put your finger on what it is.

2298
01:40:16.461 --> 01:40:18.298
Is like, "Did you put, like, nutmeg in this?"

2299
01:40:18.298 --> 01:40:20.795
And like, "Mm, I'm not sure, but I love this drink.

2300
01:40:20.795 --> 01:40:24.154
"Oh, it's delicious. Give me more of this drink
because I like being drunk."

2301
01:40:24.154 --> 01:40:25.813
If you like being drunk on Critical Role,

2302
01:40:25.813 --> 01:40:27.277
then I think you'll like what this series

2303
01:40:27.277 --> 01:40:28.886
of bartenders have done to it.

2304
01:40:28.886 --> 01:40:31.886
(intense drums)

2305
01:40:34.581 --> 01:40:37.164
(Critical Role theme backing track)

2306
01:40:52.818 --> 01:40:55.273
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

2307
01:40:55.273 --> 01:40:57.334
SAM: What are those things where you have two sticks

2308
01:40:57.334 --> 01:41:01.131
and then a third stick and you, like, boop boop boop boop.

2309
01:41:01.131 --> 01:41:04.442
MARISHA: Are they just called, like, juggling sticks?

2310
01:41:04.442 --> 01:41:06.275
SAM: What are they called? They got to be called something.

2311
01:41:06.275 --> 01:41:07.348
You don't do this?

2312
01:41:07.348 --> 01:41:08.257
MARISHA: Devil sticks?

2313
01:41:08.257 --> 01:41:10.123
SAM: Devil sticks. I knew you'd get it.

2314
01:41:10.123 --> 01:41:10.956
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

2315
01:41:10.956 --> 01:41:15.337
SAM: That's what you should learn
how to do with the Wyrmwood stuff.

2316
01:41:15.337 --> 01:41:16.680
Devil sticks.

2317
01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.480
BRIAN: Do you understand how valuable
and rare a lot of this wood is,

2318
01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.183
and you want me to juggle with it?

2319
01:41:22.183 --> 01:41:23.182
(giggling)

2320
01:41:23.182 --> 01:41:26.229
SAM: How dare I.
BRIAN: How dare you, sir.

2321
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:29.487
Can I come over and-- you know, have you ever seen people

2322
01:41:29.487 --> 01:41:31.120
juggle with bowling pins?
SAM: Sure.

2323
01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.450
BRIAN: Can I do that with your rare wines?
SAM: Hmm.

2324
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:38.170
BRIAN: Huh? Then I won't let you
do it with my fucking Wyrmwood.

2325
01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:40.228
Ask something like that again on this fucking show.

2326
01:41:40.228 --> 01:41:43.113
Wait till we go on break or something to ask shit like that.

2327
01:41:43.113 --> 01:41:46.104
MARISHA: There's so much tension on the show.

2328
01:41:46.104 --> 01:41:46.937
BRIAN: We're tired!

2329
01:41:46.937 --> 01:41:48.137
MARISHA: We're so tired and cranky.

2330
01:41:48.137 --> 01:41:49.096
SAM: I'm fine.

2331
01:41:50.098 --> 01:41:51.912
I'm fine!

2332
01:41:51.912 --> 01:41:53.670
MARISHA: I know you've cried in the shower.

2333
01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:54.526
BRIAN: You've cried in the shower.

2334
01:41:54.526 --> 01:41:56.872
MARISHA: I know you have. I know you're fucking lying.

2335
01:41:56.872 --> 01:41:58.862
SAM: What would I cry about in the shower?

2336
01:41:58.862 --> 01:42:00.135
MARISHA: Oh, you fucking liar.

2337
01:42:00.135 --> 01:42:02.247
BRIAN: What makes you sad, Sam?

2338
01:42:02.247 --> 01:42:03.260
SAM: (exhales)

2339
01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.753
BRIAN: "One of the most subtly powerful moments in a show

2340
01:42:05.753 --> 01:42:07.490
"with lots of them was Nott turning down

2341
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:10.277
"Yasha's offer of a sip of wine just before

2342
01:42:10.277 --> 01:42:11.620
"the transformation."

2343
01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.613
MARISHA: Oh yeah, it was beautiful.

2344
01:42:13.613 --> 01:42:16.996
BRIAN: "Could you walk us through what
Nott/Veth was thinking

2345
01:42:16.996 --> 01:42:19.205
"in that moment and how Veth's attitude toward

2346
01:42:19.205 --> 01:42:22.102
"her drinking problem has changed."

2347
01:42:22.102 --> 01:42:26.003
SAM: Yeah, maybe she thinks that she she might be okay now.

2348
01:42:26.003 --> 01:42:28.097
She doesn't need it anymore.

2349
01:42:28.097 --> 01:42:29.635
BRIAN: Wow.
SAM: Yeah.

2350
01:42:29.635 --> 01:42:31.272
BRIAN: Is that a reflection on you, Sam?

2351
01:42:31.272 --> 01:42:32.988
Will you be giving up booze as well

2352
01:42:32.988 --> 01:42:35.096
and perhaps maybe auctioning off

2353
01:42:35.096 --> 01:42:37.587
some of your rare wines that we referenced earlier

2354
01:42:37.587 --> 01:42:40.455
in the juggling conversation?

2355
01:42:40.455 --> 01:42:42.993
SAM: I think I need to go take a shower.

2356
01:42:42.993 --> 01:42:45.627
BRIAN: Oh! Oh goodness.
DANI: Finally.

2357
01:42:45.627 --> 01:42:49.212
BRIAN: Is it possible that we have cracked the--

2358
01:42:49.212 --> 01:42:50.986
there we go.
SAM: (fake crying)

2359
01:42:50.986 --> 01:42:52.458
BRIAN: There we go.

2360
01:42:52.458 --> 01:42:54.291
SAM: I don't want to give up my wine!

2361
01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:55.156
I love it.

2362
01:42:55.156 --> 01:42:56.624
(crying) I love it so much.

2363
01:42:56.624 --> 01:42:59.040
BRIAN: All the wine's coming with me.

2364
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.538
SAM: What are these bubbles?

2365
01:43:00.538 --> 01:43:01.543
MARISHA: That's your tears.

2366
01:43:01.543 --> 01:43:02.451
SAM: Oh, the tears!

2367
01:43:02.451 --> 01:43:04.087
BRIAN: That's tears in the shower.

2368
01:43:04.087 --> 01:43:08.683
SAM: I've never cried before,
so I didn't understand what was-- (sobbing)

2369
01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:09.546
I love my wine.

2370
01:43:09.546 --> 01:43:10.379
BRIAN: Like tears in--

2371
01:43:10.379 --> 01:43:13.862
SAM: (crying) I love my Brunello di Montalcino!

2372
01:43:13.862 --> 01:43:16.395
I love my Pinot Noir!

2373
01:43:16.395 --> 01:43:19.178
BRIAN: List them off for us, all your wine.

2374
01:43:19.178 --> 01:43:20.678
SAM: I love my Cab Francs!

2375
01:43:23.207 --> 01:43:26.092
It's almost Beaujolais season!

2376
01:43:26.092 --> 01:43:27.625
DANI: Beaujolais has to be made up.

2377
01:43:32.062 --> 01:43:34.812
(birds chirping)

2378
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:39.895
SAM: I'm a fan of hot air balloon rides above

2379
01:43:39.895 --> 01:43:41.803
the Venetian countryside.

2380
01:43:43.062 --> 01:43:44.565
I'm a fan of Momlan.

2381
01:43:44.565 --> 01:43:46.215
She's always got my back.

2382
01:43:47.558 --> 01:43:50.808
I'm a fan of wine older than Taliesin.

2383
01:43:51.912 --> 01:43:52.812
Hmm.

2384
01:43:52.812 --> 01:43:55.590
I'm a fan of Twitch subscriptions.

2385
01:43:57.093 --> 01:44:00.968
I'm a fan of emotes by Arsequeef, they're neat.

2386
01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:04.155
I'm a fan of a wife so cool

2387
01:44:04.155 --> 01:44:05.855
(distorted) people forget I exist exist.

2388
01:44:05.855 --> 01:44:06.705
Exist.

2389
01:44:07.812 --> 01:44:09.249

(short panting)

2398
01:44:32.344 --> 01:44:33.344
I'm a fan of

2399
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.353
wearing your skin as a mask.

2400
01:44:41.005 --> 01:44:43.422
(Vivaldi's "Spring" from "Four Seasons")

2401
01:44:56.265 --> 01:44:58.848
(intense folk rock music)

2402
01:57:55.212 --> 01:57:56.222
MATT: And welcome back.

2403
01:57:56.222 --> 01:57:58.479
So before

2404
01:57:58.479 --> 01:58:00.978
before we get into the game, we do have our Wyrmwood winner.

2405
01:58:00.978 --> 01:58:04.697
Wyrmwood winner for tonight is FamTheWizard.

2406
01:58:04.697 --> 01:58:05.963
TRAVIS: (chanting) Fam- the wizard!

2407
01:58:05.963 --> 01:58:07.754
MATT: FamTheWizard, congratulations.
MARISHA: (chanting) Fam- the wizard!

2408
01:58:07.754 --> 01:58:10.770
ALL: (chanting) Fam Fam the wizard!

2409
01:58:11.756 --> 01:58:13.065
Congratulations to you, FamTheWizard.

2410
01:58:13.065 --> 01:58:16.045
We'll have that box sent out to you ASAP.

2411
01:58:16.045 --> 01:58:20.771
All righty, so The Mighty Nein heading off to sea--

2412
01:58:20.771 --> 01:58:22.435
LAURA: Oh gosh!
MATT: -- for a many days' journey.

2413
01:58:22.435 --> 01:58:25.360
It is about, looking at it in the detailed elements,

2414
01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.451
about 395 miles around the
southern edge of the Ashkeeper Peaks,

2415
01:58:29.451 --> 01:58:32.020
avoiding the Inkclaw Reef, that'll be to the south,

2416
01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:35.062
and into the open waters of the designated meeting location

2417
01:58:35.062 --> 01:58:36.378
within Lucidian Ocean.

2418
01:58:36.378 --> 01:58:39.771
The armada moves at the speed
of its slowest ship as one piece.

2419
01:58:39.771 --> 01:58:40.604
TALIESIN: Is that us?

2420
01:58:40.604 --> 01:58:44.613
MATT: In optimal weather, travel is
set to be between nine to 11 days.

2421
01:58:44.613 --> 01:58:45.521
MARISHA: Oh shit.

2422
01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:46.771
SAM: Nine to 11 months?!

2423
01:58:46.771 --> 01:58:49.225
TALIESIN, MATT, LIAM, and TRAVIS: Days.
SAM: Oh.

2424
01:58:49.225 --> 01:58:50.400
LIAM: We've been shitting around!

2425
01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.820
TRAVIS: Children will be born.

2426
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:52.653
MATT: So.

2427
01:58:54.542 --> 01:58:58.051
Plenty of time on ship. Get to meet

2428
01:58:58.051 --> 01:58:59.218
your old crew.

2429
01:59:00.712 --> 01:59:03.543
Orly is happy to helm as Navigator, but you guys can go back

2430
01:59:03.543 --> 01:59:05.070
to whatever positions you want to,

2431
01:59:05.070 --> 01:59:07.140
or you can return to the previous positions that you've had

2432
01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:08.282
worked and trained as.

2433
01:59:08.282 --> 01:59:11.007
That includes you as the Captain,

2434
01:59:11.007 --> 01:59:14.172
Beauregard as the First Mate or Cooper,

2435
01:59:14.172 --> 01:59:18.010
Caduceus as the Boatswain, Jester as the Carpenter.

2436
01:59:18.010 --> 01:59:19.048
LAURA: Of course I am.

2437
01:59:19.048 --> 01:59:21.016
MATT: Veth as the Powder Monkey.

2438
01:59:21.016 --> 01:59:21.975
SAM: Yep, that's me.

2439
01:59:21.975 --> 01:59:24.067
MATT: And Caleb as the Navigator.

2440
01:59:24.067 --> 01:59:27.157
But you also have Orly able to helm navigation

2441
01:59:27.157 --> 01:59:30.047
if you don't want to have to worry about that,

2442
01:59:30.047 --> 01:59:34.245
or you can have Marius help as a Boatswain as well.

2443
01:59:34.245 --> 01:59:37.238
And Gallan is trained as a Carpenter as well.

2444
01:59:37.238 --> 01:59:39.033
Gallan who has axe scarred.

2445
01:59:39.033 --> 01:59:40.301
MARISHA: And who's the new kid?

2446
01:59:40.301 --> 01:59:42.227
LAURA: (laughs) That's right.

2447
01:59:42.227 --> 01:59:43.186
MATT: Yeah.

2448
01:59:43.186 --> 01:59:44.019
LAURA: Oh no.

2449
01:59:44.865 --> 01:59:45.715
TRAVIS: The new kid?

2450
01:59:45.715 --> 01:59:46.548
MARISHA: Yeah, who's the new kid?

2451
01:59:46.548 --> 01:59:47.382
You said there was a new kid?
MATT: Oh right, yeah.

2452
01:59:47.382 --> 01:59:48.890
There was a fourth person who is--

2453
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:50.156
TALIESIN: New-ish.

2454
01:59:50.156 --> 01:59:51.666
MARISHA: Yeah.

2455
01:59:51.666 --> 01:59:52.941
MATT: Let me see here.

2456
01:59:54.281 --> 01:59:55.114
ASHLEY: (whispering) That's weird.

2457
01:59:56.857 --> 01:59:58.200
MATT: Shelda is her name.

2458
01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.033
MARISHA: Shelda.

2459
01:59:59.033 --> 01:59:59.866
MATT: Yeah.

2460
02:00:00.727 --> 02:00:05.618
She is a half elf, young punk looking kid,

2461
02:00:05.618 --> 02:00:09.160
maybe no more than 19 or so.

2462
02:00:10.243 --> 02:00:13.538
Looks scrappy. Probably came from a relatively impoverished

2463
02:00:13.538 --> 02:00:17.172
upbringing and is definitely in shades of young Beauregard,

2464
02:00:17.172 --> 02:00:20.360
looking to prove themself out at sea.

2465
02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:21.758
TRAVIS: How old is Shelda?

2466
02:00:21.758 --> 02:00:22.900
MATT: Shelda-- you're not sure,

2467
02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:26.000
but it looks to be, like, late teens, early 20s.

2468
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.373
MARISHA: I go up to her.

2469
02:00:27.373 --> 02:00:31.347
MATT: Okay, you see her with her jet black hair itself

2470
02:00:31.347 --> 02:00:35.372
that's short in the back in this big long

2471
02:00:35.372 --> 02:00:37.843
curled mess in the front that, like, covers part

2472
02:00:37.843 --> 02:00:40.317
of the face a bit as it plumes forward.

2473
02:00:41.617 --> 02:00:43.812
Looks at you with the one immediately visible eye,

2474
02:00:43.812 --> 02:00:46.417
the other one obscured between the rest of the hair

2475
02:00:46.417 --> 02:00:49.308
in front, and goes, "Can I help you?"

2476
02:00:49.308 --> 02:00:50.932
MARISHA: 'Sup?

2477
02:00:50.932 --> 02:00:51.782
MATT: "'Sup?"

2478
02:00:51.782 --> 02:00:53.590
MARISHA: How you doing?

2479
02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:55.726
MATT: "Doing all right."

2480
02:00:55.726 --> 02:00:58.160
MARISHA: You like working with these people?

2481
02:00:58.160 --> 02:00:59.465
MATT: "I've only been with them for a few weeks.

2482
02:00:59.465 --> 02:01:01.167
"They hired me while we were waiting."

2483
02:01:01.167 --> 02:01:03.366
MARISHA: These guys giving you a hard time?

2484
02:01:03.366 --> 02:01:05.240
MATT: "Not yet.

2485
02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:06.890
"Why? Should they?"

2486
02:01:08.410 --> 02:01:10.293
MARISHA: No, I was just checking.

2487
02:01:11.423 --> 02:01:14.723
I mean, I kind of wouldn't care either way.

2488
02:01:16.188 --> 02:01:17.021
So...

2489
02:01:18.992 --> 02:01:20.325
MATT: "This is your ship, right?"

2490
02:01:20.325 --> 02:01:23.195
MARISHA: Yeah, well, mine and my crew's.

2491
02:01:23.195 --> 02:01:27.090
Mighty Nein. I'm technically the first mate.

2492
02:01:27.090 --> 02:01:28.547
MATT: "Well, first mate."

2493
02:01:28.547 --> 02:01:29.380
MARISHA: Yeah.

2494
02:01:30.298 --> 02:01:31.607
MATT: "It's a pleasure."

2495
02:01:31.607 --> 02:01:32.440
MARISHA: Yeah.

2496
02:01:34.383 --> 02:01:36.558
Cool, just wanted to make my acquaintance.

2497
02:01:36.558 --> 02:01:37.910
And then I walk away.

2498
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:39.218
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

2499
02:01:39.218 --> 02:01:41.501
TRAVIS: Want to make my acquaintance?
LIAM: Sure.

2500
02:01:41.501 --> 02:01:44.042
TALIESIN: Smooth move, exlax.
MARISHA: Cool.

2501
02:01:44.042 --> 02:01:46.217
(laughter)

2502
02:01:46.217 --> 02:01:48.213
LAURA: I'm sure she thinks you're really cool.

2503
02:01:48.213 --> 02:01:49.387
TALIESIN: Oh man.

2504
02:01:49.387 --> 02:01:50.926
TRAVIS: Do you know what TikTok videos are?

2505
02:01:50.926 --> 02:01:53.701
(laughter)

2506
02:01:54.748 --> 02:01:56.006
TRAVIS: I'm old.

2507
02:01:57.902 --> 02:01:59.092
MATT: And so...

2508
02:01:59.092 --> 02:02:02.040
TALIESIN: Beau, I got you something.

2509
02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:02.873
MARISHA: What?

2510
02:02:02.873 --> 02:02:04.090
TALIESIN: I picked up something in town.

2511
02:02:04.090 --> 02:02:09.090
I've been waiting to-- I hand Beau the fan.

2512
02:02:09.093 --> 02:02:12.110
Now, do you know what this is?

2513
02:02:13.138 --> 02:02:16.413
MARISHA: I have an idea. It's a fan.
TALIESIN: It is a fan.

2514
02:02:16.413 --> 02:02:17.908
MARISHA: Yeah.

2515
02:02:17.908 --> 02:02:21.440
TALIESIN: So only use it-- try to use it only once a day.

2516
02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.273
MARISHA: Okay

2517
02:02:24.895 --> 02:02:29.123
TALIESIN: Be careful with it. Now, just hold it and--

2518
02:02:29.123 --> 02:02:30.488
LIAM: Just fan yourself.

2519
02:02:30.488 --> 02:02:32.632
TALIESIN: I wouldn't fan-- well--
TRAVIS: (explosion sound)

2520
02:02:32.632 --> 02:02:35.050
(laughter)

2521
02:02:35.050 --> 02:02:36.903
TRAVIS: (low scream)
MATT: (neck breaking sound)

2522
02:02:36.903 --> 02:02:38.505
TRAVIS: Finish her!

2523
02:02:38.505 --> 02:02:40.485
MARISHA: I clack it.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2524
02:02:40.485 --> 02:02:41.593
SAM: (gun cocking)

2525
02:02:43.721 --> 02:02:47.781
LIAM: Peace was never an option.
TALIESIN: See that sea gull right over there?

2526
02:02:47.781 --> 02:02:50.079
MARISHA: Oh, that's mean, Caduceus.

2527
02:02:50.079 --> 02:02:52.720
TALIESIN: You don't even know what it does.

2528
02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:54.790
SAM: (cawing noises)
MARISHA: (whoosh)

2529
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:56.500
MATT: (muffled explosion)

2530
02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:01.500
You just see a spray of feathers as it-- (thudding)

2531
02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:03.598
TALIESIN: Would it do that much?

2532
02:03:03.598 --> 02:03:05.235
It's Gust of Wind.

2533
02:03:05.235 --> 02:03:07.960
MATT: Gust of Wind is, I believe, a 2nd-level spell.

2534
02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.802
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2535
02:03:08.802 --> 02:03:10.068
SAM: (gun cocking)

2536
02:03:10.068 --> 02:03:12.747
LAURA: The Wild Mother's going to be so pissed at you.

2537
02:03:12.747 --> 02:03:16.100
MATT: Yeah, a line of strong wind
60 feet long and 10 feet wide

2538
02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:18.065
blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's

2539
02:03:18.065 --> 02:03:19.298
duration for one minute.

2540
02:03:19.298 --> 02:03:20.764
So right now it's like-- (rushing wind)

2541
02:03:20.764 --> 02:03:22.798
MARISHA: Oh, it's just going?
MATT: It's just going.

2542
02:03:24.181 --> 02:03:26.410
ASHLEY: Put it up to the sails.

2543
02:03:26.410 --> 02:03:28.725
MATT: Each creature in the line
has to succeed in a saving throw

2544
02:03:28.725 --> 02:03:31.697
or be pushed 15 feet away from you every round.

2545
02:03:32.914 --> 02:03:35.963
It disperses gas or vapor, extinguishes candle, torches,

2546
02:03:35.963 --> 02:03:38.515
similar types of flames in the area. It doesn't do any real

2547
02:03:38.515 --> 02:03:41.073
damage, but to a creature that is made mostly

2548
02:03:41.073 --> 02:03:43.540
of feathers-- it didn't kill it,

2549
02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:45.123
but you see it splash in the water

2550
02:03:45.123 --> 02:03:48.098
and it's still in the water, like--

2551
02:03:48.098 --> 02:03:50.133
MARISHA: Caduceus, could you help it?

2552
02:03:50.133 --> 02:03:51.941
TALIESIN: Yeah, yep, hold on.

2553
02:03:53.585 --> 02:03:54.988
LIAM: The Mighty Nein does not like animals.

2554
02:03:54.988 --> 02:03:57.430
MARISHA: Oh this is pretty cool, though. I...

2555
02:03:58.747 --> 02:04:01.020
turn to the sails, do it again.

2556
02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:01.880
MATT: So as a bonus action, you can change

2557
02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:02.713
the direction of it.

2558
02:04:02.713 --> 02:04:03.920
MARISHA: Oh, I can?
MATT: Yeah.

2559
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.870
So you turn-- once you do it,

2560
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:10.080
it creates it for concentration a minute in that direction

2561
02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.500
Then as a bonus action each turn
you can shift the direction of it.

2562
02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.692
MARISHA: I take the fan and I, like, just use

2563
02:04:14.692 --> 02:04:17.447
it to guide the stream.

2564
02:04:17.447 --> 02:04:18.280
MATT: Okay.

2565
02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:21.735
The sail picks up even heavier and for

2566
02:04:21.735 --> 02:04:23.682
the next minute that it lasts,

2567
02:04:23.682 --> 02:04:27.428
there's a little bit of a burst of speed to it,

2568
02:04:27.428 --> 02:04:31.010
I guess you could say. Though, from a physics standpoint...

2569
02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:32.177
Yeah.

2570
02:04:33.335 --> 02:04:35.060
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah. Sure.

2571
02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:37.210
MARISHA: I will keep-- I have to keep.

2572
02:04:37.210 --> 02:04:38.700
Yeah, would it be stationary

2573
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:40.475
or would it be relative to the boat?

2574
02:04:40.475 --> 02:04:41.870
MATT: I would say it's relative to the boat location.

2575
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:42.703
MARISHA: Okay.

2576
02:04:43.590 --> 02:04:46.152
TALIESIN: Yeah, it can be used more
than once, but try and only use

2577
02:04:46.152 --> 02:04:48.213
it once a day because it will fall apart.

2578
02:04:48.213 --> 02:04:49.577
MARISHA: Yeah, it's very pretty rickety.

2579
02:04:49.577 --> 02:04:51.690
TALIESIN: I did cast a healing spell on that poor bird.

2580
02:04:51.690 --> 02:04:52.523
MATT: Okay.

2581
02:04:52.523 --> 02:04:54.168
(chuckles)

2582
02:04:54.168 --> 02:04:55.947
TALIESIN: Oh man, that was that
was more than I was expecting.

2583
02:04:55.947 --> 02:04:57.992
MATT: Feathers appear from outside of its--

2584
02:04:57.992 --> 02:04:59.700
TALIESIN: Sorry, that was really unintentional.

2585
02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.283
MATT: (bird cawing)
TALIESIN: That's fair.

2586
02:05:01.283 --> 02:05:03.997
No-- wow, really?

2587
02:05:03.997 --> 02:05:05.147
Rude. Rude.

2588
02:05:05.147 --> 02:05:06.890
(laughter)

2589
02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:10.580
MARISHA: Thanks, Caduceus. Should I owe you any money

2590
02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:12.222
for this?
TALIESIN: Nah.

2591
02:05:12.222 --> 02:05:13.508
MARISHA: You sure?
TALIESIN: Of course not.

2592
02:05:13.508 --> 02:05:16.348
Yeah.
MARISHA: How awesome do I look with it?

2593
02:05:16.348 --> 02:05:17.648
ASHLEY: It's really pretty cool.

2594
02:05:17.648 --> 02:05:20.775
I feel like it really completes the whole ensemble.

2595
02:05:20.775 --> 02:05:22.345
MARISHA: Pull out my staff, too.

2596
02:05:22.345 --> 02:05:24.261
ASHLEY: Yeah, there it is.
TALIESIN: Yeah, there you are.

2597
02:05:24.261 --> 02:05:26.439
LAURA: Pull up a star, too.

2598
02:05:26.439 --> 02:05:28.758
(laughter)

2599
02:05:28.758 --> 02:05:31.229
LIAM: Now smoke a pipe as well.

2600
02:05:31.229 --> 02:05:32.352
MARISHA: Orly!

2601
02:05:34.287 --> 02:05:36.095
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

2602
02:05:36.095 --> 02:05:37.885
MARISHA: Hold a pipe up to me.

2603
02:05:37.885 --> 02:05:40.055
LAURA: I'm going to draw it.

2604
02:05:40.055 --> 02:05:41.115
MATT: Stomps off.

2605
02:05:41.115 --> 02:05:45.182
MARISHA: Ooh, and I put my leg up on a cask.

2606
02:05:45.182 --> 02:05:46.630
Just like Captain Morgan.

2607
02:05:46.630 --> 02:05:49.428
MATT: Comes back five minutes later
with a little tobacco box

2608
02:05:49.428 --> 02:05:53.641
and, like, sets it up, opens it, takes some tobacco

2609
02:05:53.641 --> 02:05:55.520
and puts it in this long wooden pipe

2610
02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:57.654
with this thin stem at end. He goes.

2611
02:05:57.654 --> 02:06:00.437
MARISHA: Arms are hurting.
MATT: "Here you go."

2612
02:06:00.437 --> 02:06:02.013
LAURA: Stay like that for, like, 30 minutes,

2613
02:06:02.013 --> 02:06:03.388
I want to get this really detailed.

2614
02:06:03.388 --> 02:06:04.505
LIAM: Commemorate the moment.

2615
02:06:04.505 --> 02:06:06.261
TALIESIN: Actually I--
TRAVIS: (whistles)

2616
02:06:06.261 --> 02:06:08.514
SAM: Oh! Tusktooth is calling us!

2617
02:06:08.514 --> 02:06:09.888
TALIESIN: Caleb.
MARISHA: No!

2618
02:06:09.888 --> 02:06:11.468
LAURA: Come on, come on. Hold on, captain.

2619
02:06:11.468 --> 02:06:12.693
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

2620
02:06:12.693 --> 02:06:15.674
MARISHA: She's doing a portrait.
LAURA: I'm doing a really good portrait!

2621
02:06:15.674 --> 02:06:19.307
TRAVIS: You are supposed to be
an example to the crew in my absence.

2622
02:06:19.307 --> 02:06:20.620
What is this?

2623
02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:22.703
MARISHA: This is a glowing example!

2624
02:06:23.962 --> 02:06:26.312
Look at what-- look at-- this is dope!

2625
02:06:26.312 --> 02:06:27.503
TRAVIS: Glowing?

2626
02:06:27.503 --> 02:06:30.644
LIAM: I cast Dancing Lights around Beauregard.

2627
02:06:30.644 --> 02:06:32.452
(laughter)

2628
02:06:32.452 --> 02:06:34.535
LAURA: I add that to the drawing.

2629
02:06:35.922 --> 02:06:38.195
Remarkable.
MATT: It's pretty epic.

2630
02:06:38.195 --> 02:06:41.060
TALIESIN: Veth, Caleb. I picked this up in town, too.

2631
02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:43.665
Maybe between the two of you, you can figure out--

2632
02:06:43.665 --> 02:06:44.498
SAM: What is it?

2633
02:06:44.498 --> 02:06:46.585
TALIESIN: It's-- I don't know. It's a locked box.

2634
02:06:46.585 --> 02:06:49.182
Might be trapped, might be weird, I don't know.

2635
02:06:49.182 --> 02:06:52.247
SAM: I don't know;
when I open these, I die.

2636
02:06:52.247 --> 02:06:53.260
LAURA: Check for traps.

2637
02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:55.080
SAM: Okay. Checking for traps!

2638
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:56.428
MATT: Investigation check.

2639
02:06:56.428 --> 02:06:58.270
TALIESIN: d4.
LAURA: Keep holding it!

2640
02:06:59.525 --> 02:07:02.193
SAM: Plus a d4. Okay.

2641
02:07:02.193 --> 02:07:03.490
Investigation?
MATT: Yes.

2642
02:07:03.490 --> 02:07:05.263
SAM: 25.
MATT: 25.

2643
02:07:05.263 --> 02:07:07.074
It is not trapped.

2644
02:07:07.074 --> 02:07:08.741
LIAM: Wait, hold on.
SAM: It's good.

2645
02:07:09.810 --> 02:07:10.643
LIAM: Uh.

2646
02:07:12.042 --> 02:07:14.293
Just set it on the ground for a moment.

2647
02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:15.201
SAM: I drop it.

2648
02:07:15.201 --> 02:07:17.857
TALIESIN: (explosions)

2649
02:07:17.857 --> 02:07:22.083
MATT: Distant shot of the ship (explosion).

2650
02:07:22.083 --> 02:07:24.458
Just the whole Akira shot.

2651
02:07:24.458 --> 02:07:27.733
LIAM: I will spend 10 minutes and ritually cast Detect Magic

2652
02:07:27.733 --> 02:07:28.666
on it.

2653
02:07:28.666 --> 02:07:29.499
MATT: Okay.

2654
02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:32.003
So you guys wait patiently while

2655
02:07:32.003 --> 02:07:33.686
you're finishing your artwork.
LIAM: Right.

2656
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:40.754
MATT: Orly starts playing his bagpipes in the background.
LAURA: Keep your arms up.

2657
02:07:40.754 --> 02:07:43.687
MATT: (bagpipe playing) Just keeping the
whole ensemble unique.

2658
02:07:43.687 --> 02:07:46.996
SAM: You run a tight ship here, Tusktooth.

2659
02:07:46.996 --> 02:07:49.634
We got painting. We got--
TRAVIS: I'm very rusty.

2660
02:07:49.634 --> 02:07:51.334
How are we doing with the rest of the armada?

2661
02:07:51.334 --> 02:07:52.897
Are we actually, like, speeding up?

2662
02:07:52.897 --> 02:07:54.528
MATT: Well, for that brief instant, you sped up

2663
02:07:54.528 --> 02:07:55.819
a little bit, but--

2664
02:07:55.819 --> 02:07:58.020
TRAVIS: I don't think it works that way, either, actually.
I thought about it.

2665
02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:00.172
MATT: Yeah. I don't think--
TRAVIS: Your instinct was right.

2666
02:08:00.172 --> 02:08:01.648
MATT: Yeah, it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

2667
02:08:01.648 --> 02:08:02.989
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2668
02:08:02.989 --> 02:08:05.425
How do we do, how does our ship do-- minus the fan--

2669
02:08:05.425 --> 02:08:09.050
with the rest of the armada? Half, like, kind of average?

2670
02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:13.140
MATT: About average. I mean, the slowest ship

2671
02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:14.738
is just a standard sailing ship, which can go about

2672
02:08:14.738 --> 02:08:16.730
48 miles in a day.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

2673
02:08:17.605 --> 02:08:19.687
MATT: So that's the pace everyone's

2674
02:08:19.687 --> 02:08:21.270
moving together.

2675
02:08:22.832 --> 02:08:23.896
But

2676
02:08:23.896 --> 02:08:25.618
the slower ships can go,

2677
02:08:25.618 --> 02:08:27.410
the ones that are heavier can go even slower there,

2678
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:30.597
so you're moving about, I'd say, 30 to 35 miles a day.

2679
02:08:30.597 --> 02:08:32.562
The whole armada keeping up with itself.

2680
02:08:32.562 --> 02:08:36.001
TRAVIS: Blue Heaven out towards the peak,
or in the middle, or bringing up the rear?

2681
02:08:36.001 --> 02:08:38.090
MATT: The Blue Heaven's in the center of it.
TRAVIS: Got it.

2682
02:08:38.090 --> 02:08:40.983
MATT: And a few ships adjacent to it is the

2683
02:08:40.983 --> 02:08:42.883
the Wind of Aeons.
TRAVIS: Got it.

2684
02:08:44.817 --> 02:08:46.750
Just going to keep an eye on those.

2685
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:47.825
MATT: Understood.

2686
02:08:48.793 --> 02:08:50.518
You finish casting Detect Magic and

2687
02:08:50.518 --> 02:08:52.651
there is a magical aura from the inside.

2688
02:08:52.651 --> 02:08:55.367
LIAM: Is it abjuration?

2689
02:08:55.367 --> 02:08:57.284
MATT: For this, it would be--

2690
02:08:58.443 --> 02:08:59.852
hold on just a second.

2691
02:09:01.737 --> 02:09:03.721
It's two small sources.

2692
02:09:05.798 --> 02:09:07.173
One is

2693
02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:11.091
faintly conjuration.

2694
02:09:11.091 --> 02:09:12.757
TALIESIN: ♪ Faintly conjuration. ♪

2695
02:09:12.757 --> 02:09:13.590
MATT: The other--

2696
02:09:13.590 --> 02:09:15.650
TRAVIS: Nope. That's not a song.

2697
02:09:15.650 --> 02:09:18.290
MATT: -- is transmutation.

2698
02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:19.656
LAURA: Ooh!

2699
02:09:24.337 --> 02:09:26.602
LIAM: Okay, I don't know.

2700
02:09:26.602 --> 02:09:30.388
SAM: Should I pick the lock? Should we dispel some magic?

2701
02:09:30.388 --> 02:09:32.443
Ooh! Yashie can--

2702
02:09:32.443 --> 02:09:36.753
Wait, does your sword still dispel magic or does that not--

2703
02:09:36.753 --> 02:09:39.841
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I'm not--

2704
02:09:39.841 --> 02:09:43.160
I have my other one right now. I could switch them out.

2705
02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:45.595
LIAM: There also could be a good chance
of destroying the box, though.

2706
02:09:45.595 --> 02:09:47.060
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

2707
02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:49.260
How much did you spend on this, Caduceus?

2708
02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.501
TRAVIS: I don't remember.

2709
02:09:50.501 --> 02:09:53.058
LIAM: Could you do it from a bit back?
SAM: Sure, yeah!

2710
02:09:53.058 --> 02:09:55.625
LIAM: I think everybody should get away from it

2711
02:09:55.625 --> 02:09:57.612
while Veth does her thing.
ASHLEY: Maybe open it out?

2712
02:09:57.612 --> 02:09:58.445
SAM: Sure.

2713
02:09:58.445 --> 02:09:59.503
LIAM: Okay.

2714
02:09:59.503 --> 02:10:02.313
So we'll make a nice wide ring around the box.

2715
02:10:02.313 --> 02:10:03.292
MATT: All righty.

2716
02:10:03.292 --> 02:10:06.243
SAM: Tusktooth, should I not do this on the ship?

2717
02:10:06.243 --> 02:10:07.926
I mean, is this okay, do I have--

2718
02:10:07.926 --> 02:10:11.190
Captain, permission to pick the lock!

2719
02:10:11.190 --> 02:10:14.247
TRAVIS: Excellent. Permission granted.

2720
02:10:14.247 --> 02:10:15.768
SAM: Aye aye.

2721
02:10:15.768 --> 02:10:17.160
All right.
TALIESIN: He's gone mad with power.

2722
02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:17.993
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: I'll put it

2723
02:10:17.993 --> 02:10:20.555
right at the front of the ship where the,

2724
02:10:20.555 --> 02:10:24.720
I guess, I presume the lady is at the front of the ship.

2725
02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:25.886
Do we have one of those?
LAURA: Yeah, we do.

2726
02:10:25.886 --> 02:10:26.894
SAM: Okay, cool.

2727
02:10:26.894 --> 02:10:27.852
MATT: There you go.

2728
02:10:27.852 --> 02:10:30.593
SAM: Right on top of her and I'll cast Mage Hand

2729
02:10:30.593 --> 02:10:31.915
and I will pick the lock.

2730
02:10:31.915 --> 02:10:33.076
MATT: Go for it.

2731
02:10:33.076 --> 02:10:34.284
TALIESIN: d4.

2732
02:10:34.284 --> 02:10:36.108
SAM: (sharp inhale)
LAURA: (laughs)

2733
02:10:36.108 --> 02:10:38.760
Do you get the advantage? Did we give you advantage on it?

2734
02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:39.593
SAM: No.

2735
02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:42.790
Technically, I can reroll that, but I'm not going to.

2736
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:44.823
LIAM: You have to, halfling, you have to!
LAURA: Do it! You do.

2737
02:10:44.823 --> 02:10:45.656
SAM: I don't have to.

2738
02:10:45.656 --> 02:10:46.489
LIAM: It's the rule!

2739
02:10:46.489 --> 02:10:49.293
SAM: The rule is I can.
MATT: The rule is he can.

2740
02:10:49.293 --> 02:10:50.847
LAURA: Come on!

2741
02:10:50.847 --> 02:10:53.115
LIAM: Addicted to story.

2742
02:10:53.115 --> 02:10:54.762
SAM: What is this? Sleight of Hand?

2743
02:10:54.762 --> 02:10:57.921
Don't worry, I've got Reliable Talent,
LAURA: But you still rolled a one.

2744
02:10:57.921 --> 02:10:58.796
SAM: I did.

2745
02:10:58.796 --> 02:11:00.955
MATT: But it was a 10 because of a Reliable Talent.

2746
02:11:00.955 --> 02:11:04.913
SAM: I know, that's up to the DM to rule, but it's--

2747
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:09.475
do I also add the plus four-- or the d4?
MATT: Yeah.

2748
02:11:09.475 --> 02:11:12.489
SAM: So it's 26 on a natural one.
MATT: On a natural one!

2749
02:11:12.489 --> 02:11:13.950
TALIESIN: Wow!

2750
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:15.989
TRAVIS: Don't worry, husband, I'll be right back.

2751
02:11:15.989 --> 02:11:17.380
ASHLEY: How?!

2752
02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:19.613
MATT: Rogues get, eventually,
an ability called Reliable Talent,

2753
02:11:19.613 --> 02:11:22.817
where they technically can't roll
lower than 10 on an ability check.

2754
02:11:22.817 --> 02:11:24.988
LIAM: Although, in campaign one, I was always--

2755
02:11:24.988 --> 02:11:28.464
I was just taking the ones when they came. I don't know why.

2756
02:11:28.464 --> 02:11:30.801
Well, it led to the walk of shame.

2757
02:11:30.801 --> 02:11:32.425
LAURA: Oh, that's amazing!

2758
02:11:32.425 --> 02:11:34.422
MATT: Well, given certain circumstances--

2759
02:11:34.422 --> 02:11:35.492
LIAM: It was the best.

2760
02:11:35.492 --> 02:11:37.870
MATT: You get to let a one go.

2761
02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:40.321
Reliable Talent is when you're intending to succeed.

2762
02:11:40.321 --> 02:11:41.154
LIAM: Yeah.

2763
02:11:42.548 --> 02:11:44.052
MATT: That's enough.

2764
02:11:44.052 --> 02:11:46.242
Carefully. You watch the box teeter

2765
02:11:46.242 --> 02:11:48.700
and almost with some of the wind that blows through,

2766
02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:49.640
it begins to teeter drops off to the side

2767
02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.964
about to fall into the water.
SAM: (yells)

2768
02:11:50.964 --> 02:11:52.231
MATT: You're like, "Ah!" You catch it,

2769
02:11:52.231 --> 02:11:56.216
bring it back, and ever so carefully (clicking) (creaking)

2770
02:11:56.216 --> 02:11:59.092
and the top lid opens up slightly as the lock itself

2771
02:11:59.092 --> 02:12:01.312
opens and sticks out slightly.

2772
02:12:01.312 --> 02:12:02.992
LAURA: Bring it over! What does it do?

2773
02:12:02.992 --> 02:12:07.745
SAM: I will bring it over and I will present it to everyone.

2774
02:12:07.745 --> 02:12:08.578
MATT: All right.

2775
02:12:08.578 --> 02:12:12.297
You look on the inside. There are some faint,

2776
02:12:12.297 --> 02:12:15.922
I want to say it's like dirt or ash that's

2777
02:12:15.922 --> 02:12:17.945
on the inside, like, an element of packing

2778
02:12:17.945 --> 02:12:20.377
what was inside, but rolled up tightly,

2779
02:12:20.377 --> 02:12:22.168
it looks like it's a piece of paper,

2780
02:12:22.168 --> 02:12:26.017
or some sort of parchment about a foot long.

2781
02:12:26.017 --> 02:12:27.107
SAM: A foot long?

2782
02:12:27.107 --> 02:12:29.802
TRAVIS: Someone was here already,
TALIESIN: Someone ordered a sandwich.

2783
02:12:29.802 --> 02:12:31.780
MATT: It's an IOU for what was in there, yeah.

2784
02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:33.396
LAURA: Should I pick it up and read it?
SAM: Yeah, read it!

2785
02:12:33.396 --> 02:12:34.885
LAURA: Do you want to read it because you bought it?

2786
02:12:34.885 --> 02:12:38.252
TALIESIN: I'm bad at public reading, so it's fine.

2787
02:12:38.252 --> 02:12:39.530
SAM: You should go to Toastmasters.

2788
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:41.629
LAURA: What does it say?
TALIESIN: Thinking about it.

2789
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:44.627
MATT: There are two scrolls in there

2790
02:12:44.627 --> 02:12:47.083
that contain two different arcane spells.

2791
02:12:47.083 --> 02:12:48.250
ALL: Whoa!

2792
02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.191
MATT: One of which is the 2nd-level spell, Flaming Sphere.

2793
02:12:54.191 --> 02:12:56.141
ALL: Ooh!

2794
02:12:56.141 --> 02:12:59.089
MATT: The second one of which is Telekinesis.

2795
02:12:59.089 --> 02:13:00.163
LAURA: Ooh!

2796
02:13:00.163 --> 02:13:01.916
SAM: Single-use scrolls?

2797
02:13:01.916 --> 02:13:04.325
MATT: Single-use.
TRAVIS: Motherfucking Telekinesis?!

2798
02:13:04.325 --> 02:13:05.642
LAURA: If he puts them in his book,

2799
02:13:05.642 --> 02:13:08.150
it's a-lot-of-use scrolls, right?

2800
02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:08.983
MATT: Yeah.

2801
02:13:08.983 --> 02:13:11.510
LIAM: Well, I know one of those, so.

2802
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:12.700
LAURA: Which one do you know?

2803
02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:15.742
LIAM: I have a Flaming Sphere in my repertoire.

2804
02:13:15.742 --> 02:13:18.210
LAURA: Do you want a fire sphere?

2805
02:13:18.210 --> 02:13:20.482
Here, you take it!
TALIESIN: I don't need a fire sphere.

2806
02:13:20.482 --> 02:13:21.315
LIAM: And only--

2807
02:13:22.656 --> 02:13:27.573
Who can use that? Only Veth and I,
or could the clerics use it?

2808
02:13:29.850 --> 02:13:33.138
MATT: Once you gain a level,
then there are some points

2809
02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:35.578
where you can choose spells from other classes.

2810
02:13:35.578 --> 02:13:37.790
You could take that one.
SAM: I mean, I can use it as a single-use whenever.

2811
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:40.192
MATT: Oh, as a single-use, you could, yeah.
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I meant.

2812
02:13:40.192 --> 02:13:42.577
TALIESIN: But we couldn't use that as single-use.

2813
02:13:42.577 --> 02:13:43.410
MATT: Um.

2814
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:45.042
ASHLEY: Can anybody?

2815
02:13:45.042 --> 02:13:47.275
MATT: I'll double check on that.
TRAVIS: ♪ Goodness gracious,

2816
02:13:47.275 --> 02:13:49.412
♪ great balls of fire ♪
LAURA: Here is your Telekinesis-ness.

2817
02:13:49.412 --> 02:13:50.258
MATT: Been a while since we've--

2818
02:13:50.258 --> 02:13:51.557
LIAM: Thank you.

2819
02:13:51.557 --> 02:13:53.090
TALIESIN: Here's a Flaming Sphere.

2820
02:13:53.090 --> 02:13:54.565
SAM: Thank you.

2821
02:13:54.565 --> 02:13:57.450
TALIESIN: Spend it all in one place.

2822
02:13:57.450 --> 02:13:58.725
MARISHA: Good buy!

2823
02:13:58.725 --> 02:14:00.261
LAURA: That was very kind of you, Caduceus!

2824
02:14:00.261 --> 02:14:01.683
TALIESIN: I mean, what else are you going to do with money?

2825
02:14:01.683 --> 02:14:03.376
MARISHA and LIAM: Goodbye.
TRAVIS: That's all I heard.

2826
02:14:03.376 --> 02:14:06.184
MARISHA: (door shutting)
TRAVIS: (low-pitched) Boop boop.

2827
02:14:07.248 --> 02:14:08.173
LIAM: Learn.

2828
02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:10.100
MATT: "If the spell is on your class' spell list."

2829
02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:10.974
So not everybody.

2830
02:14:10.974 --> 02:14:11.820
LAURA: Oh.

2831
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.398
TALIESIN: Yeah, we couldn't do it at all.
I don't think you ever (mumbling).

2832
02:14:14.398 --> 02:14:15.448
I know I don't.

2833
02:14:15.448 --> 02:14:17.665
MATT: So, technically, you could
because it is something you could pull.

2834
02:14:17.665 --> 02:14:21.382
I would allow it, given the fact that is--

2835
02:14:21.382 --> 02:14:23.132
while it's not on your initial list,

2836
02:14:23.132 --> 02:14:25.173
because at certain points you can choose any other class,

2837
02:14:25.173 --> 02:14:27.156
I'll say, since it's a one-use scroll,

2838
02:14:27.156 --> 02:14:28.183
I'd allow you to use it.

2839
02:14:28.183 --> 02:14:29.082
SAM: Okay.
MATT: Since you are

2840
02:14:29.082 --> 02:14:31.398
one who's also learning from Caleb

2841
02:14:31.398 --> 02:14:32.760
as you go along.

2842
02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:34.842
SAM: Great.
LIAM: Yeah!

2843
02:14:34.842 --> 02:14:35.675
MARISHA: Cool.

2844
02:14:37.795 --> 02:14:39.779
That's a good spell.
SAM: Good purchase.

2845
02:14:39.779 --> 02:14:42.137
LIAM: Well, once we get back to civilization

2846
02:14:42.137 --> 02:14:45.015
and I can buy some high-quality paper and ink,

2847
02:14:45.015 --> 02:14:48.262
I will be able to use that spell.

2848
02:14:48.262 --> 02:14:49.103
MATT: All righty.
LIAM: Excellent.

2849
02:14:49.103 --> 02:14:51.221
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

2850
02:14:51.221 --> 02:14:52.054
LAURA: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Ah!

2851
02:14:52.997 --> 02:14:56.222
MATT: So we'll just continue here.

2852
02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:57.973
Day one.

2853
02:14:58.822 --> 02:14:59.663
Day two.

2854
02:14:59.663 --> 02:15:01.629
If there's anything you want to do during this trip,

2855
02:15:01.629 --> 02:15:03.070
as I progress through the days,

2856
02:15:03.070 --> 02:15:05.244
MATT: jump in.
MARISHA: How's the weather looking?

2857
02:15:05.244 --> 02:15:06.678
MATT: First couple days,

2858
02:15:06.678 --> 02:15:11.066
clear, open blue skies, dotted bits of white cloud,

2859
02:15:11.066 --> 02:15:14.750
but very minimal and isolated.

2860
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:18.267
Otherwise, it's perfect sailing weather.

2861
02:15:18.267 --> 02:15:21.467
Nice and warm, the occasional ocean spray giving

2862
02:15:22.742 --> 02:15:24.783
a cool balance to that.

2863
02:15:25.913 --> 02:15:26.746
Yeah.

2864
02:15:26.746 --> 02:15:28.408
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a
pillow fort in the crow's nest.

2865
02:15:28.408 --> 02:15:31.578
LAURA: I spend a lot of time carving little figures

2866
02:15:31.578 --> 02:15:33.153
of the Traveler.

2867
02:15:33.153 --> 02:15:35.461
MATT: Okay. Cool.

2868
02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:38.523
LAURA: So many, so many little figurines of the Traveler.

2869
02:15:38.523 --> 02:15:41.917
I'm really tired of making figurines of the Traveler.

2870
02:15:41.917 --> 02:15:43.325
MATT: Fair enough.

2871
02:15:43.325 --> 02:15:46.091
Day three comes with a heavier...

2872
02:15:47.993 --> 02:15:49.677
marine layer fog

2873
02:15:49.677 --> 02:15:52.315
that hangs over a good part of the day.

2874
02:15:52.315 --> 02:15:55.470
Burns off slightly as the afternoon kicks in.

2875
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:58.726
But still, the clouds are a little more there.

2876
02:15:58.726 --> 02:16:00.383
MARISHA: I go over to Jester.

2877
02:16:01.358 --> 02:16:03.679
That's a lot of figures.

2878
02:16:03.679 --> 02:16:04.512
LAURA: Yeah.

2879
02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:06.907
I figure everybody should get one

2880
02:16:06.907 --> 02:16:09.220
when they come to the con.

2881
02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:10.653
MARISHA: It's pretty good.
LAURA: Yeah.

2882
02:16:10.653 --> 02:16:12.442
My mom, you know, whenever she hosts parties,

2883
02:16:12.442 --> 02:16:14.755
everybody gets to go home with something.

2884
02:16:14.755 --> 02:16:17.387
So I figure it would be nice.

2885
02:16:17.387 --> 02:16:20.150
MARISHA: You know, I still have this jeweler's kit.

2886
02:16:20.150 --> 02:16:23.250
I think it has some, like, leftover stuff.

2887
02:16:23.250 --> 02:16:25.310
I've just had this thing. I don't know,

2888
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:28.500
maybe we can make a few that are, like, necklaces

2889
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:32.543
or fancy ones for the high ranking members.

2890
02:16:32.543 --> 02:16:35.623
LAURA: Oh my gosh, we can use
some of the leftover jewel dust

2891
02:16:35.623 --> 02:16:38.142
and sprinkle it on some of them, make them real sparkly.

2892
02:16:38.142 --> 02:16:39.373
MARISHA: Yeah, that's dope.

2893
02:16:39.373 --> 02:16:41.598
LAURA: That's really awesome.
That is such a good idea, Beau.

2894
02:16:41.598 --> 02:16:44.042
MARISHA: I sit down and I help Jester make some

2895
02:16:44.042 --> 02:16:47.193
fancy ones and put some on chains.

2896
02:16:47.193 --> 02:16:49.527
MATT: Okay, so day three, you're helping Jester with crafts.

2897
02:16:49.527 --> 02:16:50.420
LAURA: We're crafting.

2898
02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:51.253
MATT: Fair enough.

2899
02:16:51.253 --> 02:16:54.078
TALIESIN: The best part of D&amp;D was the absence of

2900
02:16:54.078 --> 02:16:56.404
glitter in that world and you've now ruined that.

2901
02:16:56.404 --> 02:16:57.237
LAURA: Oh yeah.

2902
02:16:57.237 --> 02:16:59.173
It's like the gem dust. You can't get it off.

2903
02:16:59.173 --> 02:17:00.556
It will always be...

2904
02:17:00.556 --> 02:17:02.106
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

2905
02:17:02.106 --> 02:17:03.918
MARISHA: It's like, something got in my eye.

2906
02:17:03.918 --> 02:17:07.457
And now it looks like a kaleidoscope, everywhere I look.

2907
02:17:07.457 --> 02:17:08.517
MATT: About 10 years down the road,

2908
02:17:08.517 --> 02:17:10.937
you're just going to have this terrible growth.

2909
02:17:10.937 --> 02:17:12.495
LAURA: Yeah.

2910
02:17:12.495 --> 02:17:13.825
TRAVIS: (groans)

2911
02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:15.745
MATT: So this is going to be a number of days at sea.

2912
02:17:15.745 --> 02:17:17.043
So if there's anything you want to accomplish,

2913
02:17:17.043 --> 02:17:19.033
any conversations you want to have, any check-ins, anything.

2914
02:17:19.033 --> 02:17:21.752
You guys are a captive audience here on this boat

2915
02:17:21.752 --> 02:17:23.118
as you're watching the Armada,

2916
02:17:23.118 --> 02:17:24.459
so if there's anything you want to keep an eye out for,

2917
02:17:24.459 --> 02:17:26.750
if there's anything you want to discuss.

2918
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:28.042
Day four comes around.

2919
02:17:28.042 --> 02:17:30.425
LAURA: I make sure Sprinkle's doing good.

2920
02:17:30.425 --> 02:17:32.308
MARISHA: (laughs)

2921
02:17:32.308 --> 02:17:33.208
TALIESIN: Oh wow, I forgot!

2922
02:17:33.208 --> 02:17:34.399
LAURA: Yeah.

2923
02:17:34.399 --> 02:17:36.223
He really didn't have a
good time on the ocean before,

2924
02:17:36.223 --> 02:17:39.821
so I'm just checking every once a while to make sure.
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Give me a viking death.

2925
02:17:39.821 --> 02:17:42.489
(laughter)

2926
02:17:42.489 --> 02:17:44.723
SAM: (high-pitched) Bury me at sea.

2927
02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:46.880
TALIESIN: Keeping an eye out.
LIAM: (high-pitched) Oh look, a plank!

2928
02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.320
MATT: Sprinkle is much happier since having the bath

2929
02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:53.732
that was last given. Very unhappy being so clean at the time

2930
02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:56.143
because there was an element of, you know, natural oils

2931
02:17:56.143 --> 02:17:59.625
and stuff that keep to it, but seems to be having a better

2932
02:17:59.625 --> 02:18:03.385
time on the sea this time than the previous journey,

2933
02:18:03.385 --> 02:18:05.860
by and large. Fourth day,

2934
02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:08.373
cloud cover takes the entire day.

2935
02:18:08.373 --> 02:18:11.498
The marine layer brings with it some actual clouds,

2936
02:18:11.498 --> 02:18:14.208
nothing rain worthy, but at least the blue skies

2937
02:18:14.208 --> 02:18:16.160
for this day have faded.

2938
02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.451
MARISHA: Yasha?

2939
02:18:17.451 --> 02:18:18.293
ASHLEY: Yeah?

2940
02:18:18.293 --> 02:18:21.792
MARISHA: Can you still sense the weather and shit?

2941
02:18:21.792 --> 02:18:25.670
ASHLEY: I mean, I never really could sense the weather.

2942
02:18:25.670 --> 02:18:27.803
I think I would just...

2943
02:18:29.460 --> 02:18:34.460
I feel like the rain and lightning would sometimes find me.

2944
02:18:35.352 --> 02:18:36.807
But I don't-- you know...

2945
02:18:36.807 --> 02:18:37.890
MARISHA: Is this your fault?

2946
02:18:37.890 --> 02:18:38.913
Did you do this?

2947
02:18:38.913 --> 02:18:43.017
ASHLEY: I don't think so, but it's very possible.

2948
02:18:43.017 --> 02:18:45.095
MARISHA: Last time we were on this boat,

2949
02:18:45.095 --> 02:18:48.086
you fought an invisible,

2950
02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:50.894
like, storm monster.

2951
02:18:50.894 --> 02:18:54.612
And we all just watched. It was real crazy.

2952
02:18:54.612 --> 02:18:56.408
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was a little crazy.

2953
02:18:56.408 --> 02:18:59.523
MARISHA: I still don't know if we really could have gotten

2954
02:18:59.523 --> 02:19:03.440
that full side of the story. Do you know what that was?

2955
02:19:05.688 --> 02:19:08.596
ASHLEY: Yeah, I-- well, I mean...

2956
02:19:11.972 --> 02:19:13.463
LAURA: It was like a lightning beast.

2957
02:19:13.463 --> 02:19:15.388
ASHLEY: It was a lightning beast.

2958
02:19:17.210 --> 02:19:18.642
But I think it was...

2959
02:19:18.642 --> 02:19:19.608
TALIESIN: Very very frightening.

2960
02:19:19.608 --> 02:19:21.525
ASHLEY: It was very frightening, but I think it was sort

2961
02:19:21.525 --> 02:19:23.725
of a lesson for me

2962
02:19:23.725 --> 02:19:24.558
from...

2963
02:19:26.041 --> 02:19:27.873
the Storm Lord.

2964
02:19:27.873 --> 02:19:29.945
MARISHA: Do you think...

2965
02:19:29.945 --> 02:19:31.463
he's going to teach you any more lessons?

2966
02:19:31.463 --> 02:19:33.722
Is this, like, an ongoing course?

2967
02:19:33.722 --> 02:19:37.997
Or do you think now that you're free from Obann that...

2968
02:19:39.670 --> 02:19:40.898
you've broken away?

2969
02:19:40.898 --> 02:19:43.663
LAURA: Yeah, are you talking to him more and stuff now?

2970
02:19:43.663 --> 02:19:47.930
ASHLEY: I mean, not really. I guess I should.

2971
02:19:47.930 --> 02:19:51.183
I feel like you are so close

2972
02:19:51.183 --> 02:19:54.309
with talking with the Traveler, but...

2973
02:19:55.353 --> 02:19:57.686
I don't know if I want to be that close.

2974
02:19:57.686 --> 02:20:01.147
LAURA: Well, now we know why I am so close, you know?

2975
02:20:01.147 --> 02:20:03.395
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

2976
02:20:03.395 --> 02:20:05.770
ASHLEY: How are you feeling about that?

2977
02:20:05.770 --> 02:20:07.678
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: That's a good question.

2978
02:20:09.052 --> 02:20:10.713
LAURA: Can I be honest?

2979
02:20:10.713 --> 02:20:13.570
MARISHA: Yeah, we were just crafting.
It's the perfect time to be honest.

2980
02:20:13.570 --> 02:20:14.886
LAURA: That's true.

2981
02:20:14.886 --> 02:20:17.112
Yasha, do you want to craft?

2982
02:20:17.112 --> 02:20:18.757
MARISHA: We're making necklaces.

2983
02:20:18.757 --> 02:20:21.432
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.
LAURA: Come and sit down. Sit down.

2984
02:20:23.677 --> 02:20:25.344
ASHLEY: Just smush the clay.

2985
02:20:26.683 --> 02:20:27.926
(smushing)

2986
02:20:27.926 --> 02:20:30.499
LAURA: I don't know how I feel about it.

2987
02:20:30.499 --> 02:20:34.874
You know? Like, at first, I guess I felt a little

2988
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:41.370
betrayed, if that's the right word.

2989
02:20:41.370 --> 02:20:43.128
You know? Like,

2990
02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:47.842
I spent a long time thinking he was a god

2991
02:20:47.842 --> 02:20:50.425
and he never told me otherwise.

2992
02:20:53.075 --> 02:20:56.584
I mean, but at the end of the day, you know,

2993
02:20:57.892 --> 02:21:00.017
he's been one of my best friends.

2994
02:21:00.017 --> 02:21:03.250
He got me through a lot of really terrible times and

2995
02:21:05.342 --> 02:21:06.175
you know?

2996
02:21:08.485 --> 02:21:11.318
If this is what he needs now, then

2997
02:21:12.563 --> 02:21:14.146
then I'll help him.

2998
02:21:16.297 --> 02:21:18.816
ASHLEY: That's very nice of you.
LAURA: Yeah.

2999
02:21:18.816 --> 02:21:21.355
ASHLEY: I feel like I would have a very different reaction.

3000
02:21:21.355 --> 02:21:22.371
MARISHA: Yeah, same.

3001
02:21:23.613 --> 02:21:25.682
We're very protective of you.

3002
02:21:25.682 --> 02:21:26.531
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3003
02:21:26.531 --> 02:21:27.922
MARISHA: And defensive.

3004
02:21:29.268 --> 02:21:30.643
You know, so

3005
02:21:32.726 --> 02:21:35.309
if we ever come across as assholes,

3006
02:21:36.268 --> 02:21:37.784
it's only out of love.

3007
02:21:37.784 --> 02:21:38.617
LAURA: Aw.

3008
02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:40.580
I know that.

3009
02:21:41.913 --> 02:21:45.375
Hey, you know, I mean, and I know you think he might be

3010
02:21:45.375 --> 02:21:47.779
a little strange. I see the way you talk to him.

3011
02:21:47.779 --> 02:21:48.762
But

3012
02:21:48.762 --> 02:21:52.125
he, you know, he gives me really good powers.

3013
02:21:52.125 --> 02:21:53.445
You know, it's not like,

3014
02:21:53.445 --> 02:21:54.980
I'm just like worshiping this guy

3015
02:21:54.980 --> 02:21:56.775
and he's just like, "Yeah."

3016
02:21:56.775 --> 02:21:58.810
He's, like, "Okay, yeah, here's a whole bunch of

3017
02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:01.095
"really cool spells."

3018
02:22:01.095 --> 02:22:03.810
ASHLEY: So he, yeah, but

3019
02:22:03.810 --> 02:22:08.810
you were saying I feel like a lot of that power is in you.

3020
02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:14.082
I mean, how much of that is he actually giving you?

3021
02:22:14.082 --> 02:22:16.188
I mean, don't you already just have it?

3022
02:22:16.188 --> 02:22:17.021
LAURA: I don't--

3023
02:22:19.442 --> 02:22:22.367
I don't know how that works. I don't remember--

3024
02:22:25.651 --> 02:22:28.667
I don't remember being able to do anything fun

3025
02:22:28.667 --> 02:22:31.085
like that before I met him.

3026
02:22:31.085 --> 02:22:34.221
But, to be honest, I've never really tried.

3027
02:22:34.221 --> 02:22:35.054
MARISHA: Hmm.

3028
02:22:36.415 --> 02:22:39.105
Maybe he just showed you the path.

3029
02:22:39.105 --> 02:22:44.096
LAURA: Maybe, but isn't that enough?
If he woke it up in me, then.

3030
02:22:46.823 --> 02:22:47.990
MARISHA: I think it's

3031
02:22:49.195 --> 02:22:51.362
nice to acknowledge it.

3032
02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:54.728
But, you know, give yourself some credit, too

3033
02:22:54.728 --> 02:22:56.685
for the accomplishments that you've made

3034
02:22:56.685 --> 02:22:58.577
completely on your own.

3035
02:22:59.574 --> 02:23:01.610
LAURA: That's true, I did design some really good clothes.

3036
02:23:01.610 --> 02:23:03.723
Well, that wasn't on my own. That was with Caduceus.

3037
02:23:03.723 --> 02:23:06.598
He is really stylish.

3038
02:23:06.598 --> 02:23:10.131
MARISHA: Yeah. Thank you for my suit. That was great.

3039
02:23:10.131 --> 02:23:12.150
ASHLEY: That suit was pretty cool. Thank you for the dress.

3040
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:13.275
I really liked it.

3041
02:23:13.275 --> 02:23:16.046
The slit was very high, but.

3042
02:23:16.046 --> 02:23:17.911
MARISHA: You looked great.
LAURA: You've got really good legs, Yasha.

3043
02:23:17.911 --> 02:23:19.518
I just wanted to show them off.
ASHLEY: Oh, thanks!

3044
02:23:19.518 --> 02:23:21.343
Well, I mean, it's--

3045
02:23:21.343 --> 02:23:23.983
it helped with moving around, you know?

3046
02:23:23.983 --> 02:23:25.291
LAURA: Yeah. Plus, I mean,
MARISHA: Mm!

3047
02:23:25.291 --> 02:23:26.958
LAURA: -- too, in my defense,

3048
02:23:26.958 --> 02:23:28.741
I kind of underestimated your height,

3049
02:23:28.741 --> 02:23:32.610
so I was thinking the slit would be a little lower on you.

3050
02:23:32.610 --> 02:23:35.675
ASHLEY: Yeah, because it did go way up here. It's fine.

3051
02:23:35.675 --> 02:23:37.390
LAURA: It's a good thing you don't wear underwear!

3052
02:23:37.390 --> 02:23:38.498
ASHLEY: Yeah, no, I know!

3053
02:23:38.498 --> 02:23:39.920
LIAM: Canon.

3054
02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:41.806
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

3055
02:23:41.806 --> 02:23:42.639
SAM: Fire?

3056
02:23:45.439 --> 02:23:48.435
TRAVIS: No, no! No!

3057
02:23:48.435 --> 02:23:50.260
SAM: Ready?!
TRAVIS: No!

3058
02:23:52.450 --> 02:23:55.078
ASHLEY: I take a little bite of the clay.

3059
02:23:55.078 --> 02:23:57.420
LAURA: Oh, that's not-- it's not probably not very tasty.

3060
02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:59.752
ASHLEY: But I heard sometimes it tastes a little salty.

3061
02:23:59.752 --> 02:24:02.245
MARISHA: Yeah, what it taste like? Is it good?

3062
02:24:02.245 --> 02:24:05.293
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's, like, it's a little salty, you know.

3063
02:24:05.293 --> 02:24:07.640
LAURA: It's like mud?
ASHLEY: Did you ever try it?

3064
02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:09.074
MARISHA: I try a little corner.

3065
02:24:09.074 --> 02:24:10.899
LAURA: I try it.

3066
02:24:10.899 --> 02:24:13.757
TALIESIN: We're at sea, everything's salty.
TRAVIS: No!

3067
02:24:14.757 --> 02:24:17.583
LAURA: Tastes like--

3068
02:24:17.583 --> 02:24:19.380
MARISHA: I do feel like I was, like, my, you know,

3069
02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:21.558
we've been on the ocean so, like, my, you know,

3070
02:24:21.558 --> 02:24:24.720
electrolytes are a little depleted. That's kind of nice.

3071
02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:26.470
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: I don't like it.

3072
02:24:26.470 --> 02:24:27.553
I don't like it!

3073
02:24:27.553 --> 02:24:29.615
MARISHA: Hmm.
ASHLEY: You can split it out.

3074
02:24:29.615 --> 02:24:32.115
(laughter)

3075
02:24:32.115 --> 02:24:33.977
Mush it back in.

3076
02:24:33.977 --> 02:24:36.638
This will be a <i>very</i> special one.

3077
02:24:36.638 --> 02:24:38.912
Whoever get this one.

3078
02:24:38.912 --> 02:24:40.795
MARISHA: What about you, Yasha?

3079
02:24:42.535 --> 02:24:43.784
ASHLEY: What about me?

3080
02:24:43.784 --> 02:24:46.282
LAURA: Deflection, deflection, deflection.

3081
02:24:46.282 --> 02:24:50.200
ASHLEY: I don't like talking about myself very much, but.

3082
02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:51.840
LAURA: No, but really, okay, so.

3083
02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:53.902
Before we left, Caleb mentioned the thing, like,

3084
02:24:53.902 --> 02:24:56.985
he made a joke of it, of you in the pit.

3085
02:24:56.985 --> 02:25:00.268
But it's not really a joke, is it?

3086
02:25:03.232 --> 02:25:05.452
ASHLEY: I mean, I thought

3087
02:25:05.452 --> 02:25:08.868
maybe I would feel better after that,

3088
02:25:08.868 --> 02:25:10.543
but it didn't--

3089
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:13.563
it didn't really help.

3090
02:25:13.563 --> 02:25:18.563
Like, I think it was only satisfying
for a very brief moment.

3091
02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:22.707
And, I guess, maybe I thought that

3092
02:25:25.333 --> 02:25:26.500
maybe I should--

3093
02:25:29.638 --> 02:25:32.717
I don't know, that's a little dark, but.

3094
02:25:32.717 --> 02:25:34.117
LAURA: You should what?

3095
02:25:36.292 --> 02:25:38.534
ASHLEY: I think because I'm--

3096
02:25:40.962 --> 02:25:43.650
I don't know, I guess I thought maybe I should just die

3097
02:25:43.650 --> 02:25:47.233
for every person that I've killed or something.

3098
02:25:49.975 --> 02:25:52.941
But that's obviously not going to help anything.

3099
02:25:52.941 --> 02:25:54.524
LAURA: It won't, because,

3100
02:25:58.007 --> 02:25:58.840
you know,

3101
02:26:00.265 --> 02:26:03.508
think of all the good you're going to be able to do now.

3102
02:26:03.508 --> 02:26:07.342
If you died, it would just end with the bad.

3103
02:26:09.025 --> 02:26:09.858
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3104
02:26:11.917 --> 02:26:15.642
All you guys are very wonderful and

3105
02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:19.767
have made me feel

3106
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:23.750
a lot better about the choices that I've made

3107
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:26.983
and some of the choices that I have not made.

3108
02:26:30.485 --> 02:26:33.318
MARISHA: That must be a weird experience.

3109
02:26:35.016 --> 02:26:36.892
A lot of people,

3110
02:26:36.892 --> 02:26:39.979
you know, kind of like the issue with Essek,

3111
02:26:39.979 --> 02:26:43.431
he consciously made a lot of those choices.

3112
02:26:43.431 --> 02:26:44.343
LAURA: Yeah.

3113
02:26:44.343 --> 02:26:45.176
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3114
02:26:46.018 --> 02:26:50.185
MARISHA: That's not you, there is a big difference.

3115
02:26:51.989 --> 02:26:52.822
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3116
02:26:54.388 --> 02:26:56.721
I think so, but still, it's

3117
02:26:57.810 --> 02:27:01.477
a hard thing to try to forgive yourself for.

3118
02:27:04.347 --> 02:27:06.708
I hurt you pretty bad,

3119
02:27:06.708 --> 02:27:09.595
and that makes me feel very, very terrible.

3120
02:27:09.595 --> 02:27:14.595
MARISHA: Oh, that, pfft. (stammering)

3121
02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:17.135
Don't worry, don't worry about it.

3122
02:27:17.135 --> 02:27:19.740
(laughter)

3123
02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:22.283
LAURA: Plus, her scars look pretty cool.

3124
02:27:22.283 --> 02:27:25.352
MARISHA: Yeah, it just, like, it just adds to my aesthetic.

3125
02:27:25.352 --> 02:27:27.603
It's great. It makes me a little bit more interesting

3126
02:27:27.603 --> 02:27:29.020
of a person.

3127
02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:31.798
ASHLEY: I mean, you're already very, very interesting.

3128
02:27:31.798 --> 02:27:34.920
You're both very interesting.

3129
02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:36.678
Like, you know.

3130
02:27:39.799 --> 02:27:42.198
MARISHA: What do you think will help make you feel better?

3131
02:27:42.198 --> 02:27:43.031
You know?

3132
02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:49.610
ASHLEY: I don't know yet.

3133
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:50.443
I mean,

3134
02:27:52.437 --> 02:27:56.090
I think just being around you guys has been

3135
02:27:56.090 --> 02:27:57.298
help in itself.

3136
02:27:59.022 --> 02:28:02.189
But I guess I'll find that out. I mean,

3137
02:28:03.967 --> 02:28:07.833
I've seen so many things that I never thought I would see.

3138
02:28:07.833 --> 02:28:09.337
LAURA: Like the ocean?

3139
02:28:09.337 --> 02:28:10.513
ASHLEY: Yeah!

3140
02:28:10.513 --> 02:28:12.899
MARISHA: I've really missed it.

3141
02:28:12.899 --> 02:28:14.399
I'm not going to lie.

3142
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:18.602
I really like being on the boat.

3143
02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:20.948
LAURA: Maybe when everything's done,

3144
02:28:20.948 --> 02:28:23.781
you can be a pirate for real!

3145
02:28:23.781 --> 02:28:27.703
Or, you know, an actual ship captain.

3146
02:28:27.703 --> 02:28:29.845
MARISHA: But, like, a spy pirate.

3147
02:28:29.845 --> 02:28:31.260
How awesome is that?!

3148
02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:32.809
LAURA: Spy pirate is pretty cool.
LIAM: Spirate.

3149
02:28:32.809 --> 02:28:33.858
MARISHA: Yeah,

3150
02:28:33.858 --> 02:28:38.858
I can still, you know, work with the Cobalt Reserve, but--

3151
02:28:38.867 --> 02:28:40.312
ASHLEY: On the sea?

3152
02:28:40.312 --> 02:28:43.049
MARISHA: Yeah, an international waters branch.

3153
02:28:43.049 --> 02:28:45.988
LAURA: Ooh!
ASHLEY: That'd be pretty cool.

3154
02:28:45.988 --> 02:28:47.590
Yeah.

3155
02:28:47.590 --> 02:28:48.423
MARISHA: Hmm.

3156
02:28:49.717 --> 02:28:51.779
I think this one's going to be mine.

3157
02:28:51.779 --> 02:28:52.612
LAURA: Oh!

3158
02:28:53.452 --> 02:28:55.250
That's, like, really big, Beau.

3159
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:57.670
MARISHA: I deliberately made it huge.

3160
02:28:57.670 --> 02:29:01.832
LAURA: You're going to be almost the highest priestess.

3161
02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:04.536
MARISHA: Oh, is it, like, based on size? Oh.

3162
02:29:04.536 --> 02:29:05.678
LAURA: I mean, I'm not going to have--

3163
02:29:05.678 --> 02:29:07.122
mine's just going to real sparkly.

3164
02:29:07.122 --> 02:29:08.539
I'm working on it.

3165
02:29:09.922 --> 02:29:12.028
MARISHA: Because I don't want to, like, inflate my position

3166
02:29:12.028 --> 02:29:14.218
if, like, the bigger means like--
LAURA: No, no, no. You guys,

3167
02:29:14.218 --> 02:29:17.782
we're all going to be super high priests and priestesses.

3168
02:29:17.782 --> 02:29:20.977
ASHLEY: This is becoming such a performance.

3169
02:29:20.977 --> 02:29:21.957
It's fun.

3170
02:29:21.957 --> 02:29:24.752
LAURA: I'm not exactly sure what we're doing yet, but

3171
02:29:24.752 --> 02:29:27.611
it'll present itself on the day, yeah.
ASHLEY: It'll be pretty great.

3172
02:29:27.611 --> 02:29:28.903
Wait, Nott!

3173
02:29:28.903 --> 02:29:30.589
SAM: Oy!
LAURA: Veth.

3174
02:29:30.589 --> 02:29:32.046
ASHLEY: Veth.
SAM: Oh.

3175
02:29:32.046 --> 02:29:33.713
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, it's just habit.

3176
02:29:33.713 --> 02:29:37.353
SAM: Yeah. No, that's fair. It'll take me a while, too.

3177
02:29:37.353 --> 02:29:40.005
ASHLEY: I-- do you--

3178
02:29:40.005 --> 02:29:42.528
Do you know how to swim?

3179
02:29:42.528 --> 02:29:44.073
SAM: Ah, no.

3180
02:29:44.073 --> 02:29:45.766
ASHLEY: Oh, we need to fix that.

3181
02:29:45.766 --> 02:29:47.316
SAM: Nope!

3182
02:29:47.316 --> 02:29:49.865
No, we don't need to.

3183
02:29:49.865 --> 02:29:54.127
MARISHA: I gave her, like, one lesson once and she, like,

3184
02:29:54.127 --> 02:29:56.559
never came back to do it again.

3185
02:29:56.559 --> 02:29:58.411
Maybe you'll do better.

3186
02:29:58.411 --> 02:30:00.025
SAM: Do you know how to swim?

3187
02:30:00.025 --> 02:30:01.150
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3188
02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:02.325
SAM: Where did you learn?

3189
02:30:02.325 --> 02:30:04.130
LAURA: Yeah, how did you learn how to swim?

3190
02:30:04.130 --> 02:30:07.288
ASHLEY: There's, you know, some

3191
02:30:08.146 --> 02:30:10.204
bodies of water

3192
02:30:10.204 --> 02:30:13.915
up there. We would have to bathe and things like that.

3193
02:30:16.039 --> 02:30:18.090
Not super deep or anything like that,

3194
02:30:18.090 --> 02:30:20.000
but I know how to float.

3195
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:23.685
I know how to get from one side to the other.

3196
02:30:23.685 --> 02:30:24.602
And I could teach you.

3197
02:30:24.602 --> 02:30:26.728
SAM: Do you know different, different strokes?

3198
02:30:26.728 --> 02:30:29.550
LAURA: I know different strokes.
ASHLEY: For different folks? Yeah.

3199
02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:31.720
SAM: Whatchu talkin' 'bout?

3200
02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:34.519
(laughter)

3201
02:30:36.286 --> 02:30:39.893
SAM: I mean, when would I need to know that, though?

3202
02:30:39.893 --> 02:30:42.283
And why would I need to know all that?

3203
02:30:42.283 --> 02:30:45.555
LAURA: What if we get in a big
pirate battle and our ship sinks

3204
02:30:45.555 --> 02:30:48.451
and then we're in the ocean?
SAM: I can walk on water.

3205
02:30:48.451 --> 02:30:51.408
LAURA: What if your ring falls off?
What if your hand explodes off?

3206
02:30:51.408 --> 02:30:53.109
SAM: Ahh!

3207
02:30:53.109 --> 02:30:56.617
LAURA: It could happen. I almost lost both my hands.
ASHLEY: It's just good to know how.

3208
02:30:59.067 --> 02:31:00.525
LAURA: (silly sound)

3209
02:31:02.177 --> 02:31:05.285
SAM: Well, I guess if we dock somewhere,

3210
02:31:06.357 --> 02:31:09.460
you could teach me a lesson.

3211
02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:10.293
ASHLEY: Okay.

3212
02:31:10.293 --> 02:31:12.610
SAM: I wouldn't mind-- I guess I wouldn't mind learning.

3213
02:31:12.610 --> 02:31:14.680
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think it would
be really good for you to know

3214
02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:17.172
how to swim, just in case.

3215
02:31:17.172 --> 02:31:20.750
SAM: Fjord, would you-- Fjord! I'm sorry. Captain!

3216
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:22.125
Captain Tusktooth.

3217
02:31:22.125 --> 02:31:23.291
TRAVIS: Oh! Yes?

3218
02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:26.412
SAM: Powder Monkey Veth here.

3219
02:31:27.550 --> 02:31:30.603
If I were to do a swimming lesson,

3220
02:31:30.603 --> 02:31:33.967
would you control the water around me

3221
02:31:33.967 --> 02:31:37.087
and sort of make it so that I can't drown?

3222
02:31:37.087 --> 02:31:38.977
TRAVIS: Absolutely not. It's sink or swim,

3223
02:31:38.977 --> 02:31:41.858
but what I would do is allow you to breathe underwater

3224
02:31:41.858 --> 02:31:44.469
just in case things weren't going your way.

3225
02:31:44.469 --> 02:31:45.302
ASHLEY: No.

3226
02:31:46.314 --> 02:31:47.975
SAM: What do you mean, "No"?

3227
02:31:47.975 --> 02:31:52.275
ASHLEY: How are you going to learn if you have help?

3228
02:31:52.275 --> 02:31:54.660
You have to learn how to do it yourself.

3229
02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:57.030
LAURA: But at least, you know,

3230
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:59.372
it will teach her how to move in the water.

3231
02:31:59.372 --> 02:32:02.747
TRAVIS: There's a fair difference between-- well, I mean,

3232
02:32:02.747 --> 02:32:04.850
at port is not so bad, actually.

3233
02:32:04.850 --> 02:32:07.633
What, are we throwing her out on a rope behind the ship?

3234
02:32:07.633 --> 02:32:08.471
SAM: No!

3235
02:32:08.471 --> 02:32:10.345
TRAVIS: While we're moving? Is that what you want to do?

3236
02:32:10.345 --> 02:32:12.520
SAM: Sounds like torture.
TRAVIS: I think it's a great idea.

3237
02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:14.452
TALIESIN: I was just coming by. Did
someone say they needed rope?

3238
02:32:14.452 --> 02:32:16.877
I've got so much rope. We doing something?

3239
02:32:16.877 --> 02:32:17.943
LAURA: No, we're not doing that.

3240
02:32:17.943 --> 02:32:20.380
TALIESIN: I'm going to go back to playing with the wheel.

3241
02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:22.873
MARISHA: Wait! Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Oy! Rope?

3242
02:32:22.873 --> 02:32:24.515
MARISHA: I want to help you make some tea.

3243
02:32:24.515 --> 02:32:25.348
TALIESIN: Okay.

3244
02:32:25.348 --> 02:32:27.589
MARISHA: (shouts) Caleb?
LIAM: (quietly) Hmm?

3245
02:32:27.589 --> 02:32:29.355
MARISHA: (still shouting) Were you napping?

3246
02:32:29.355 --> 02:32:31.741
LIAM: No, I'm standing three feet away from you.

3247
02:32:31.741 --> 02:32:33.812
(laughter)

3248
02:32:33.812 --> 02:32:35.376
MARISHA: (normal volume) Do you want some tea?

3249
02:32:35.376 --> 02:32:36.930
LIAM: Of course I want some tea. Thank you.

3250
02:32:36.930 --> 02:32:38.520
MARISHA: I'm going to go help Caduceus make tea.

3251
02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:39.645
MATT: All righty.

3252
02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:44.763
SAM: We'll table the swim lessons for now.

3253
02:32:44.763 --> 02:32:46.160
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3254
02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:48.331
TALIESIN: This is the weirdest metaphor
for learning how to drive

3255
02:32:48.331 --> 02:32:49.717
stick shift I've ever sat through.

3256
02:32:49.717 --> 02:32:51.677
(laughter)

3257
02:32:51.677 --> 02:32:53.580
You never know.

3258
02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:55.943
LIAM: I walk over to where the captain is.

3259
02:32:55.943 --> 02:32:57.030
MATT: All right.

3260
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:58.030
LIAM: (clears throat)

3261
02:32:58.957 --> 02:33:00.407
Captain.

3262
02:33:01.537 --> 02:33:03.503
TRAVIS: What is your position on this ship?

3263
02:33:03.503 --> 02:33:04.637
What do you...?

3264
02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:07.040
LIAM: I am the navigator.

3265
02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:09.315
TRAVIS: Navigator.

3266
02:33:09.315 --> 02:33:10.940
Oh, that's right, you know where the fuck you

3267
02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:12.085
are at all times.

3268
02:33:12.085 --> 02:33:13.143
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yes?

3269
02:33:13.143 --> 02:33:16.411
LIAM: What is this part of the ship called again?

3270
02:33:16.411 --> 02:33:18.040
TRAVIS: Where are we?

3271
02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:19.163
LIAM: At the front?

3272
02:33:19.163 --> 02:33:21.394
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is the bow.

3273
02:33:21.394 --> 02:33:22.227
LIAM: The bow.

3274
02:33:23.161 --> 02:33:23.994
Good to know.

3275
02:33:24.913 --> 02:33:26.121
TRAVIS: Is that right? I think that's right.

3276
02:33:26.121 --> 02:33:27.899
(laughter)

3277
02:33:27.899 --> 02:33:29.470
MATT: That is correct.

3278
02:33:29.470 --> 02:33:30.303
LIAM: You know, despite your--

3279
02:33:30.303 --> 02:33:33.461
TRAVIS: ♪ The bow of a ship headed for a new land! ♪

3280
02:33:34.728 --> 02:33:38.340
LIAM: Despite your act as nervousness about shipping terms

3281
02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:43.010
right now, I can't help but notice that you seem

3282
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:46.210
more at ease out here.

3283
02:33:48.305 --> 02:33:49.230
TRAVIS: A little bit.

3284
02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:50.797
LIAM: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3285
02:33:50.797 --> 02:33:54.580
I mean, it helps that you all know a little bit more.

3286
02:33:55.795 --> 02:33:58.945
I don't quite feel the pressure to pretend like I know

3287
02:33:58.945 --> 02:34:00.207
everything because I don't

3288
02:34:00.207 --> 02:34:04.523
and we've all leaned on each other rather well so yeah.

3289
02:34:05.642 --> 02:34:07.200
LIAM: You are very...

3290
02:34:08.083 --> 02:34:09.590
different

3291
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:11.757
than when I first met you.

3292
02:34:14.137 --> 02:34:15.387
Accent aside.

3293
02:34:15.387 --> 02:34:18.805
TRAVIS: That's fair. That's fair.

3294
02:34:18.805 --> 02:34:21.470
LIAM: It's curious to me because,

3295
02:34:21.470 --> 02:34:24.597
you know, we are sailing off to something very intense

3296
02:34:24.597 --> 02:34:25.430
and

3297
02:34:26.967 --> 02:34:30.666
Beauregard and I and Veth have very

3298
02:34:30.666 --> 02:34:33.891
personal stakes in this and...

3299
02:34:36.317 --> 02:34:39.800
Caduceus is here because he sees some sort of

3300
02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:42.883
grand plan in everything we do.

3301
02:34:45.210 --> 02:34:48.929
Jester is like the glue of this

3302
02:34:48.929 --> 02:34:51.229
group of weirdos that we are

3303
02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:53.745
and Yasha

3304
02:34:54.859 --> 02:34:58.617
I have never met anyone who craved a family so much.

3305
02:35:00.649 --> 02:35:02.415
But, you...

3306
02:35:06.037 --> 02:35:08.860
You know, I brought up the other day

3307
02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:11.305
that sword you held up to my neck.

3308
02:35:11.305 --> 02:35:12.138
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3309
02:35:14.055 --> 02:35:15.747
LIAM: That seems so long ago.

3310
02:35:16.908 --> 02:35:20.955
I was very untrustworthy. I <i>am</i> very untrustworthy.

3311
02:35:20.955 --> 02:35:24.730
You were you were founded in your actions that day, but...

3312
02:35:26.917 --> 02:35:28.909
you are far more--

3313
02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:32.957
you were darker then and

3314
02:35:34.690 --> 02:35:36.654
this new place you're in.

3315
02:35:36.654 --> 02:35:39.237
I know you're still finding your footing, but

3316
02:35:41.352 --> 02:35:43.252
it is admirable.

3317
02:35:45.083 --> 02:35:48.757
What you're doing, you're here out in the middle of nowhere,

3318
02:35:48.757 --> 02:35:53.006
trying to help broker peace between two countries

3319
02:35:53.006 --> 02:35:54.847
neither of which you are from.

3320
02:35:56.203 --> 02:35:59.020
And we'd like to think of Caduceus as the only--

3321
02:36:00.827 --> 02:36:03.660
as the most selfless in our party.

3322
02:36:05.385 --> 02:36:07.535
But you're no slouch yourself.

3323
02:36:09.728 --> 02:36:11.812
TRAVIS: Thank you. That means a lot.

3324
02:36:14.542 --> 02:36:19.391
I realize darker is probably a very apt term. I would--

3325
02:36:21.188 --> 02:36:24.240
I would probably call it more full of it.

3326
02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:27.823
That sword and everything that came with it

3327
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:30.697
was really the first

3328
02:36:32.073 --> 02:36:35.403
sense of control I've had in my life,

3329
02:36:35.403 --> 02:36:37.470
or the ability to control others

3330
02:36:37.470 --> 02:36:41.304
or even just affect a situation and

3331
02:36:43.247 --> 02:36:44.707
I think with a little bit of reflection,

3332
02:36:44.707 --> 02:36:47.683
I'm starting to realize that

3333
02:36:47.683 --> 02:36:50.033
maybe I thought that the way to

3334
02:36:51.242 --> 02:36:52.950
enforce or

3335
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:57.942
shepherd others was through darkness or force or threats.

3336
02:36:59.790 --> 02:37:02.706
LIAM: Control is a tempting thing.

3337
02:37:02.706 --> 02:37:03.989
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3338
02:37:03.989 --> 02:37:05.962
It didn't feel good.

3339
02:37:07.627 --> 02:37:11.968
I stopped you in that moment and then I felt terrible.

3340
02:37:11.968 --> 02:37:14.588
I didn't know if that meant that control

3341
02:37:14.588 --> 02:37:16.008
meant feeling terrible all the time

3342
02:37:16.008 --> 02:37:18.715
or if there was something wrong with the way that

3343
02:37:18.715 --> 02:37:20.881
that exchange went.

3344
02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:26.640
That and a million other things led to me

3345
02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:29.477
realizing I don't have to do things that way,

3346
02:37:29.477 --> 02:37:33.843
I don't have to do things in the way that were done to me.

3347
02:37:34.898 --> 02:37:36.481
LIAM: I understand you.

3348
02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:40.558
TRAVIS: Of course you do.

3349
02:37:40.558 --> 02:37:41.974
Of course you do.

3350
02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:44.670
I don't know if I, um...

3351
02:37:45.710 --> 02:37:49.486
if I'm more comfortable if maybe I just care a bit less

3352
02:37:49.486 --> 02:37:52.911
and I think that's the better place for me to be.

3353
02:37:54.112 --> 02:37:55.335
I don't know if I'll ever be comfortable

3354
02:37:55.335 --> 02:37:56.827
with any of this, but

3355
02:37:58.127 --> 02:37:58.960
small

3356
02:38:00.118 --> 02:38:01.552
things help.

3357
02:38:02.705 --> 02:38:05.940
Watching over you in Rexxentrum, making sure that

3358
02:38:07.073 --> 02:38:12.073
Jester can do whatever she needs to do with this entity.

3359
02:38:12.748 --> 02:38:14.510
Watching Beau go back to her family,

3360
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:17.793
watching Yasha come back, watching Veth.

3361
02:38:19.350 --> 02:38:22.566
This is more life than I ever thought I would see.

3362
02:38:22.566 --> 02:38:25.749
Every day is like a new page

3363
02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:28.622
in what I thought was going to be a terribly

3364
02:38:28.622 --> 02:38:32.997
boring and repetitive book and it's not. So...

3365
02:38:34.947 --> 02:38:35.780
Yeah.

3366
02:38:38.136 --> 02:38:39.236
LIAM: You know,

3367
02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:45.153
these people that we are dealing with. My people.

3368
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:50.612
There are good people in the Empire, but

3369
02:38:52.345 --> 02:38:54.070
these are not them.

3370
02:38:55.993 --> 02:38:57.576
They are dangerous.

3371
02:38:58.595 --> 02:38:59.837
And you are

3372
02:39:01.948 --> 02:39:03.314
selflessly

3373
02:39:04.302 --> 02:39:06.700
putting yourself in a very dangerous spot

3374
02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:08.492
for very bad people.

3375
02:39:11.701 --> 02:39:12.534
I...

3376
02:39:14.095 --> 02:39:16.020
I was one of them, Fjord.

3377
02:39:18.017 --> 02:39:21.290
He sort of grips the railing the ship

3378
02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:22.123
and looks to

3379
02:39:22.123 --> 02:39:24.513
see where everybody else is.

3380
02:39:24.513 --> 02:39:26.677
Particularly Jester,

3381
02:39:26.677 --> 02:39:30.243
and when he realizes that they're well enough away--

3382
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:34.797
A long time ago you asked me

3383
02:39:36.815 --> 02:39:38.148
about myself

3384
02:39:39.572 --> 02:39:41.739
and I just never answered.

3385
02:39:44.670 --> 02:39:47.087
I value this family, Fjord,

3386
02:39:49.430 --> 02:39:51.638
because I killed my own,

3387
02:39:54.918 --> 02:39:58.377
for these people that we are going to deal with.

3388
02:39:59.630 --> 02:40:01.047
You understand me?

3389
02:40:05.235 --> 02:40:06.352
My own.

3390
02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:13.149
And um... I'm ruined.

3391
02:40:15.470 --> 02:40:16.303
But...

3392
02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:21.797
I take comfort in the fact that I have a chance to do

3393
02:40:21.797 --> 02:40:24.321
something to make up for it.

3394
02:40:25.925 --> 02:40:29.380
And I'm very grateful for these people.

3395
02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:31.920
And you. You're a good friend

3396
02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:35.100
and I felt like that needed to be said out loud.

3397
02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:36.850
I'm glad you're here.

3398
02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:45.888
TRAVIS: I admit I can't even begin to fathom what you're

3399
02:40:45.888 --> 02:40:48.513
experiencing all this must be like.

3400
02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:54.357
I never knew my family and whatever story I tell myself

3401
02:40:54.357 --> 02:40:57.032
about them in no way compares to

3402
02:40:58.010 --> 02:41:01.382
what I know you have gone through.

3403
02:41:01.382 --> 02:41:02.615
I know that.

3404
02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:08.013
You are a good friend.

3405
02:41:09.098 --> 02:41:12.948
I know you've done terrible things, but I see a good man.

3406
02:41:12.948 --> 02:41:13.781
I do.

3407
02:41:15.026 --> 02:41:18.530
It's part of the reason I decided to just try

3408
02:41:18.530 --> 02:41:21.780
and be one myself and not someone else.

3409
02:41:24.612 --> 02:41:27.690
You and I have very similar journeys

3410
02:41:27.690 --> 02:41:30.440
and vastly different backgrounds.

3411
02:41:34.850 --> 02:41:36.141
These people,

3412
02:41:37.743 --> 02:41:38.952
your people,

3413
02:41:41.437 --> 02:41:45.553
have we even scratched the surface of what they can do?

3414
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:51.037
LIAM: I really don't think so.

3415
02:41:52.041 --> 02:41:54.291
TRAVIS: What are they waiting for?

3416
02:41:58.610 --> 02:42:01.360
LIAM: The moment where they can ascend.

3417
02:42:04.067 --> 02:42:07.013
TRAVIS: Do you think they mean to empower the Empire,

3418
02:42:07.013 --> 02:42:09.938
raise it above the Dynasty, or is there

3419
02:42:09.938 --> 02:42:13.113
a chance that they are trying to do more?

3420
02:42:14.745 --> 02:42:17.192
LIAM: It is definitely to raise the power of the Empire

3421
02:42:17.192 --> 02:42:19.167
for they <i>are</i> the Empire.

3422
02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:24.304
But my teacher...

3423
02:42:26.650 --> 02:42:29.275
They serve a king, but

3424
02:42:30.452 --> 02:42:32.202
they serve themselves.

3425
02:42:34.672 --> 02:42:36.305
They always have.

3426
02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:39.910
They will do anything

3427
02:42:40.857 --> 02:42:44.860
to maintain and improve their position.

3428
02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:48.130
TRAVIS: They certainly don't seem
to be the tightest of groups.

3429
02:42:48.130 --> 02:42:49.972
Seems to be some small fracturing.

3430
02:42:49.972 --> 02:42:54.614
LIAM: No, and even one or two in the pack who are

3431
02:42:56.791 --> 02:42:57.891
fine,

3432
02:43:01.498 --> 02:43:03.898
but the Martinet is dangerous.

3433
02:43:04.998 --> 02:43:06.798
Ikithon is dangerous.

3434
02:43:09.107 --> 02:43:11.674
So are my old friends.

3435
02:43:15.418 --> 02:43:18.730
TRAVIS: You know, in my town when a
terrible storm would come in,

3436
02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:21.230
it wasn't because you could see it or feel it.

3437
02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:24.738
Sometimes, it was just noticing the animals around you

3438
02:43:24.738 --> 02:43:26.773
starting to act differently.

3439
02:43:27.963 --> 02:43:31.790
I keep an eye on you when we're around these people.

3440
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:33.832
I have no idea what they're capable of

3441
02:43:33.832 --> 02:43:35.373
or what the signs are.

3442
02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:41.112
If your eyes are on them, our eyes are on you.

3443
02:43:46.668 --> 02:43:49.418
LIAM: I will try not to let you down.

3444
02:43:50.996 --> 02:43:52.271
TRAVIS: We're behind you.

3445
02:43:56.521 --> 02:43:59.890
LIAM: Do you remember when we almost sank our own ship?

3446
02:43:59.890 --> 02:44:01.252
TRAVIS: Which time?

3447
02:44:01.252 --> 02:44:04.587
(soft laughter)

3448
02:44:04.587 --> 02:44:05.628
LIAM: Good point.

3449
02:44:06.523 --> 02:44:08.603
MARISHA: Caleb, tea.

3450
02:44:08.603 --> 02:44:11.213
Fjord, tea.
TRAVIS: What?

3451
02:44:11.213 --> 02:44:12.046
MARISHA: There you go.
TRAVIS: I didn't ask for--

3452
02:44:12.046 --> 02:44:13.404
MARISHA: We just made a bunch. Don't worry about it.

3453
02:44:13.404 --> 02:44:15.821
LIAM: Like civilized people.

3454
02:44:15.821 --> 02:44:17.738
TRAVIS: What is that smell?

3455
02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:23.480
MARISHA: Ask Caduceus.

3456
02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.338
TRAVIS: Oh, I-- I will.

3457
02:44:28.632 --> 02:44:30.318
TALIESIN: It's saffron and mushroom. Why?

3458
02:44:30.318 --> 02:44:31.493
TRAVIS: No, it's lovely.

3459
02:44:31.493 --> 02:44:33.051
MATT: (chuckles)

3460
02:44:33.928 --> 02:44:36.553
LIAM: Is this made from anyone you knew?

3461
02:44:37.434 --> 02:44:38.267
TALIESIN: Uhh.

3462
02:44:39.665 --> 02:44:44.106
No, I can definitely-- I mean, not personally, no.

3463
02:44:45.922 --> 02:44:48.432
TALIESIN: I mean, definitely somebody that I buried.

3464
02:44:48.432 --> 02:44:50.457
That's what I carry, but I didn't actually know.

3465
02:44:50.457 --> 02:44:54.619
They came dead to the temple.
LIAM: (chokes) Very good.

3466
02:44:54.619 --> 02:44:55.452
Good.

3467
02:44:56.465 --> 02:44:58.703
ASHLEY: Dead people taste so good.
TALIESIN: I think so.

3468
02:44:58.703 --> 02:45:00.045
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, they do.

3469
02:45:01.194 --> 02:45:02.693
TALIESIN: Tea?

3470
02:45:02.693 --> 02:45:04.451
ASHLEY: No, I-- Yes, more, please.

3471
02:45:05.728 --> 02:45:07.163
MATT: Day three goes on

3472
02:45:07.163 --> 02:45:08.995
(laughter)

3473
02:45:08.995 --> 02:45:12.022
uneventful at sea comparatively,

3474
02:45:12.022 --> 02:45:16.012
though the gray skies are comforting as they remind you of

3475
02:45:16.012 --> 02:45:20.392
the better times growing up in the Empire.

3476
02:45:20.392 --> 02:45:23.358
Day four comes in, sky is still gray.

3477
02:45:24.453 --> 02:45:27.232
To the east, a cold wind begins to pick up

3478
02:45:27.232 --> 02:45:31.568
and it looks to be a storm coming; nothing too heavy,

3479
02:45:31.568 --> 02:45:34.443
but looks like rain is probably imminent.

3480
02:45:34.443 --> 02:45:35.968
MARISHA: Captain!

3481
02:45:35.968 --> 02:45:37.304
TRAVIS: Yes?

3482
02:45:37.304 --> 02:45:40.085
MARISHA: It appears a storm's a-coming.

3483
02:45:40.085 --> 02:45:41.768
TRAVIS: Why does your voice change

3484
02:45:41.768 --> 02:45:44.878
every time we're on this ship?
MARISHA: I'm assertive!

3485
02:45:44.878 --> 02:45:46.523
Veth is doing it, too!

3486
02:45:46.523 --> 02:45:47.689
TRAVIS: No.
MARISHA: She's talking weird.

3487
02:45:47.689 --> 02:45:48.539
TRAVIS: She's really not.

3488
02:45:48.539 --> 02:45:51.030
She's just very gung-ho about her job.

3489
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:52.722
It's-- she's very excited.

3490
02:45:52.722 --> 02:45:55.522
MARISHA: I'm gung-ho about my job as your first mate!

3491
02:45:55.522 --> 02:45:58.310
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I get it. What was your-- What were you--

3492
02:45:58.310 --> 02:46:02.233
MARISHA: Storms a-brewin', Captain!

3493
02:46:02.233 --> 02:46:04.316
LIAM: Off the coast of Maine!

3494
02:46:06.127 --> 02:46:08.519
TRAVIS: I can see that.

3495
02:46:08.519 --> 02:46:10.965
Any recommendations, First Mate?

3496
02:46:10.965 --> 02:46:13.106
MARISHA: Well, as they say

3497
02:46:14.333 --> 02:46:16.216
a red sky at night--

3498
02:46:16.216 --> 02:46:17.857
TRAVIS: It's not red.
MARISHA: -- is a sailor's delight.

3499
02:46:17.857 --> 02:46:19.615
TRAVIS: It's gray out.
MARISHA: And a red--

3500
02:46:19.615 --> 02:46:23.956
A gray sky in the morning is a sailor's warning.

3501
02:46:23.956 --> 02:46:26.131
That's what I read in a book.

3502
02:46:26.131 --> 02:46:28.198
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's true,
but it's pretty fucking good.

3503
02:46:28.198 --> 02:46:29.921
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: It sounds better.

3504
02:46:29.921 --> 02:46:31.497
(laughter)

3505
02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:34.367
TRAVIS: Yes.

3506
02:46:34.367 --> 02:46:36.995
MARISHA: That's it. That's all I have to report!

3507
02:46:36.995 --> 02:46:40.325
TRAVIS: Great. Make ready to ship for inclement weather.

3508
02:46:40.325 --> 02:46:41.898
MATT: Orly comes over.

3509
02:46:41.898 --> 02:46:42.815
MARISHA: Orly.

3510
02:46:44.205 --> 02:46:47.447
MATT: "(throat clearing) Captain."
TRAVIS: Yes, Orly? Ah!

3511
02:46:49.010 --> 02:46:51.885
MATT: "Looks like we're coming up

3512
02:46:53.025 --> 02:46:56.870
"on the Inkclaw Reef.

3513
02:46:56.870 --> 02:47:01.287
"Going to keep north of it so we don't

3514
02:47:01.287 --> 02:47:03.201
"get dragged under."

3515
02:47:03.201 --> 02:47:04.794
LAURA: Hey. What--

3516
02:47:04.794 --> 02:47:06.744
TRAVIS: Inkclaw Reef.

3517
02:47:06.744 --> 02:47:08.144
TALIESIN: Aye, Captain.

3518
02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:13.188
TRAVIS: Yes, no, yep. Continue your course. Yep.

3519
02:47:13.188 --> 02:47:16.062
Fucking-- oh, there it is.
TALIESIN: Steady as she goes.

3520
02:47:16.062 --> 02:47:17.280
MARISHA: Is it with an 'A'?

3521
02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:19.285
SAM: Do we know where we're going?
MARISHA: Inkclaw.

3522
02:47:19.285 --> 02:47:22.768
MATT: No, you're following the armada,
which you know is largely where it's going.

3523
02:47:22.768 --> 02:47:26.198
TALIESIN: I feel like we were supposed to
get off at the last overpass.

3524
02:47:26.198 --> 02:47:27.189
TRAVIS: We're heading south.

3525
02:47:27.189 --> 02:47:29.387
MATT: Yeah, you guys heading south-southeast.

3526
02:47:29.387 --> 02:47:32.887
Inkclaw Reef is actually around Urukayxl,

3527
02:47:32.887 --> 02:47:36.994
the island where the serpent folk were,

3528
02:47:36.994 --> 02:47:38.837
but you guys are skirting,

3529
02:47:38.837 --> 02:47:41.153
you're skirting north past the Reef,

3530
02:47:41.153 --> 02:47:44.060
and heading that direction. The armada itself is

3531
02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:45.892
arranging course appropriately.

3532
02:47:45.892 --> 02:47:48.832
You can all see the ships start
taking a little more of a separation

3533
02:47:48.832 --> 02:47:50.588
in preparation for the coming storm, in case the waves

3534
02:47:50.588 --> 02:47:53.626
get choppy, you don't want the ships too close together and

3535
02:47:53.626 --> 02:47:56.511
smashing into each other.

3536
02:47:56.511 --> 02:47:57.344
But yeah,

3537
02:47:57.344 --> 02:47:59.852
MARISHA: Orly, I have to--
MATT: "Mm-hmm?"

3538
02:47:59.852 --> 02:48:03.610
MARISHA: -- ready the ship for problematic weather.

3539
02:48:04.995 --> 02:48:07.403
What I do? Don't tell the captain.

3540
02:48:07.403 --> 02:48:09.947
MATT: "Ooh, well.

3541
02:48:09.947 --> 02:48:13.922
"M-M-Maybe it's best we

3542
02:48:13.922 --> 02:48:16.030
"get you together with

3543
02:48:16.030 --> 02:48:18.121
"M-M-Marius.

3544
02:48:19.794 --> 02:48:22.120
"He'll you show you around."

3545
02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:26.093
MARISHA: I have to work with Marius?
That guy sucks. All right.

3546
02:48:26.093 --> 02:48:27.692
TRAVIS: Beau!
MARISHA: What.

3547
02:48:27.692 --> 02:48:29.891
TRAVIS: Take Shelda with you.

3548
02:48:29.891 --> 02:48:31.849
MARISHA: (groans)

3549
02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:34.602
TALIESIN: I'm getting everything I paid for.

3550
02:48:34.602 --> 02:48:36.652
MARISHA: Yes, Captain.

3551
02:48:36.652 --> 02:48:37.852
TRAVIS: Where's that voice?

3552
02:48:37.852 --> 02:48:39.911
MARISHA: (exaggerated) Yes, Captain!

3553
02:48:41.274 --> 02:48:42.107
MATT: All right.

3554
02:48:42.107 --> 02:48:47.107
Preparing the ship for the storm, getting the sails ready,

3555
02:48:47.707 --> 02:48:50.476
battening down the hatches.

3556
02:48:50.476 --> 02:48:51.375
TALIESIN: Hatches battened.

3557
02:48:51.375 --> 02:48:52.699
TRAVIS: I just wanted somebody to say it.

3558
02:48:52.699 --> 02:48:54.276
MATT: Yeah.

3559
02:48:54.276 --> 02:48:58.023
But the evening comes. The rain does begin

3560
02:48:58.023 --> 02:49:01.273
to kick in a little ways into sunset.

3561
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:04.607
It is a strong rain.

3562
02:49:04.607 --> 02:49:05.440
TRAVIS: Ooh.

3563
02:49:06.618 --> 02:49:07.451
MATT: So,

3564
02:49:08.318 --> 02:49:09.151
the evening

3565
02:49:10.367 --> 02:49:12.617
comes toward to all of you.

3566
02:49:14.570 --> 02:49:16.570
Mostly uneventful night.

3567
02:49:18.788 --> 02:49:20.354
I will say here.

3568
02:49:22.882 --> 02:49:24.232
There you go.

3569
02:49:25.402 --> 02:49:26.235
LAURA: Oh no.

3570
02:49:27.815 --> 02:49:31.682
MATT: Give me just second. I need to get all my
audio ducks in a row here.

3571
02:49:31.682 --> 02:49:34.695
LIAM: Way to date this episode.

3572
02:49:34.695 --> 02:49:35.528
MATT: Yeah.

3573
02:49:36.511 --> 02:49:39.428
TRAVIS: "Way to date this episode"?

3574
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:51.830
MATT: You hear it first.

3575
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:52.842
SAM: Shit.

3576
02:49:52.842 --> 02:49:54.578
MATT: Catching your attention, Yasha.
LAURA: Oh no.

3577
02:49:54.578 --> 02:49:55.411
LIAM: Yaas!

3578
02:49:56.923 --> 02:49:58.456
LAURA: Oh no.

3579
02:49:58.456 --> 02:49:59.997
MATT: A familiar

3580
02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:04.002
welcoming delight.

3581
02:50:04.002 --> 02:50:05.260
[thunder rumbling]

3582
02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:07.629
ALL: Ooh!

3583
02:50:07.629 --> 02:50:11.147
TRAVIS: What the fuck?!
SAM: There's lights and shit!

3584
02:50:11.147 --> 02:50:12.563
LIAM: (laughs)

3585
02:50:13.708 --> 02:50:17.585
MATT: As you hear it from through the wood,

3586
02:50:17.585 --> 02:50:21.418
laying in your bunk, and keep your eyes closed.

3587
02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:28.340
Eventually, the early, early morning hours

3588
02:50:28.668 --> 02:50:30.775
push you to rest,

3589
02:50:30.775 --> 02:50:33.837
the thunder lulling you to sleep.

3590
02:50:33.837 --> 02:50:37.235
Each of you find your way to your bunks as well, as

3591
02:50:37.235 --> 02:50:39.468
Orly takes over the ship

3592
02:50:39.468 --> 02:50:40.545
and the rest of the crew.

3593
02:50:40.545 --> 02:50:42.027
LAURA: Is it really rocky at this point?

3594
02:50:42.027 --> 02:50:45.279
MATT: It's pretty rocky back and forth.

3595
02:50:45.279 --> 02:50:48.978
For some, it's uncomfortable, for some it's almost

3596
02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:52.737
like being rocked as a baby.

3597
02:50:57.485 --> 02:51:00.926
In your early storm-based dreams,

3598
02:51:00.926 --> 02:51:04.092
the rumble brings with it

3599
02:51:04.092 --> 02:51:08.328
imagery of you once again lost

3600
02:51:08.328 --> 02:51:10.753
in the barren plains of Xhorhas.

3601
02:51:12.675 --> 02:51:16.755
All darkness but for the distant red horizon.

3602
02:51:16.755 --> 02:51:19.773
Your whole body is sore as you trudge through

3603
02:51:19.773 --> 02:51:24.523
the mud and muck. You can see the storm brewing ahead

3604
02:51:24.523 --> 02:51:27.277
and as you look down at your hands, you can see the shackles

3605
02:51:27.277 --> 02:51:29.803
that once bound your wrists,

3606
02:51:29.803 --> 02:51:33.137
chains dangling from them, now broken.

3607
02:51:35.407 --> 02:51:37.397
As you look up once, more you can see

3608
02:51:37.397 --> 02:51:40.830
the flash of light from the clouds above.

3609
02:51:46.465 --> 02:51:48.465
And there's expectation.

3610
02:51:51.633 --> 02:51:56.625
You look down ahead and warmly alit before you is a path,

3611
02:51:57.607 --> 02:51:59.940
red like the horizon itself.

3612
02:52:03.858 --> 02:52:05.200
Do you walk it?

3613
02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:06.525
TRAVIS: Ooh.

3614
02:52:06.525 --> 02:52:08.100
ASHLEY: Absolutely.

3615
02:52:10.692 --> 02:52:14.008
MATT: As you walk the path onward,

3616
02:52:14.008 --> 02:52:15.706
onward,

3617
02:52:15.706 --> 02:52:18.606
(crackling) a bolt of lightning hits the ground,

3618
02:52:18.606 --> 02:52:20.888
but 100 feet from you.

3619
02:52:20.888 --> 02:52:24.425
The sound deafens your ears as the blast echoes.

3620
02:52:24.425 --> 02:52:27.950
Your vision goes white for a moment,

3621
02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:30.555
but you keep pushing forward.

3622
02:52:30.555 --> 02:52:34.038
Another flash 40 feet from you,

3623
02:52:34.038 --> 02:52:37.077
sending shards of rock and glass showering

3624
02:52:37.077 --> 02:52:39.160
down from your left side.

3625
02:52:40.185 --> 02:52:41.646
Do you continue on the path?

3626
02:52:41.646 --> 02:52:42.604
ASHLEY: Yes.

3627
02:52:46.050 --> 02:52:48.958
MATT: Pushing forward, the rain begins to fall,

3628
02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:51.792
and pummeling you, turning to hail.

3629
02:52:51.792 --> 02:52:56.323
Your skin numb with the hundreds and hundreds of vast

3630
02:52:56.323 --> 02:52:58.390
and quick impacts.

3631
02:52:58.390 --> 02:53:03.310
(crackling) Another flash hits
the path directly in front of you

3632
02:53:03.310 --> 02:53:08.100
scattering it into a small chasm before you.

3633
02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:11.457
As you come close it seems to widen with each step.

3634
02:53:11.457 --> 02:53:13.892
The ground pulling further and further away until you come

3635
02:53:13.892 --> 02:53:15.292
to the very edge.

3636
02:53:16.608 --> 02:53:17.941
What do you do?

3637
02:53:19.432 --> 02:53:20.532
ASHLEY: I jump.

3638
02:53:23.028 --> 02:53:24.963
[thunder rolling]

3639
02:53:24.963 --> 02:53:28.198
MATT: You run and you leap.

3640
02:53:28.198 --> 02:53:32.435
As you leap, the other side continues to stretch away.

3641
02:53:32.435 --> 02:53:34.010
You fall,

3642
02:53:34.010 --> 02:53:36.210
and you fall,

3643
02:53:36.210 --> 02:53:37.435
and you fall.

3644
02:53:37.435 --> 02:53:41.970
And you look up as the wide mouth of this chasm

3645
02:53:41.970 --> 02:53:45.814
goes further and further away and looking up into the sky,

3646
02:53:45.814 --> 02:53:50.814
all you see are the electric eyes in the clouds.

3647
02:53:51.012 --> 02:53:52.429
What do you do?

3648
02:54:04.390 --> 02:54:06.590
ASHLEY: I

3649
02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:09.250
cry out to the Storm Lord.

3650
02:54:09.250 --> 02:54:11.020
And I reach out a hand.

3651
02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:12.520
MATT: What do you say?

3652
02:54:19.408 --> 02:54:20.241
ASHLEY: Please,

3653
02:54:24.877 --> 02:54:26.127
please help me.

3654
02:54:39.337 --> 02:54:43.745
MATT: (crackling) A bolt of lightning
strikes from the sky and hits you.

3655
02:54:43.745 --> 02:54:45.161
TRAVIS and SAM: Ooh.

3656
02:54:45.161 --> 02:54:49.225
MATT: Your entire body is rocked with pain.

3657
02:54:49.225 --> 02:54:53.449
This vibration of strength as to cause

3658
02:54:53.449 --> 02:54:57.445
every element of your senses to be rocked.

3659
02:55:00.580 --> 02:55:04.096
And you push through the pain as hard as you can

3660
02:55:04.096 --> 02:55:08.804
to continue to keep your contact with this cloud.

3661
02:55:10.198 --> 02:55:14.115
Go ahead and roll a wisdom saving throw for me.

3662
02:55:19.090 --> 02:55:20.423
ASHLEY: That's cocked.

3663
02:55:22.890 --> 02:55:24.032
Nine.

3664
02:55:24.032 --> 02:55:25.453
MATT: A nine.

3665
02:55:25.453 --> 02:55:27.394
TRAVIS and LAURA: (whispering) Nein!

3666
02:55:27.394 --> 02:55:28.763
ASHLEY: Sorry, a ten.

3667
02:55:28.763 --> 02:55:29.790
MATT: A ten.

3668
02:55:29.790 --> 02:55:31.865
Your muscles tense--

3669
02:55:31.865 --> 02:55:32.698
SAM: Nine plus one.

3670
02:55:32.698 --> 02:55:34.799
MATT: -- and you continue to plummet.

3671
02:55:37.716 --> 02:55:39.357
"Prove."

3672
02:55:50.206 --> 02:55:51.847
ASHLEY: I'm going to bamf out my wings.

3673
02:55:51.847 --> 02:55:53.397
LAURA: Yeah!

3674
02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:56.388
ASHLEY: Necrotic Shroud.

3675
02:55:57.983 --> 02:55:59.933
MATT: The pain through your body--

3676
02:55:59.933 --> 02:56:01.908
you can see the skin itself

3677
02:56:01.908 --> 02:56:06.908
splitting from where the energy required a place to escape.

3678
02:56:07.348 --> 02:56:09.969
As you close your eyes and scream

3679
02:56:09.969 --> 02:56:12.394
out loud into the darkness,

3680
02:56:12.394 --> 02:56:15.696
this chasm now a razor-thin mark

3681
02:56:15.696 --> 02:56:18.330
of red, clouded sky above.

3682
02:56:19.443 --> 02:56:22.775
Before the abyss takes you, you scream

3683
02:56:22.775 --> 02:56:26.267
and release the essence of the celestial blood

3684
02:56:26.267 --> 02:56:28.258
that sits in your veins.

3685
02:56:30.117 --> 02:56:34.220
And with that, the chasm grows closer,

3686
02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:36.055
and closer,

3687
02:56:36.055 --> 02:56:37.163
and closer,

3688
02:56:38.380 --> 02:56:41.412
until you find yourself pushing out

3689
02:56:41.412 --> 02:56:43.134
from the opening in the ground,

3690
02:56:43.134 --> 02:56:47.160
where once you fell. Your feet resting once more on the path

3691
02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:49.352
on the other side.

3692
02:56:49.352 --> 02:56:53.757
As you stop and your wings gather around you,

3693
02:56:53.757 --> 02:56:55.174
they are not black,

3694
02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:57.151
but feathered.

3695
02:56:57.151 --> 02:56:58.409
TRAVIS: Ooh!

3696
02:56:58.409 --> 02:56:59.759
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3697
02:57:02.632 --> 02:57:04.773
MATT: The voice once more says,

3698
02:57:08.242 --> 02:57:09.667
"You are worthy

3699
02:57:11.593 --> 02:57:13.684
"both of my guidance

3700
02:57:14.810 --> 02:57:17.277
"and of your own acceptance.

3701
02:57:19.283 --> 02:57:21.700
"This path before you is long,

3702
02:57:23.122 --> 02:57:25.205
"and I won't let you stray."

3703
02:57:30.573 --> 02:57:31.413
Fjord.

3704
02:57:31.413 --> 02:57:33.004
SAM: Ooh!
LAURA: (fake sobbing)

3705
02:57:33.004 --> 02:57:34.690
TRAVIS: What? What?

3706
02:57:34.690 --> 02:57:36.773
SAM: You also have wings.
MARISHA: The eye.

3707
02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:43.193
MATT: A night of restless sleep comes to you.

3708
02:57:43.193 --> 02:57:45.488
TRAVIS: (quietly) Fuck. Jesus fuck.

3709
02:57:45.488 --> 02:57:48.750
MATT: Whether it be the sound of the heavy rain hitting

3710
02:57:48.750 --> 02:57:53.450
the glass doors on the outside of your captain's quarters,

3711
02:57:53.450 --> 02:57:57.266
just the anxiety of the coming interaction,

3712
02:57:58.477 --> 02:58:00.918
but you toss and turn quite a bit.

3713
02:58:02.930 --> 02:58:06.738
But once sleep does take you, you have

3714
02:58:06.738 --> 02:58:08.438
visions of being

3715
02:58:10.323 --> 02:58:14.443
in a forest once more, not unlike the one

3716
02:58:14.443 --> 02:58:18.843
that you had traversed to help Caduceus find his family.

3717
02:58:21.262 --> 02:58:22.262
You're alone,

3718
02:58:24.100 --> 02:58:27.066
and you don't know where to go.

3719
02:58:28.087 --> 02:58:29.420
You travel a bit,

3720
02:58:31.355 --> 02:58:33.763
and it just continues

3721
02:58:35.093 --> 02:58:38.760
almost the same, like it's a repeating glade.

3722
02:58:40.629 --> 02:58:42.296
You push past trees.

3723
02:58:43.621 --> 02:58:46.558
The rain now falls through the top of the forest

3724
02:58:46.558 --> 02:58:48.150
and you hear the distant rumbles of thunder

3725
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:49.942
carrying into the space.

3726
02:58:49.942 --> 02:58:53.375
[thunder rolling]

3727
02:58:53.375 --> 02:58:54.792
What do you do?

3728
02:59:02.780 --> 02:59:05.890
TRAVIS: Repeating forest. Thunder.

3729
02:59:05.890 --> 02:59:08.629
(loud knuckle cracking)

3730
02:59:08.629 --> 02:59:10.112
God, these are hard.

3731
02:59:13.687 --> 02:59:16.020
Ah...

3732
02:59:21.456 --> 02:59:24.089
I will summon the sword.

3733
02:59:25.870 --> 02:59:28.630
Can I sink it into the earth

3734
02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:35.000
and try and listen for the voice of the Wild Mother?

3735
02:59:35.242 --> 02:59:37.925
MATT: You summon the sword to your hand

3736
02:59:38.903 --> 02:59:41.153
and what stares back at you

3737
02:59:42.090 --> 02:59:43.923
is not the runed blade

3738
02:59:45.508 --> 02:59:46.974
that you found on this journey,

3739
02:59:46.974 --> 02:59:49.298
but the familiar,

3740
02:59:49.298 --> 02:59:51.827
curved falchion,

3741
02:59:51.827 --> 02:59:54.209
with a singular yellow eye looking back.

3742
02:59:54.209 --> 02:59:57.208
And you feel (pulsing)

3743
02:59:57.208 --> 02:59:59.625
a burning pain in your chest.

3744
03:00:01.127 --> 03:00:05.427
(pulsing) It burns even brighter and hotter

3745
03:00:07.073 --> 03:00:11.765
and suddenly it's a pain that is unbearable.

3746
03:00:12.853 --> 03:00:17.002
As you come to consciousness trying to scream,

3747
03:00:17.002 --> 03:00:19.477
but you're winded

3748
03:00:19.477 --> 03:00:22.973
as a dark figure stands over your bed

3749
03:00:22.973 --> 03:00:24.740
a blade plunged in your chest.

3750
03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:26.600
MARISHA and LAURA: (gasping)

3751
03:00:26.600 --> 03:00:27.433
SAM: Ooh?

3752
03:00:28.973 --> 03:00:30.031
<i>Nani</i>?

3753
03:00:31.078 --> 03:00:32.932
TRAVIS: The fucking girl!

3754
03:00:32.932 --> 03:00:35.515
MARISHA: Ooh, no!

3755
03:00:36.583 --> 03:00:37.716
MATT: You suffer

3756
03:00:39.463 --> 03:00:44.463
12 points of slashing damage, as well as

3757
03:00:44.485 --> 03:00:46.630
four points of psychic damage.

3758
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:47.996
SAM: Not too terrible.

3759
03:00:47.996 --> 03:00:48.829
TRAVIS: Okay.

3760
03:00:48.829 --> 03:00:51.047
LAURA: It's a priest of Uk'otoa or something.

3761
03:00:51.047 --> 03:00:52.255
SAM and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

3762
03:00:52.255 --> 03:00:55.014
MATT: As you lie there, the blade--

3763
03:00:56.158 --> 03:01:00.625
a familiar-looking, barnacle-encrusted falchion--

3764
03:01:00.625 --> 03:01:04.525
partially thrust into your abdomen.

3765
03:01:05.705 --> 03:01:08.671
The creature holding it appears humanoid before you--

3766
03:01:08.671 --> 03:01:09.504
TRAVIS: No.

3767
03:01:09.504 --> 03:01:12.601
MATT: -- but you see heavy, tattered robes,

3768
03:01:12.601 --> 03:01:17.601
and slivers of cloth. You see grayish-blue skin.

3769
03:01:17.838 --> 03:01:22.613
You see a humanoid face with long, thick tendrils of hair,

3770
03:01:22.613 --> 03:01:27.259
yellow eyes, and the jaw itself seemingly split partially

3771
03:01:27.259 --> 03:01:29.784
open and just breathing

3772
03:01:30.642 --> 03:01:33.881
like an exaggerated Predator.

3773
03:01:35.361 --> 03:01:36.200
[thunder rumbling]

3774
03:01:36.200 --> 03:01:37.391
Let's go ahead and roll initiative.

3775
03:01:37.391 --> 03:01:40.463
ALL: What?!

3776
03:01:40.463 --> 03:01:42.584
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

3777
03:01:42.584 --> 03:01:44.480
(yelling)

3778
03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:47.275
SAM: This unexpected combat is
brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

3779
03:01:47.275 --> 03:01:51.163
They'll be at AdeptiCon this year, Booth 801.

3780
03:01:51.163 --> 03:01:54.690
Bring your armies and wage war
on the ultimate battlefield terrain.

3781
03:01:54.690 --> 03:01:57.168
Find more at DwarvenForge.com.

3782
03:01:57.168 --> 03:01:59.989
What is happening?!
LIAM: This is exciting!

3783
03:01:59.989 --> 03:02:02.889
(cheering)

3784
03:02:02.889 --> 03:02:05.597
LAURA: Where his cabin? Where's Fjord?

3785
03:02:05.597 --> 03:02:06.863
Where are the rest of us?

3786
03:02:06.863 --> 03:02:09.173
Is he in captain's quarters and the rest of us--?

3787
03:02:09.173 --> 03:02:12.907
SAM: Where's Yasha? Is Yasha flying out over the ocean?

3788
03:02:12.907 --> 03:02:14.607
LIAM: That was in her dreams.

3789
03:02:14.607 --> 03:02:15.588
LAURA: Yasha was having a--

3790
03:02:15.588 --> 03:02:17.788
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was just a dream.

3791
03:02:17.788 --> 03:02:21.255
SAM: I mean, those don't even look like boats, Matt.

3792
03:02:21.255 --> 03:02:22.847
MATT: So this is the gun deck.

3793
03:02:22.847 --> 03:02:24.379
MARISHA: Yeah, what is it? What is it?

3794
03:02:24.379 --> 03:02:26.388
MATT: This is the cargo hold beneath.

3795
03:02:26.388 --> 03:02:29.602
So top level, mid level, bottom level.

3796
03:02:29.602 --> 03:02:30.926
TRAVIS: Fjord is right here, right?

3797
03:02:30.926 --> 03:02:32.784
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Mid level, bottom level, okay.

3798
03:02:32.784 --> 03:02:34.592
MARISHA: He said blue skin?

3799
03:02:34.592 --> 03:02:36.003
SAM: What is happening?
MARISHA: What the fuck is happening?

3800
03:02:36.003 --> 03:02:37.235
MATT: Fjord.

3801
03:02:37.235 --> 03:02:39.976
You are in bed.

3802
03:02:44.899 --> 03:02:46.911
While this creature here--

3803
03:02:46.911 --> 03:02:47.744
SAM: What does it look like?

3804
03:02:47.744 --> 03:02:49.752
LAURA: What is it? Does it look like Avantika?

3805
03:02:49.752 --> 03:02:53.383
MATT: I mean, it's what I am using for the creature.
LAURA: Does it look like dead Avantika?

3806
03:02:54.450 --> 03:02:55.541
MATT: No.

3807
03:02:57.299 --> 03:02:59.040
TRAVIS: That's not Avantika.

3808
03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:00.641
MATT: Where are you guys sleeping in the ship?

3809
03:03:00.641 --> 03:03:02.007
LAURA: I don't know!

3810
03:03:02.007 --> 03:03:04.096
Are these the only places to sleep?
TRAVIS: It has the sword.

3811
03:03:04.096 --> 03:03:07.194
SAM: I would be in a hammock between two cannons.

3812
03:03:07.194 --> 03:03:08.190
TRAVIS: I don't know.

3813
03:03:08.190 --> 03:03:12.259
MATT: Okay, so we'll put you over here.

3814
03:03:12.259 --> 03:03:16.201
TRAVIS: What the fucking horse nipples is happening?!

3815
03:03:16.201 --> 03:03:17.250
MATT: Out on the floor here?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3816
03:03:17.250 --> 03:03:20.322
MARISHA: Is this the same morning
that I was prepping the boat?

3817
03:03:20.322 --> 03:03:22.187
Or is this the next day?

3818
03:03:22.187 --> 03:03:24.827
MATT: This is, like, 2:30 in the morning.

3819
03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:28.328
After everyone's gone to sleep.

3820
03:03:28.328 --> 03:03:30.058
LAURA: I guess--
MATT: Jester?

3821
03:03:30.058 --> 03:03:31.758
TRAVIS: You just gave me full body pimples. Seriously.

3822
03:03:31.758 --> 03:03:34.015
LAURA: I'm going to be on the bottom-bottom.

3823
03:03:34.015 --> 03:03:34.848
MATT: The bottom-bottom?

3824
03:03:34.848 --> 03:03:37.247
LAURA: Yeah, in the green fancy bed.

3825
03:03:37.247 --> 03:03:38.096
MATT: There you go.

3826
03:03:38.096 --> 03:03:39.604
TRAVIS: I was enjoying your shit, then I was like,

3827
03:03:39.604 --> 03:03:41.012
nope. No.
MATT: Caduceus?

3828
03:03:41.012 --> 03:03:44.382
TALIESIN: Cot on the gun deck,

3829
03:03:44.382 --> 03:03:45.506
MATT: Right here?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3830
03:03:45.506 --> 03:03:46.339
MATT: All right.

3831
03:03:46.339 --> 03:03:48.842
LAURA: There's a big double wide, actually.

3832
03:03:48.842 --> 03:03:51.365
Maybe I would take that big one.

3833
03:03:51.365 --> 03:03:53.055
MATT: Switch to the big one?
LAURA: Yeah.

3834
03:03:53.055 --> 03:03:54.775
TALIESIN: That's definitely the bed
that says "hope springs eternal."

3835
03:03:54.775 --> 03:03:57.082
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, let's pick out our beds right now.

3836
03:03:57.082 --> 03:03:57.915
MATT: Beauregard.

3837
03:03:57.915 --> 03:04:00.224
TRAVIS: Got a fucking sword in my chest.
MARISHA: Beau would also sleep on the floor.

3838
03:04:00.224 --> 03:04:02.143
Beau is very comfortable sleeping on the floor.
MATT: Across from Caduceus?

3839
03:04:02.143 --> 03:04:03.607
MARISHA: Across from Caduceus.

3840
03:04:03.607 --> 03:04:04.440
MATT: All righty.

3841
03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:05.273
TRAVIS: Picking beds.
MATT: Caleb.

3842
03:04:05.273 --> 03:04:08.507
LIAM: Red bed.
SAM: Red bed redemption?

3843
03:04:08.507 --> 03:04:09.650
LIAM: Red bed.

3844
03:04:09.650 --> 03:04:11.448
Red bed!

3845
03:04:11.448 --> 03:04:12.448
MATT: All righty.

3846
03:04:14.532 --> 03:04:15.929
MARISHA: What is it?

3847
03:04:15.929 --> 03:04:17.142
MATT: So.

3848
03:04:17.142 --> 03:04:19.400
TRAVIS: (laughs) You--!

3849
03:04:23.909 --> 03:04:25.634
MATT: Ah, okay.

3850
03:04:31.911 --> 03:04:33.336
LIAM: The fuck do we do?

3851
03:04:36.524 --> 03:04:39.357
MATT: Just a minute here as I situate this.

3852
03:04:45.926 --> 03:04:47.092
All right.

3853
03:04:51.274 --> 03:04:52.107
Hmm!

3854
03:04:54.854 --> 03:04:56.212
LAURA: We wouldn't even know, though.

3855
03:04:56.212 --> 03:04:57.615
MATT: Nope!
TALIESIN: No.

3856
03:04:57.615 --> 03:05:00.213
MATT: So, Fjord, what'd you get?

3857
03:05:00.213 --> 03:05:01.483
TRAVIS: 15.

3858
03:05:01.483 --> 03:05:02.946
MATT: 15, okay.

3859
03:05:02.946 --> 03:05:04.701
MARISHA: Oh, we didn't roll initiative.

3860
03:05:04.701 --> 03:05:06.659
LAURA: We're not rolling yet.
MARISHA: We're not rolling.

3861
03:05:07.572 --> 03:05:08.413
MATT: All righty.

3862
03:05:08.413 --> 03:05:12.879
Getting this all situated and ready here for me to look at.

3863
03:05:12.879 --> 03:05:13.713
That puts Fjord--

3864
03:05:13.713 --> 03:05:15.597
LIAM: Travis in the hot seat.

3865
03:05:15.597 --> 03:05:18.805
TRAVIS: I was just enjoying Ashley's ride,
and then I got caught looking.

3866
03:05:20.418 --> 03:05:21.726
MATT: It happens, man.

3867
03:05:21.726 --> 03:05:23.288
ASHLEY: [inaudible]

3868
03:05:24.386 --> 03:05:25.751
When he looks over at you and you're like,

3869
03:05:25.751 --> 03:05:27.476
"No, no, no, no, no, no."

3870
03:05:27.476 --> 03:05:28.638
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

3871
03:05:30.513 --> 03:05:34.863
TALIESIN: Please, spare me another day. Today's not my day.

3872
03:05:36.948 --> 03:05:38.722
ASHLEY: Oh my god, look at the shark.

3873
03:05:38.722 --> 03:05:41.629
TALIESIN: I know, I was really enjoying the shark.

3874
03:05:41.629 --> 03:05:46.387
MATT: Okay, thank you for getting this situated here.

3875
03:05:46.387 --> 03:05:48.557
So, Fjord, you are prone on the bed.

3876
03:05:48.557 --> 03:05:51.167
You're not wearing armor because you were sleeping.

3877
03:05:51.167 --> 03:05:52.740
TRAVIS: Oh, should my AC be lower?

3878
03:05:52.740 --> 03:05:56.613
MATT: Your AC is 10 plus your dexterity modifier right now.

3879
03:05:56.613 --> 03:06:00.105
TRAVIS: Oh, that's 10 plus my dex mod.

3880
03:06:00.105 --> 03:06:01.495
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Cool, it's 10.

3881
03:06:01.495 --> 03:06:03.246
MATT: All right, cool.

3882
03:06:03.246 --> 03:06:05.885
So it's their turn first.
LAURA: You have low fucking dex!

3883
03:06:05.885 --> 03:06:07.610
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's why I might be dead right now.

3884
03:06:08.907 --> 03:06:12.550
MATT: So this entity pulls the blade from your chest,

3885
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:16.437
an arc of blood across the outer wall and the window

3886
03:06:16.437 --> 03:06:19.395
on the side just across the edge.

3887
03:06:20.932 --> 03:06:22.515
It's going to go ahead

3888
03:06:23.553 --> 03:06:24.386
and

3889
03:06:25.292 --> 03:06:27.263
attempt to bite you.

3890
03:06:27.263 --> 03:06:28.665
You watch its jaws partially open,

3891
03:06:28.665 --> 03:06:31.092
it goes (snarling) and then goes towards you

3892
03:06:31.092 --> 03:06:32.698
and attempts to clamp down on your body.

3893
03:06:32.698 --> 03:06:34.087
TRAVIS: What?!

3894
03:06:34.087 --> 03:06:35.182
MATT: It's a natural 20.

3895
03:06:35.182 --> 03:06:37.177
LAURA: Oh no!

3896
03:06:37.177 --> 03:06:39.375
No!
TRAVIS: I believe you.

3897
03:06:39.375 --> 03:06:41.538
MATT: I'm rolling that sapphire dice.
It came up on a sapphire.

3898
03:06:41.538 --> 03:06:42.849
TRAVIS: Get rid of that thing.

3899
03:06:42.849 --> 03:06:44.525
MATT: Good news is,

3900
03:06:44.525 --> 03:06:47.443
it's not the other attack.

3901
03:06:47.443 --> 03:06:49.993
And I roll a six. That's twelve plus five.

3902
03:06:49.993 --> 03:06:53.400
17 points of piercing damage as it sinks into your body.

3903
03:06:53.400 --> 03:06:54.708
You feel the pain

3904
03:06:54.708 --> 03:06:59.122
as it tears upward and you see, there are bite marks

3905
03:06:59.122 --> 03:07:00.912
scraped into your abdomen

3906
03:07:00.912 --> 03:07:03.877
as it pulls up and (snarls) sucks in

3907
03:07:03.877 --> 03:07:05.613
some of the blood that it's taken from the wound.

3908
03:07:05.613 --> 03:07:07.990
It's going to strike you twice with its sword.

3909
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.823
TRAVIS: Okay.

3910
03:07:10.543 --> 03:07:12.126
MATT: It's a natural one.

3911
03:07:13.690 --> 03:07:15.575
Fucking lucky.

3912
03:07:15.575 --> 03:07:16.990
That's cocked.

3913
03:07:16.990 --> 03:07:21.255
And it's a 24 to hit.

3914
03:07:21.255 --> 03:07:24.045
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.
MATT: So this blade strikes once towards you.

3915
03:07:24.045 --> 03:07:26.042
You roll out of the way it slams into the bed.

3916
03:07:26.042 --> 03:07:29.852
As you pull back, it arcs upward
and cuts you across the side.

3917
03:07:29.852 --> 03:07:31.352
You take--

3918
03:07:36.312 --> 03:07:38.787
(thunder rumbling)

3919
03:07:41.245 --> 03:07:43.280
13 points of slashing damage

3920
03:07:43.280 --> 03:07:44.876
and two points of psychic damage.

3921
03:07:44.876 --> 03:07:46.332
TRAVIS: All right.

3922
03:07:47.290 --> 03:07:50.253
Shit. And that was in addition to the bite damage as well?

3923
03:07:50.253 --> 03:07:51.865
MATT: Correct.

3924
03:07:51.865 --> 03:07:53.642
TRAVIS: Did you give me bite damage?

3925
03:07:53.642 --> 03:07:54.950
MATT: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: You did?

3926
03:07:54.950 --> 03:07:56.892
TALIESIN: It wasn't terrible.

3927
03:07:56.892 --> 03:07:59.399
TRAVIS: I don't think I put it down. Do you remember?
MATT: It was 17 points.

3928
03:07:59.399 --> 03:08:02.768
TRAVIS: Oh, that's different.

3929
03:08:02.768 --> 03:08:04.601
TALIESIN: Twelve plus five.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3930
03:08:05.471 --> 03:08:06.996
Woof. Woof.

3931
03:08:06.996 --> 03:08:08.029
MATT: It's your turn, Fjord.

3932
03:08:08.029 --> 03:08:11.224
TRAVIS: That dude dropped me in half, or thing.

3933
03:08:12.242 --> 03:08:13.742
That changes a lot. Okay.

3934
03:08:15.508 --> 03:08:17.447
Can I summon the s--

3935
03:08:17.447 --> 03:08:19.685
MATT: You summon your blade?
TRAVIS: Yep.

3936
03:08:19.685 --> 03:08:21.127
MATT: Your sword summons to your side.

3937
03:08:21.127 --> 03:08:22.997
LAURA: Is it the real one?
MARISHA: I know, which one is it?

3938
03:08:22.997 --> 03:08:25.550
MATT: It's your rune blade.

3939
03:08:25.550 --> 03:08:30.010
And looking around, you can see
the blade in this creature's hand

3940
03:08:30.010 --> 03:08:35.010
is the Sword of Fathoms,
or at least looks very much like it.

3941
03:08:35.407 --> 03:08:36.240
TRAVIS: Okay.

3942
03:08:39.532 --> 03:08:41.115
Can I cast--

3943
03:08:42.827 --> 03:08:46.578
I got to get the fuck out of here.

3944
03:08:46.578 --> 03:08:47.411
Can I--

3945
03:08:49.100 --> 03:08:52.528
I can't let him hit me again. I'm fucking smoked.

3946
03:08:52.528 --> 03:08:56.880
I'm going to cast Far Step at 5th-level.

3947
03:08:56.880 --> 03:08:58.170
MATT: Okay.

3948
03:08:58.170 --> 03:09:01.637
TRAVIS: Which lets me "teleport 60 feet
to an unoccupied space

3949
03:09:01.637 --> 03:09:03.660
"you can see. Each one of your turns before the spell ends,

3950
03:09:03.660 --> 03:09:06.777
"you can use a bonus action to teleport in this way again."

3951
03:09:06.777 --> 03:09:11.247
And I will (bamfing) out of the
captain's quarters onto the main deck.

3952
03:09:11.247 --> 03:09:12.547
MATT: To where you can see.

3953
03:09:12.547 --> 03:09:13.743
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3954
03:09:13.743 --> 03:09:16.047
MATT: Right now, you only have a visual outside this window

3955
03:09:16.047 --> 03:09:18.830
and outside onto the deck out there.

3956
03:09:22.450 --> 03:09:25.400
TRAVIS: Is this a doorway? Is there a door, or just--

3957
03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:27.658
MATT: This is a door that goes between, technically,

3958
03:09:27.658 --> 03:09:29.300
but it's not on the ship.

3959
03:09:31.638 --> 03:09:34.125
LAURA: But as a bonus action, you can then use it.

3960
03:09:34.125 --> 03:09:35.923
MATT: On subsequent turns, yes.
LAURA: Oh, on subsequent turns.

3961
03:09:35.923 --> 03:09:39.118
TRAVIS: Let's roll with the Wild Mother.
I bamf out of the ship.

3962
03:09:39.118 --> 03:09:40.143
MATT: Just out this way?
TRAVIS: Outside.

3963
03:09:40.143 --> 03:09:41.376
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3964
03:09:42.693 --> 03:09:43.693
MATT: How far do you go?

3965
03:09:43.693 --> 03:09:46.826
TRAVIS: (splashing) Into the water 60 feet.

3966
03:09:46.826 --> 03:09:47.659
Let's make it 40.

3967
03:09:47.659 --> 03:09:49.433
I'll just make it 40 so I can stay within range.

3968
03:09:49.433 --> 03:09:52.426
MATT: (splashing) You're in the ocean as you appear

3969
03:09:52.426 --> 03:09:56.020
and just go into a full dive into the ocean,

3970
03:09:56.020 --> 03:09:57.720
come up, breaking the surface.

3971
03:09:57.720 --> 03:09:59.011
All right, you can move, if want to.
MARISHA: There's blood.

3972
03:09:59.011 --> 03:10:00.276
Swimming in blood. Yeah.

3973
03:10:00.276 --> 03:10:05.080
MATT: Yeah, you have very heavy, open wound
now filled with seawater.

3974
03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:07.370
It stings a lot.

3975
03:10:07.370 --> 03:10:09.302
TRAVIS: And I'll just--
LAURA: Salt is good for it.

3976
03:10:09.302 --> 03:10:10.380
TRAVIS: -- weakly shout out:

3977
03:10:10.380 --> 03:10:12.937
Man overboard! But it's fucking thundering

3978
03:10:12.937 --> 03:10:14.303
and lightning outside.

3979
03:10:14.303 --> 03:10:15.494
MATT: It is.

3980
03:10:16.965 --> 03:10:17.798
Huh!

3981
03:10:18.993 --> 03:10:21.182
Rushing up to the side,

3982
03:10:21.182 --> 03:10:23.640
you see Orly glance over and go,

3983
03:10:25.558 --> 03:10:26.910
"Captain!"

3984
03:10:26.910 --> 03:10:29.625
And he starts looking for a rope and getting ready

3985
03:10:29.625 --> 03:10:32.730
and starts shouting orders as other individuals

3986
03:10:32.730 --> 03:10:36.252
start rushing up. Marius goes over and starts helping

3987
03:10:36.252 --> 03:10:37.881
to get the rope up there.

3988
03:10:37.881 --> 03:10:40.340
LAURA: (laughs) Look at his little figure!

3989
03:10:40.340 --> 03:10:43.839
SAM: (nasally) Hello! I am Marius!

3990
03:10:43.839 --> 03:10:45.710
MATT: Passive perception,

3991
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:49.027
you do see on the outside of the boat, climbing up beyond

3992
03:10:49.027 --> 03:10:52.823
the view of them, a handful of other creatures

3993
03:10:52.823 --> 03:10:54.823
that are nearing the top.

3994
03:10:54.823 --> 03:10:57.116
SAM: What the fuck are those things?
LAURA: Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

3995
03:10:59.639 --> 03:11:01.314
They're Uk'otoa people!

3996
03:11:01.314 --> 03:11:04.692
MATT: They all look humanoid, but they have fish-like fins

3997
03:11:04.692 --> 03:11:07.247
on their forearms and across the head.

3998
03:11:07.247 --> 03:11:09.053
Some of them look kind of wrong

3999
03:11:09.053 --> 03:11:11.510
or, like, one arm is a weird tentacle and is (sucking sound)

4000
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:12.655
climbing up the side

4001
03:11:12.655 --> 03:11:15.455
and they're all almost to the top of the deck.

4002
03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:21.011
You guys are all still sleeping.
ASHLEY: Do we hear anything?

4003
03:11:21.011 --> 03:11:22.752
SAM: Is the ship moving?
MATT: I will say,

4004
03:11:22.752 --> 03:11:24.393
oh yeah, the ship is rocking.

4005
03:11:24.393 --> 03:11:27.718
SAM: But, like, is Fjord drifting away or--?

4006
03:11:27.718 --> 03:11:31.032
MATT: He will be. I mean, it's not a speedboat or anything.

4007
03:11:31.032 --> 03:11:32.290
TRAVIS: I can pop back in.

4008
03:11:32.290 --> 03:11:34.605
MATT: In six seconds, he can
teleport back in, so I'm not too worried.

4009
03:11:34.605 --> 03:11:36.061
All right.

4010
03:11:36.061 --> 03:11:37.423
So that's the top of the round.

4011
03:11:37.423 --> 03:11:38.797
I'm going to go ahead and roll initiative for them now.

4012
03:11:38.797 --> 03:11:40.505
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

4013
03:11:41.512 --> 03:11:43.262
LAURA: We need to wake up.

4014
03:11:44.538 --> 03:11:49.280
ASHLEY: They need to stomp on the deck. Wake us up.

4015
03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:51.613
(thunder rumbling)

4016
03:11:53.031 --> 03:11:54.739
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

4017
03:11:55.693 --> 03:11:57.800
MATT: All righty.
SAM: Who is that?

4018
03:11:57.800 --> 03:12:00.942
MATT: So, top of the round.

4019
03:12:00.942 --> 03:12:02.012
TRAVIS: My face is stinging.

4020
03:12:02.012 --> 03:12:03.095
MATT: This entity

4021
03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:08.480
breaks through the window and glances off the side, looking

4022
03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:11.578
at you, down at the ocean. You see it curl around

4023
03:12:11.578 --> 03:12:15.440
the corner after the glass sprays out the back of it.

4024
03:12:15.440 --> 03:12:18.088
LAURA: The poor Ball-Eater!

4025
03:12:18.088 --> 03:12:22.810
MATT: It's going to go ahead and cast Eldritch Blast at you.

4026
03:12:22.810 --> 03:12:23.643
(gasping)

4027
03:12:23.643 --> 03:12:25.959
LAURA: This motherfucker!

4028
03:12:25.959 --> 03:12:27.992
SAM: (slow drawl) Eldritch blast.

4029
03:12:27.992 --> 03:12:30.553
MATT: That is hilariously--

4030
03:12:32.390 --> 03:12:34.783
that's a 10! That's your AC, right?

4031
03:12:34.783 --> 03:12:36.001
TRAVIS: It is.
MATT: It hits you.

4032
03:12:36.001 --> 03:12:37.717
MARISHA: Oh, jeez.

4033
03:12:39.420 --> 03:12:42.190
TRAVIS: It's not like I was going to get dressed.
MATT: That's a nine

4034
03:12:42.190 --> 03:12:45.200
and that is a 20, so you get hit twice.

4035
03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:46.245
TRAVIS: Wow.

4036
03:12:46.245 --> 03:12:48.445
LAURA: Oh no. Oh no!

4037
03:12:48.445 --> 03:12:50.661
MATT: So you take--
LAURA: Don't die on the water!

4038
03:12:50.661 --> 03:12:52.611
MATT: --17 points of force damage

4039
03:12:52.611 --> 03:12:57.602
as the creature comes out and throws these three blasts.

4040
03:12:57.602 --> 03:13:00.175
One hits you in the shoulder, the other you dive below

4041
03:13:00.175 --> 03:13:02.630
and it misses you, and you stand there for a second feel one

4042
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:04.780
that actually goes through the ocean below

4043
03:13:04.780 --> 03:13:07.296
and strikes you in the side of the hip and the leg.

4044
03:13:07.296 --> 03:13:09.021
ALL: Ooh.

4045
03:13:09.021 --> 03:13:10.563
MATT: Now it's your turn, Fjord.

4046
03:13:10.563 --> 03:13:11.913
TRAVIS: Now it's my turn.

4047
03:13:12.936 --> 03:13:14.436
I will shout out:

4048
03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:17.990
Intruders!

4049
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:21.231
And I will use my bonus action to

4050
03:13:21.231 --> 03:13:23.564
60 feet onto the main deck,

4051
03:13:23.564 --> 03:13:24.987
past Orly, if I can.

4052
03:13:24.987 --> 03:13:26.020
MATT: Up here?
TRAVIS: Yep.

4053
03:13:26.020 --> 03:13:28.223
MATT: All right, there you are.

4054
03:13:28.223 --> 03:13:29.481
TRAVIS: Um.

4055
03:13:32.314 --> 03:13:33.334
Boy.

4056
03:13:33.334 --> 03:13:34.592
Boy, boy, boy.

4057
03:13:37.296 --> 03:13:39.350
And I can't-- none of them are peeking over the side

4058
03:13:39.350 --> 03:13:41.645
of the railing yet, right? They're
just climbing up the side?

4059
03:13:41.645 --> 03:13:44.650
MATT: Correct. They're, like, maybe about

4060
03:13:44.650 --> 03:13:46.470
five to ten feet from the edge.

4061
03:13:46.470 --> 03:13:48.865
TRAVIS: I'll use my action to scream as loud as I can:

4062
03:13:48.865 --> 03:13:50.938
Everybody wake the fuck up!

4063
03:13:50.938 --> 03:13:52.711
MATT: There is a bell that hangs there for--

4064
03:13:52.711 --> 03:13:54.318
TRAVIS: That works! (clanging)

4065
03:13:54.318 --> 03:13:56.698
MATT: All right, so you have to use your movement over here,

4066
03:13:56.698 --> 03:13:58.867
go ahead and grab the bell and start clanging it.

4067
03:13:58.867 --> 03:14:01.488
Everyone in the upper floor here,

4068
03:14:01.488 --> 03:14:03.970
you all begin to hear the bell

4069
03:14:03.970 --> 03:14:06.311
and so you all start coming to consciousness.

4070
03:14:06.311 --> 03:14:09.419
LAURA: (yawning) What's that mean? Is it dinner time?
MATT: Nobody's in the bottom floor, so you guys are good.

4071
03:14:09.419 --> 03:14:13.658
So everybody else, you begin to come to consciousness.

4072
03:14:13.658 --> 03:14:16.411
So we'll have you roll initiative at the end of this round.

4073
03:14:16.411 --> 03:14:18.444
(groaning)

4074
03:14:18.444 --> 03:14:19.920
MATT: All righty.

4075
03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:20.836
The bell starts happening.

4076
03:14:20.836 --> 03:14:25.336
Some of the other crew members start waking up as well.

4077
03:14:26.580 --> 03:14:28.160
Gets up,

4078
03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:29.576
gets up.

4079
03:14:31.330 --> 03:14:33.470
That's-- Marius is up there.

4080
03:14:33.470 --> 03:14:36.028
This is a proxy for

4081
03:14:37.908 --> 03:14:40.075
Shelda and then

4082
03:14:40.075 --> 03:14:43.779
that there is-- I'm representing as Gallan.

4083
03:14:43.779 --> 03:14:44.787
SAM: Gallan.

4084
03:14:45.745 --> 03:14:46.578
MATT: So...

4085
03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:50.620
after Fjord finishes your turn,

4086
03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:52.120
these creatures all

4087
03:14:53.100 --> 03:14:56.586
reach the top, leap over the edge. Oh god.

4088
03:14:56.586 --> 03:14:58.073
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh god!

4089
03:14:58.073 --> 03:15:02.548
MATT: Yep. Leap over the edge there
and leap over the edge here.

4090
03:15:04.103 --> 03:15:06.044
(thunder crashes)

4091
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:11.153
MATT: This one here, you can see,
is covered in these large quills

4092
03:15:11.153 --> 03:15:14.880
on its back. These, like, weird spines that

4093
03:15:14.880 --> 03:15:17.084
all of a sudden, with a flex, protrude even further

4094
03:15:17.084 --> 03:15:19.820
and it flexes its chest as one bends

4095
03:15:19.820 --> 03:15:21.936
and fires out towards Marius.

4096
03:15:21.936 --> 03:15:23.375
SAM: Cool.

4097
03:15:23.375 --> 03:15:24.383
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Wow.

4098
03:15:24.383 --> 03:15:25.966
MATT: Oh yeah, that hits.
TRAVIS: Wow.

4099
03:15:27.407 --> 03:15:29.687
MATT: Marius takes

4100
03:15:29.687 --> 03:15:32.472
nine points of poison damage,

4101
03:15:32.472 --> 03:15:35.384
and has to make a constitution saving throw.

4102
03:15:35.384 --> 03:15:37.942
Fails! Marius is poisoned.

4103
03:15:40.939 --> 03:15:42.157
SAM: Oh no!

4104
03:15:42.157 --> 03:15:45.473
MATT: All right. The one over there is
going to attempt to fire a quill.

4105
03:15:46.771 --> 03:15:49.430
Well, it still has to be close to you.

4106
03:15:49.430 --> 03:15:50.928
It's going to, after the rest of its movement,

4107
03:15:50.928 --> 03:15:53.965
it just barely manages to get up close enough to you, Fjord,

4108
03:15:53.965 --> 03:15:56.050
to catch up to you and then does the same thing

4109
03:15:56.050 --> 03:15:58.966
and releases a quill from its chest towards you.

4110
03:16:00.106 --> 03:16:01.381
It's cocked.

4111
03:16:02.670 --> 03:16:03.762
That's, ooh,

4112
03:16:03.762 --> 03:16:05.805
that's a critical again, that's a natural twenty.

4113
03:16:05.805 --> 03:16:06.988
TRAVIS: Damn!

4114
03:16:08.610 --> 03:16:10.163
MATT: Oh, but you're a lucky son of a bitch.

4115
03:16:10.163 --> 03:16:13.303
Rolled the two. So that's four points of poison damage.

4116
03:16:13.303 --> 03:16:14.136
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: And

4117
03:16:14.136 --> 03:16:15.497
I need you to make a
constitution saving throw for me.

4118
03:16:15.497 --> 03:16:16.330
TRAVIS: Okay.

4119
03:16:18.260 --> 03:16:19.093
18.

4120
03:16:19.093 --> 03:16:20.576
MATT: 18, you're fine.
SAM: Yeah!

4121
03:16:21.613 --> 03:16:23.821
TRAVIS: What's that do? Uh oh.

4122
03:16:27.253 --> 03:16:30.298
MATT: So as things are getting more and more intense,

4123
03:16:30.298 --> 03:16:31.386
so does the music.

4124
03:16:31.386 --> 03:16:32.527
LAURA: Gulp!

4125
03:16:33.665 --> 03:16:36.702
(intense timpani)

4126
03:16:36.702 --> 03:16:40.092
TRAVIS: This is fucking dope!
MARISHA: This is fucking dope, I know!

4127
03:16:40.092 --> 03:16:41.263
MATT: All right.

4128
03:16:41.263 --> 03:16:43.646
MARISHA: (chanting) Ship fight, ship fight, ship fight!

4129
03:16:45.627 --> 03:16:47.851
MATT: Crawling through--

4130
03:16:47.851 --> 03:16:48.805
LAURA: (gasps)
SAM: Ahh!

4131
03:16:48.805 --> 03:16:49.713
LIAM: Ooh!

4132
03:16:49.713 --> 03:16:52.884
MATT: -- the gun holes where the cannons are,

4133
03:16:52.884 --> 03:16:54.422
you see, Nott, as you're in the hammock

4134
03:16:54.422 --> 03:16:56.151
and you hear the bells and look over your edge

4135
03:16:56.151 --> 03:16:58.840
you could see the wooden slats that usually close them

4136
03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:02.366
are now open as these weird creatures are

4137
03:17:02.366 --> 03:17:05.757
slithering through and then landing onto the gun deck.

4138
03:17:05.757 --> 03:17:08.257
MARISHA: I just battened down those hatches.

4139
03:17:11.020 --> 03:17:14.745
SAM: Whoever battened down these hatches
did a shitty job of it!

4140
03:17:14.745 --> 03:17:17.845
MARISHA: Fucking Marius, goddamn it.

4141
03:17:17.845 --> 03:17:20.180
SAM: Is that a different one or just a different--?

4142
03:17:20.180 --> 03:17:21.463
MATT: That's a different one.

4143
03:17:21.463 --> 03:17:22.644
MARISHA: He looks real fancy.

4144
03:17:22.644 --> 03:17:24.642
LAURA: Oh, I don't like him at all.

4145
03:17:24.642 --> 03:17:26.789
SAM: These are creepy crawlies.

4146
03:17:26.789 --> 03:17:29.623
MATT: You're on that side and there's another here.

4147
03:17:29.623 --> 03:17:31.431
SAM: Oh boy, guys, I'm surrounded.

4148
03:17:31.431 --> 03:17:35.170
MATT: The ones that are standing like this
all have one tentacle arm.

4149
03:17:35.170 --> 03:17:37.762
The smaller ones have the quills.

4150
03:17:37.762 --> 03:17:41.312
This one here has the grayish blue skin,

4151
03:17:41.312 --> 03:17:42.787
has this long, tattered robe.

4152
03:17:42.787 --> 03:17:44.782
Similar to the one you had, but was not as well-dressed

4153
03:17:44.782 --> 03:17:46.792
and as intense-looking,

4154
03:17:46.792 --> 03:17:49.008
but it does have, where its mouth is, it has this weird

4155
03:17:49.008 --> 03:17:52.949
open, double-split on each side and like (tongue wagging).

4156
03:17:52.949 --> 03:17:55.916
TRAVIS: (groans) Oh, the flexing!

4157
03:17:55.916 --> 03:17:58.020
(tongue wagging)

4158
03:17:58.020 --> 03:18:00.155
MATT: So they just get in there.
TRAVIS: Terrible.

4159
03:18:01.553 --> 03:18:03.822
MATT: The crew's going to take their turn now.

4160
03:18:03.822 --> 03:18:07.422
Orly is going to go ahead and

4161
03:18:09.113 --> 03:18:12.710
he's going to go ahead and cast--

4162
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:15.651
Let's see. Do these count as humanoid? Yeah, it does.

4163
03:18:15.651 --> 03:18:18.217
Orly's going to go ahead and cast Charm Person

4164
03:18:18.217 --> 03:18:22.735
on the two that are visible right there at 2nd-level.

4165
03:18:22.735 --> 03:18:25.473
Uses a 2nd-level slot.

4166
03:18:25.473 --> 03:18:28.006
Saving throw for each of those.
TRAVIS: -- to Charm Person.

4167
03:18:28.006 --> 03:18:29.947
MATT: That one fails.

4168
03:18:29.947 --> 03:18:31.483
TRAVIS: Nice.

4169
03:18:31.483 --> 03:18:33.063
MATT: That one does succeed, the one by you.

4170
03:18:33.063 --> 03:18:37.302
But the one that's in front of Orly is now currently

4171
03:18:37.302 --> 03:18:39.126
treating you--

4172
03:18:39.126 --> 03:18:41.558
Orly, at least-- as an ally.

4173
03:18:41.558 --> 03:18:45.148
And has gone from an aggressive stance to a (calm breath).

4174
03:18:45.148 --> 03:18:47.307
And is just standing there, looking around,

4175
03:18:47.307 --> 03:18:49.390
a bit confused with the current scenario.

4176
03:18:49.390 --> 03:18:53.737
With that, Orly's going to go ahead and dart back a bit,

4177
03:18:53.737 --> 03:18:55.462
and try and back up to the side of the ship

4178
03:18:55.462 --> 03:18:57.918
to take a gauge of what's happening,

4179
03:18:57.918 --> 03:19:01.805
while drawing a shortsword from the side.

4180
03:19:01.805 --> 03:19:04.420
With that, Marius is going to go ahead and attempt to

4181
03:19:04.420 --> 03:19:06.745
make two attacks with a longsword against the guy.

4182
03:19:06.745 --> 03:19:09.307
That hits,

4183
03:19:09.307 --> 03:19:10.277
indeed!

4184
03:19:10.277 --> 03:19:11.568
Second attack.

4185
03:19:12.494 --> 03:19:14.077
Misses with a three.

4186
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:20.193
Aw, buddy.

4187
03:19:21.213 --> 03:19:23.200
Does

4188
03:19:23.200 --> 03:19:25.360
five damage to the guy in front of him.

4189
03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:27.141
LAURA: Aw.

4190
03:19:27.141 --> 03:19:28.631
MATT: Yeah.

4191
03:19:28.631 --> 03:19:31.163
He is-- Oh, and he's poisoned, so he has
disadvantage on the attacks.

4192
03:19:31.163 --> 03:19:34.008
Actually, the first one misses.

4193
03:19:34.008 --> 03:19:34.841
Second one

4194
03:19:34.841 --> 03:19:35.960
does hit still, so it's fine.

4195
03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:38.153
So it all worked out well in the end.

4196
03:19:38.153 --> 03:19:39.061
That finishes the round.

4197
03:19:39.061 --> 03:19:41.540
Everybody else roll initiative now, please.

4198
03:19:41.540 --> 03:19:43.990
TRAVIS: Help! Help!

4199
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:45.252
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake.

4200
03:19:45.252 --> 03:19:48.319
MATT: All right, so 25 to 20?

4201
03:19:48.319 --> 03:19:49.310
MARISHA: Hang on.

4202
03:19:49.310 --> 03:19:50.157
TALIESIN: Gross.

4203
03:19:50.157 --> 03:19:51.457
MARISHA: What's my initiative?

4204
03:19:52.807 --> 03:19:55.332
25 to 20? I'm going to roll a d8 for this one,

4205
03:19:55.332 --> 03:19:57.397
use my boots.

4206
03:19:57.397 --> 03:19:58.647
Not that great.

4207
03:20:02.192 --> 03:20:03.625
No, okay.

4208
03:20:03.625 --> 03:20:04.675
MATT: Nobody?

4209
03:20:04.675 --> 03:20:05.844
MARISHA: No.

4210
03:20:05.844 --> 03:20:07.485
MATT: Okay, 25 to 20.

4211
03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:11.257
20 to 15.

4212
03:20:11.257 --> 03:20:12.427
LAURA: 19.
MARISHA: 18.

4213
03:20:12.427 --> 03:20:13.260
MATT: 19?

4214
03:20:14.237 --> 03:20:15.124
All right.

4215
03:20:15.124 --> 03:20:17.398
(solemn music)

4216
03:20:17.398 --> 03:20:18.781
SAM: What to do.

4217
03:20:19.937 --> 03:20:21.028
MATT: Beau, you said 18?

4218
03:20:21.028 --> 03:20:22.011
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4219
03:20:22.011 --> 03:20:23.653
Anybody else?

4220
03:20:23.653 --> 03:20:24.711
15 to 10.

4221
03:20:24.711 --> 03:20:25.544
LIAM: 10.
ASHLEY: 13.

4222
03:20:25.544 --> 03:20:27.759
TRAVIS: This is your first fight as a halfling, right?

4223
03:20:27.759 --> 03:20:28.767
SAM: Yeah.

4224
03:20:28.767 --> 03:20:30.358
I don't have a lot of--

4225
03:20:30.358 --> 03:20:33.155
I don't have any area of effect attacks.

4226
03:20:33.155 --> 03:20:34.794
LAURA: What'd roll, Fjord? What was your initiative?

4227
03:20:34.794 --> 03:20:36.310
MATT: 15 to 10.
LIAM: 10.

4228
03:20:36.310 --> 03:20:38.032
MATT: 10 for Caleb.

4229
03:20:38.032 --> 03:20:39.826
(intense electric guitar music)

4230
03:20:39.826 --> 03:20:42.103
SAM: (drum rhythm)
LAURA: Ooh!

4231
03:20:42.103 --> 03:20:43.238
MARISHA: You were 15?

4232
03:20:43.238 --> 03:20:44.071
TRAVIS: Yep.

4233
03:20:44.071 --> 03:20:45.585
MATT: All right. 10 to five?

4234
03:20:45.585 --> 03:20:46.672
TALIESIN: Eight.
SAM: Eight.

4235
03:20:46.672 --> 03:20:48.372
LAURA: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Eyy.

4236
03:20:50.447 --> 03:20:52.468
MATT: Cad and Veth.

4237
03:20:52.468 --> 03:20:55.180
You got it. All right, Jester, you are up first.

4238
03:20:55.180 --> 03:20:57.185
LAURA: (startled groan)
MATT: You hear the bell going off.

4239
03:20:57.185 --> 03:20:58.793
You hear some movement upstairs.

4240
03:20:58.793 --> 03:21:03.167
The ship's rocking and you're just, "What is going on?!"

4241
03:21:03.167 --> 03:21:05.150
LAURA: I sit up.

4242
03:21:05.150 --> 03:21:09.740
MATT: Uses half your movement getting up out of bed.

4243
03:21:09.740 --> 03:21:12.030
LAURA: I see this weird thing in front of me and--

4244
03:21:12.030 --> 03:21:14.246
MATT: Well, this is-- sorry. To let you know,

4245
03:21:14.246 --> 03:21:17.042
these are rooms. So you guys are in rooms here.

4246
03:21:17.042 --> 03:21:20.001
LAURA: Oh, I thought we were all
just, like, out in the open.

4247
03:21:20.001 --> 03:21:23.832
MATT: No, sorry. You guys all are in
different rooms here, separately,

4248
03:21:23.832 --> 03:21:26.739
and this are little doors. The little white elements

4249
03:21:26.739 --> 03:21:28.360
there are the walls.

4250
03:21:28.360 --> 03:21:29.820
So right now, you don't know what's going on,

4251
03:21:29.820 --> 03:21:31.135
all you hear is the bell ringing.

4252
03:21:31.135 --> 03:21:33.609
LAURA: Okay, so I'll get up and I walk out the door.

4253
03:21:33.609 --> 03:21:35.926
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: What's going on here? (screams)

4254
03:21:35.926 --> 03:21:38.508
MATT: Down the hall way and immediately, you see

4255
03:21:38.508 --> 03:21:41.090
the edge of something weird here and then a lot of these

4256
03:21:41.090 --> 03:21:45.122
from eye line, you can really only see these two, maybe.

4257
03:21:45.122 --> 03:21:47.500
Actually, you'd probably get about there before you'd see.

4258
03:21:47.500 --> 03:21:49.283
One, two.

4259
03:21:49.283 --> 03:21:51.247
One, two,

4260
03:21:51.247 --> 03:21:53.240
three. You can get about there, I'd say.

4261
03:21:53.240 --> 03:21:55.733
Now you can see Nott there in the middle the room,

4262
03:21:55.733 --> 03:21:58.450
looking over and reacting to all these creatures

4263
03:21:58.450 --> 03:22:00.942
that have filtered in from the gun deck openings.

4264
03:22:00.942 --> 03:22:02.183
What are you doing?
LAURA: Oh god.

4265
03:22:06.230 --> 03:22:09.910
Oh god, okay. Well, the thing I was going to do is

4266
03:22:09.910 --> 03:22:12.227
a little bit, is a little bit much.

4267
03:22:15.743 --> 03:22:17.833
I'm going to do it.

4268
03:22:17.833 --> 03:22:18.675
MATT: What you doing?

4269
03:22:18.675 --> 03:22:21.874
LAURA: I'm going to do (uncertain noise) a

4270
03:22:21.874 --> 03:22:23.551
Blade Barrier.

4271
03:22:23.551 --> 03:22:24.809
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4272
03:22:26.768 --> 03:22:28.601
LAURA: And I'm going to cast it.

4273
03:22:31.433 --> 03:22:34.633
It's a 100-foot straight wall,

4274
03:22:34.633 --> 03:22:36.058
but I'm guessing I get to choose,

4275
03:22:36.058 --> 03:22:39.843
like, where I want it to be. Right?

4276
03:22:39.843 --> 03:22:42.315
MATT: Yeah. "A vertical wall of whirling, sharp blades."

4277
03:22:42.315 --> 03:22:44.134
LAURA: 20 feet high.

4278
03:22:44.134 --> 03:22:45.375
SAM: Whoa.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

4279
03:22:45.375 --> 03:22:46.998
MATT: "Make a straight wall up to 100 feet long,

4280
03:22:46.998 --> 03:22:48.728
"20 feet high, and five feet thick

4281
03:22:48.728 --> 03:22:50.498
"or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter."

4282
03:22:50.498 --> 03:22:51.481
SAM: Ringed wall.

4283
03:22:51.481 --> 03:22:52.822
LAURA: Well, but I would ring you

4284
03:22:52.822 --> 03:22:54.256
and then you wouldn't be able to get out.

4285
03:22:54.256 --> 03:22:55.227
SAM: Oh, I'll be fine.

4286
03:22:55.227 --> 03:22:56.310
MATT: All right, so what're you doing?

4287
03:22:56.310 --> 03:22:57.143
LAURA: I'm going to--

4288
03:22:57.143 --> 03:22:59.500
Are these the only ways to get upstairs?

4289
03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:00.922
MATT: Correct, yeah.

4290
03:23:00.922 --> 03:23:02.263
LAURA: Okay.

4291
03:23:02.263 --> 03:23:06.015
I'm going to cast a barrier from starting at this guy,

4292
03:23:06.015 --> 03:23:08.782
I'm just going to bring it out like that and end it

4293
03:23:08.782 --> 03:23:12.089
across here to where we still have access

4294
03:23:12.089 --> 03:23:15.190
on the side. Those ones would be not in it.

4295
03:23:15.190 --> 03:23:17.632
MATT: Okay, so we will say--

4296
03:23:17.632 --> 03:23:19.845
SAM: Like, is he in the middle of the wall?

4297
03:23:19.845 --> 03:23:21.648
The guy in front of you?

4298
03:23:21.648 --> 03:23:22.948
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: I'm just marking this,

4299
03:23:22.948 --> 03:23:24.657
a wall is about here is where it goes.

4300
03:23:24.657 --> 03:23:25.758
LAURA: Yeah.

4301
03:23:25.758 --> 03:23:26.591
MATT: Okay.

4302
03:23:27.620 --> 03:23:30.204
So as you summon it,

4303
03:23:30.204 --> 03:23:33.443
LAURA: That's a bad placement for it. I already did it.

4304
03:23:33.443 --> 03:23:36.577
MATT: This five-foot wall
thick of blades whirling and spinning

4305
03:23:36.577 --> 03:23:38.593
starts thrashing through,

4306
03:23:39.768 --> 03:23:41.512
rending all the creatures in this space,

4307
03:23:41.512 --> 03:23:43.944
as well as all the cannons.

4308
03:23:43.944 --> 03:23:45.852
LAURA: (gasps)

4309
03:23:45.852 --> 03:23:48.985
I didn't know it was-- I thought it was just creatures!

4310
03:23:48.985 --> 03:23:50.376
SAM: Oh well.
LAURA: Anything--

4311
03:23:50.376 --> 03:23:51.808
when a <i>creature</i> enters the wall.

4312
03:23:51.808 --> 03:23:54.533
It didn't say any thing about cannons!

4313
03:23:54.533 --> 03:23:57.380
MATT: Well, Fireball doesn't say anything about, you know,

4314
03:23:57.380 --> 03:24:00.552
blowing up trees, necessarily,
but if you threw Fireball on a tree--

4315
03:24:00.552 --> 03:24:01.385
LAURA: (unhappy noise)

4316
03:24:01.385 --> 03:24:04.237
MATT: It's fine. The cannons are made of metal,

4317
03:24:04.237 --> 03:24:05.283
they're going to be fine.

4318
03:24:05.283 --> 03:24:09.023
The wheels are going to be probably destroyed.

4319
03:24:09.023 --> 03:24:10.165
They're going to be a little harder to move and aim.

4320
03:24:10.165 --> 03:24:12.930
SAM: My cannons!
ASHLEY: It's fixable.

4321
03:24:12.930 --> 03:24:14.426
MATT: That's okay, though.

4322
03:24:14.426 --> 03:24:16.157
TRAVIS: (like Nott) My cannons!

4323
03:24:16.157 --> 03:24:18.890
MATT: But the wall is up. That's your action.

4324
03:24:18.890 --> 03:24:20.815
LAURA: Did I get-- I got that guy in it, too. Right?

4325
03:24:20.815 --> 03:24:21.648
MATT: Correct, yeah.

4326
03:24:21.648 --> 03:24:24.387
They're all in that space there.
TRAVIS: What a great marker for that, too.

4327
03:24:24.387 --> 03:24:26.043
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's cool.

4328
03:24:26.043 --> 03:24:28.891
LAURA: What a fucking dumbass spell I just did. Whatever.

4329
03:24:28.891 --> 03:24:30.499
ASHLEY: No, you didn't. It was very cool.

4330
03:24:30.499 --> 03:24:32.837
TRAVIS: You're learning, you're learning.
SAM: You did great!

4331
03:24:32.837 --> 03:24:35.538
MATT: All right, is that your turn?
LAURA: (strange uncertain sounds)

4332
03:24:35.538 --> 03:24:39.142
I'm going to-- I don't have any more movement?
Is that all my movement?

4333
03:24:39.142 --> 03:24:41.168
MATT: That's all your movement.
LAURA: Okay.

4334
03:24:41.168 --> 03:24:43.133
MATT: All right. Beauregard, you're up.

4335
03:24:43.133 --> 03:24:46.203
MARISHA: Captain! I wake up and--

4336
03:24:46.203 --> 03:24:48.230
MATT: Half your movement to get up.

4337
03:24:48.230 --> 03:24:50.230
MARISHA: I come out.
MATT: Come out in the hallway.

4338
03:24:52.152 --> 03:24:55.665
Or you can get just in front of Jester, if you want to.

4339
03:24:55.665 --> 03:24:57.603
You just see this large wall of blades

4340
03:24:57.603 --> 03:24:58.760
and creatures starting to swarm.

4341
03:24:58.760 --> 03:25:00.222
MARISHA: And I just crash into Jester

4342
03:25:00.222 --> 03:25:01.405
and I'm like: What's happening?

4343
03:25:01.405 --> 03:25:03.832
LAURA: I don't know! I'm attacking things!

4344
03:25:03.832 --> 03:25:06.007
MARISHA: What?! I'm going to run upstairs!

4345
03:25:06.007 --> 03:25:08.129
TRAVIS: (laughing) I'm attacking things.

4346
03:25:08.129 --> 03:25:12.077
MARISHA: Step of the Wind! I'm going
to try and squeeze past Jester

4347
03:25:12.077 --> 03:25:15.161
and bolt upstairs with another 50 feet of movement.

4348
03:25:15.161 --> 03:25:15.994
MATT: Okay.

4349
03:25:17.230 --> 03:25:18.597
SAM: Oh, that's where the stairs are?

4350
03:25:18.597 --> 03:25:19.430
LAURA: Yeah.

4351
03:25:20.410 --> 03:25:21.802
MATT: 40-- you said 50 feet?

4352
03:25:21.802 --> 03:25:23.373
MARISHA: Yeah.

4353
03:25:23.373 --> 03:25:25.606
MATT: That'll get you just out

4354
03:25:25.606 --> 03:25:28.066
to here, I'll say.

4355
03:25:28.066 --> 03:25:30.229
MARISHA: Captain--
MATT: You do suffer

4356
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:33.157
two, three attacks of opportunity as you rush through.

4357
03:25:33.157 --> 03:25:34.340
MARISHA: That's okay.

4358
03:25:35.348 --> 03:25:36.848
MATT: Step of the Wind...?

4359
03:25:37.812 --> 03:25:41.624
MARISHA: Step of the Wind, no, I think that-- well, wait...

4360
03:25:41.624 --> 03:25:44.550
MATT: Just making sure there's
nothing weird there about that.

4361
03:25:44.550 --> 03:25:46.250
MARISHA: You're right.

4362
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:47.463
MATT: Monks are weird.

4363
03:25:47.463 --> 03:25:49.407
MARISHA: I can either disengage or--

4364
03:25:49.407 --> 03:25:51.550
MATT: Okay, disengage or the dash. Okay, so you dashed.

4365
03:25:51.550 --> 03:25:55.483
All right, so that in mind,

4366
03:25:59.820 --> 03:26:03.170
you go ahead and suffer from...

4367
03:26:03.170 --> 03:26:04.460
MARISHA: Hit me.

4368
03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:06.927
TALIESIN: ♪ With your best shot. ♪

4369
03:26:06.927 --> 03:26:10.973
MATT: It's going to strike at you
with-- it has a blade in one hand.

4370
03:26:10.973 --> 03:26:13.804
That is a 22 to hit.

4371
03:26:13.804 --> 03:26:14.637
MARISHA: Yes.

4372
03:26:14.637 --> 03:26:15.470
MATT: All right.

4373
03:26:16.835 --> 03:26:20.137
You suffer six points of slashing damage.

4374
03:26:20.137 --> 03:26:21.743
MARISHA: Okay.

4375
03:26:21.743 --> 03:26:25.213
MATT: Plus four points of necrotic

4376
03:26:25.213 --> 03:26:28.088
from this rusty-looking blade.

4377
03:26:29.390 --> 03:26:32.281
The two others there, they're going to strike at you,

4378
03:26:32.281 --> 03:26:33.950
one with a tentacle and

4379
03:26:33.950 --> 03:26:37.210
one with unarmed strike.

4380
03:26:37.210 --> 03:26:40.252
Unarmed strike-- oof, no, that misses.

4381
03:26:40.252 --> 03:26:43.998
The one with the tentacle, that's
going to be a 16, which misses.

4382
03:26:43.998 --> 03:26:45.977
So you just dart by and head up there.

4383
03:26:45.977 --> 03:26:48.988
So that's your movement and your bonus action.

4384
03:26:48.988 --> 03:26:50.538
MARISHA: Yes.

4385
03:26:56.780 --> 03:26:58.588
Am I able--?

4386
03:26:58.588 --> 03:27:01.802
Can I, like, survey the scene?

4387
03:27:01.802 --> 03:27:03.900
I used my movement and my bonus action.

4388
03:27:03.900 --> 03:27:05.800
MATT: I'd say you can see up here because you just got

4389
03:27:05.800 --> 03:27:08.267
out here and that's above you and it's blocking your vision,

4390
03:27:08.267 --> 03:27:10.767
so you don't see where Fjord is.
You don't see the creature with it.

4391
03:27:10.767 --> 03:27:11.950
Up here, you can see this creature.

4392
03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:13.563
You can see Marius curtained in with this.

4393
03:27:13.563 --> 03:27:17.083
You can see Orly, who's just backing away

4394
03:27:17.083 --> 03:27:19.457
and glances over to notice you, with his one eye.

4395
03:27:19.457 --> 03:27:23.385
MARISHA: I'll use the rest of my movement again

4396
03:27:23.385 --> 03:27:28.285
to get in-between Orly and come and help fucking Marius.

4397
03:27:28.285 --> 03:27:31.640
MATT: You got it. So you dart up and join in with that

4398
03:27:31.640 --> 03:27:33.775
creature right there and hold it in place. You got it.

4399
03:27:33.775 --> 03:27:36.950
All right, finishing Beau's turn, it is now this guy's turn.

4400
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:40.051
Climbs up the side of the ship.

4401
03:27:40.051 --> 03:27:43.231
Before landing on top and just (thuds).

4402
03:27:43.231 --> 03:27:46.789
(grunts) Comes over onto the rain slick surface

4403
03:27:48.648 --> 03:27:52.173
at the top of the upper deck there
and is going to go ahead and

4404
03:27:55.040 --> 03:27:59.046
use its action to cast Armor of Agathys.

4405
03:27:59.046 --> 03:27:59.879
TRAVIS: Wow.

4406
03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:04.336
MATT: You now watch as--
MARISHA: What if it's, like, nega-Fjord?

4407
03:28:04.336 --> 03:28:05.437
TRAVIS: That would be crazy.

4408
03:28:05.437 --> 03:28:09.203
MATT: You watch as the rain water that spattering across it

4409
03:28:09.203 --> 03:28:12.842
suddenly (cracking) and all the rain water starts gathering

4410
03:28:12.842 --> 03:28:16.083
as chunks of ice until eventually it creates these spines,

4411
03:28:16.083 --> 03:28:19.255
these jagged quills of frozen water

4412
03:28:19.255 --> 03:28:22.063
and with every raindrop that hits, it only adds

4413
03:28:22.063 --> 03:28:23.700
more and more to it.

4414
03:28:23.700 --> 03:28:25.851
TRAVIS: That's a dope visual, but okay.

4415
03:28:25.851 --> 03:28:27.059
(laughter)

4416
03:28:27.059 --> 03:28:28.109
MATT: And it's going to use the rest of

4417
03:28:28.109 --> 03:28:29.915
the movement to just move right there.

4418
03:28:29.915 --> 03:28:30.993
TRAVIS: Jester, Beau.

4419
03:28:30.993 --> 03:28:32.707
Who is-- was there somebody before Jester?

4420
03:28:32.707 --> 03:28:33.707
SAM: Not me.

4421
03:28:33.707 --> 03:28:37.265
MATT: Now it's Fjord's turn, and then
it's Yasha. You're on deck.

4422
03:28:37.265 --> 03:28:41.300
TRAVIS: I will take one step away from-- no, he's in melee

4423
03:28:41.300 --> 03:28:42.450
with me, isn't he?

4424
03:28:42.450 --> 03:28:43.283
MATT: Correct.

4425
03:28:43.283 --> 03:28:47.332
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action to try something crazy.

4426
03:28:47.332 --> 03:28:49.695
I'm going to try and Far Step--

4427
03:28:49.695 --> 03:28:52.020
MATT: Oh, just as a note, too, before I forget.

4428
03:28:52.020 --> 03:28:53.373
Make a constitution saving throw.

4429
03:28:53.373 --> 03:28:55.013
TRAVIS: Oh right, because the spine?

4430
03:28:55.013 --> 03:28:55.846
MATT: Yep.

4431
03:28:58.160 --> 03:28:58.993
TRAVIS: 13.

4432
03:28:58.993 --> 03:29:00.210
MATT: 13 is fine.

4433
03:29:00.210 --> 03:29:02.493
It was a DC of 10. Didn't do a lot of damage to you.

4434
03:29:02.493 --> 03:29:04.663
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and use my bonus action to use

4435
03:29:04.663 --> 03:29:09.575
Far Step to go 60 feet up onto this mast onto this buckle

4436
03:29:09.575 --> 03:29:13.225
and hold onto the main mast.

4437
03:29:13.225 --> 03:29:16.156
MATT: You got it.
TALIESIN: Not even going for the crow's nest.

4438
03:29:16.156 --> 03:29:18.270
TRAVIS: I don't think I can get there in 60 feet.

4439
03:29:18.270 --> 03:29:21.561
This is more than 60 feet from there, right?

4440
03:29:21.561 --> 03:29:24.640
MATT: I'd say it's upwards, like, 70 feet or higher.

4441
03:29:24.640 --> 03:29:25.957
TRAVIS: I'll just go halfway.

4442
03:29:25.957 --> 03:29:27.977
LAURA: Ooh, cool.

4443
03:29:27.977 --> 03:29:29.685
MATT: About there, we'll say.
MARISHA: Whee!

4444
03:29:29.685 --> 03:29:31.353
TRAVIS: And if I'm holding on with one arm,

4445
03:29:31.353 --> 03:29:35.487
I will send three Eldritch Blasts down at that guy.

4446
03:29:35.487 --> 03:29:36.323
MATT: The one that was just next to you?

4447
03:29:36.323 --> 03:29:37.523
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Go for it.

4448
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:40.022
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: That's a cool spell.

4449
03:29:41.225 --> 03:29:43.182
LIAM: How high is it in here, DM?

4450
03:29:43.182 --> 03:29:47.090
MATT: In there in the deck? I'd say it's about, maybe--

4451
03:29:48.010 --> 03:29:49.230
TRAVIS: 19 to hit.

4452
03:29:49.230 --> 03:29:51.028
MATT: --maybe seven feet?
LIAM: Seven. Okay.

4453
03:29:51.028 --> 03:29:52.725
MATT: Yeah, it's not--
LIAM: It's tight.

4454
03:29:52.725 --> 03:29:55.680
MARISHA: Historically, they were, like, five feet.

4455
03:29:55.680 --> 03:29:57.049
MATT: This is a fantasy world.

4456
03:29:57.049 --> 03:29:58.967
(laughter)

4457
03:29:58.967 --> 03:30:00.250
LAURA: I have a question.

4458
03:30:00.250 --> 03:30:02.418
TRAVIS: 19 hit this guy?

4459
03:30:02.418 --> 03:30:03.990
MATT: I'm not being a dick about your blade.

4460
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:06.523
LAURA: No, no, no, I have an actual question about it, then.

4461
03:30:06.523 --> 03:30:08.380
SAM: Historically, there were no fish people.

4462
03:30:08.380 --> 03:30:10.013
MATT: It's true. What was that?

4463
03:30:10.013 --> 03:30:10.846
TRAVIS: 19.

4464
03:30:10.846 --> 03:30:11.679
MATT: 19 hits.

4465
03:30:11.679 --> 03:30:15.700
TRAVIS: That's 11 points of force damage to the first one.

4466
03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:17.691
That's 15 to hit.

4467
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:19.615
MATT: 15 does it.

4468
03:30:19.615 --> 03:30:21.750
TRAVIS: Oh, 15 hits? Okay, that's good.

4469
03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:24.580
That's 14 points of force damage.

4470
03:30:24.580 --> 03:30:25.413
MATT: Nice.

4471
03:30:25.413 --> 03:30:27.680
TRAVIS: And the third one is a natural 20.

4472
03:30:27.680 --> 03:30:29.639
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: All righty.

4473
03:30:31.305 --> 03:30:36.305
TRAVIS: That is 14 doubled, which
is 28 and an extra damage die.

4474
03:30:36.980 --> 03:30:38.770
MATT: Well, you double the dice, not the bonus.
TRAVIS: Oh.

4475
03:30:38.770 --> 03:30:39.603
MATT: So...

4476
03:30:39.603 --> 03:30:42.310
TRAVIS: But don't I have savage something?

4477
03:30:42.310 --> 03:30:45.210
MATT: Savage Attacker means you
can reroll it once if you want to.

4478
03:30:45.210 --> 03:30:48.268
TRAVIS: I thought I had something when I crit. It is...

4479
03:30:49.243 --> 03:30:50.820
when you score a critical hit, you roll one of the dice

4480
03:30:50.820 --> 03:30:52.780
an additional time and add it to the extra damage.

4481
03:30:52.780 --> 03:30:54.657
MATT: Oh sorry, that's--
TRAVIS: Savage attacks.

4482
03:30:54.657 --> 03:30:57.300
MATT: Correct. So what'd you roll for the first die?

4483
03:30:57.300 --> 03:30:58.860
TRAVIS: 28 was--

4484
03:30:58.860 --> 03:31:00.940
so 14 doubled.

4485
03:31:00.940 --> 03:31:03.330
MATT: 14 is what you rolled originally?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

4486
03:31:03.330 --> 03:31:04.520
MATT: Okay, without adding the bonus&gt;

4487
03:31:04.520 --> 03:31:05.353
TRAVIS: Right.

4488
03:31:05.353 --> 03:31:06.340
MATT: Gotcha. Okay, I misunderstood.

4489
03:31:06.340 --> 03:31:09.090
TRAVIS: So, do I double the 14 and then add the 13?

4490
03:31:09.090 --> 03:31:10.490
Or no, just double it.

4491
03:31:10.490 --> 03:31:12.197
MATT: You double it and then
you add the additional die roll.

4492
03:31:12.197 --> 03:31:14.621
TRAVIS: Oh, great, so 28 plus 13

4493
03:31:14.621 --> 03:31:17.946
so 41.

4494
03:31:17.946 --> 03:31:20.220
MATT: Well, Savage Attacker-- okay,
what are you adding the 13 from?

4495
03:31:20.220 --> 03:31:23.140
TRAVIS: Well, I rolled another-- oh,
that's a d20. That's the wrong one.

4496
03:31:23.140 --> 03:31:23.973
MATT: Correct.

4497
03:31:23.973 --> 03:31:27.290
So it would be 28 plus four.

4498
03:31:27.290 --> 03:31:28.702
MATT: Okay!
TRAVIS: Thank you.

4499
03:31:28.702 --> 03:31:30.069
I'm rolling the wrong damn dice.

4500
03:31:30.069 --> 03:31:33.260
MATT: No worries. That's enough. One round of just blasts.

4501
03:31:33.260 --> 03:31:35.880
You end up just icing this creature.

4502
03:31:35.880 --> 03:31:39.110
And you see it now-- (death rattle). It's body leaking

4503
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:43.562
this clear sea foam-like blood from the wounds

4504
03:31:43.562 --> 03:31:45.310
that are left behind.

4505
03:31:45.310 --> 03:31:46.143
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

4506
03:31:46.143 --> 03:31:48.560
MATT: All right, Fjord's turn's over. Yasha, you're up.

4507
03:31:48.560 --> 03:31:49.807
ASHLEY: Okay, so

4508
03:31:50.807 --> 03:31:54.303
I'm going to wake up and walk out of this little area.

4509
03:31:54.303 --> 03:31:55.398
MATT: Okay.

4510
03:31:55.398 --> 03:31:56.416
SAM: (like Yasha) Hello.

4511
03:31:56.416 --> 03:31:58.449
LAURA: (like Yasha) Ooh, there's lots of blades here.

4512
03:31:59.414 --> 03:32:02.918
MATT: 25, 30, 35.

4513
03:32:02.918 --> 03:32:03.760
ASHLEY: Okay.

4514
03:32:03.760 --> 03:32:05.840
MATT: You can see there's now creatures
surrounding you and Nott's right-- or--

4515
03:32:05.840 --> 03:32:08.490
ASHLEY: So these two are in a wall of fire?

4516
03:32:08.490 --> 03:32:10.648
LAURA: Blades.
MATT: Wall of Blades.

4517
03:32:11.497 --> 03:32:14.700
LAURA: It would be very loud because of the cannons.

4518
03:32:14.700 --> 03:32:16.920
MATT: There are sparks everywhere from it hitting the metal.

4519
03:32:16.920 --> 03:32:18.720
SAM: Oh god, sparks! Oh god!

4520
03:32:18.720 --> 03:32:19.850
MATT: Yeah,

4521
03:32:19.850 --> 03:32:21.600
lot of gunpowder in this room.

4522
03:32:21.600 --> 03:32:22.800
SAM: Oh god.
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

4523
03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:25.902
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to walk over to this guy

4524
03:32:25.902 --> 03:32:28.010
right over there to the right.

4525
03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:29.870
See that he's not supposed to be there.

4526
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:31.459
Hey, Veth!

4527
03:32:31.459 --> 03:32:33.276
SAM: Hi, good morning!

4528
03:32:33.276 --> 03:32:34.109
ASHLEY: Take a swing.

4529
03:32:34.109 --> 03:32:35.109
MATT: Go for it.

4530
03:32:37.693 --> 03:32:38.526
Okay.

4531
03:32:40.963 --> 03:32:42.242
Do you want to rage before you do it?

4532
03:32:42.242 --> 03:32:45.283
ASHLEY: Oh yes! Of course. Absolutely, I'm raging.

4533
03:32:47.160 --> 03:32:48.421
23 to hit.

4534
03:32:48.421 --> 03:32:49.587
MATT: That hits.

4535
03:32:49.587 --> 03:32:50.972
ASHLEY: Okay,

4536
03:32:50.972 --> 03:32:51.805
so

4537
03:32:53.078 --> 03:32:55.480
that's-- I'm going to do that again.

4538
03:32:55.480 --> 03:32:59.696
Okay, so seven... That's a little better.

4539
03:33:00.978 --> 03:33:01.811
Eight...

4540
03:33:06.584 --> 03:33:09.279
SAM: And, Caleb just do Fireball in the middle of the--

4541
03:33:09.279 --> 03:33:10.682
LIAM: That'll take care of all of them.

4542
03:33:10.682 --> 03:33:12.690
ASHLEY: 18 for the first hit.

4543
03:33:12.690 --> 03:33:15.730
MATT: 18 points of damage. You got it.

4544
03:33:15.730 --> 03:33:17.239
ASHLEY: Attack again.

4545
03:33:19.020 --> 03:33:21.690
Yeah. 26.

4546
03:33:21.690 --> 03:33:22.523
MATT: 26 hits.

4547
03:33:22.523 --> 03:33:23.631
SAM: How're you doing up there?

4548
03:33:23.631 --> 03:33:25.397
Are you dying? Are you okay?

4549
03:33:25.397 --> 03:33:28.264
TALIESIN: He's having a bad day.
TRAVIS: I'm okay. I'm leaking, but I'm okay.

4550
03:33:28.264 --> 03:33:29.877
SAM: Are you near the-- where are you?

4551
03:33:29.877 --> 03:33:31.270
ASHLEY: 20 points of damage total.

4552
03:33:31.270 --> 03:33:33.940
MATT: 20 points of damage total. All righty. Nice.

4553
03:33:33.940 --> 03:33:35.190
The second hit?

4554
03:33:36.661 --> 03:33:39.940
That wasn't the second hit. 20 points? Or is it 20 total?

4555
03:33:39.940 --> 03:33:41.250
ASHLEY: 20, that was the second hit.

4556
03:33:41.250 --> 03:33:42.485
MATT: Nice.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4557
03:33:42.485 --> 03:33:45.540
MATT: Okay, all right. So as you rush up and hack once

4558
03:33:45.540 --> 03:33:48.550
and a second time into this creature, it looks pretty hurt.

4559
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:49.463
You carve into its body

4560
03:33:49.463 --> 03:33:50.983
and you see how there's the opening inside

4561
03:33:50.983 --> 03:33:54.530
and where its organs are, they're almost translucent.

4562
03:33:54.530 --> 03:33:57.713
Like whatever coloration it would be if you're used

4563
03:33:57.713 --> 03:33:58.622
to seeing the internal organs.

4564
03:33:58.622 --> 03:34:00.502
Everything in there is weirdly see foam

4565
03:34:00.502 --> 03:34:03.997
and see through, like clear. It's awful,

4566
03:34:03.997 --> 03:34:04.830
but it's still standing.

4567
03:34:04.830 --> 03:34:05.663
ASHLEY: Okay.

4568
03:34:05.663 --> 03:34:08.150
And then, as a--

4569
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:09.700
who all is within 60 feet?

4570
03:34:09.700 --> 03:34:11.560
I mean, does that count upwards as well?

4571
03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:12.393
MATT: Yep.

4572
03:34:12.393 --> 03:34:13.990
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: If they can see you.

4573
03:34:13.990 --> 03:34:15.438
ASHLEY: Oh, if they can see me.

4574
03:34:15.438 --> 03:34:17.877
TALIESIN: Only two...

4575
03:34:17.877 --> 03:34:18.710
ASHLEY: I'm going to wait on that.

4576
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:19.543
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4577
03:34:19.543 --> 03:34:20.901
MATT: That finishes your turn.

4578
03:34:20.901 --> 03:34:23.659
All right. Now, it is the sea spawns' turn.

4579
03:34:23.659 --> 03:34:25.702
The three of--
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Sea spawn?

4580
03:34:25.702 --> 03:34:27.232
MATT: These two there.

4581
03:34:28.073 --> 03:34:29.730
So the blade wall.

4582
03:34:29.730 --> 03:34:31.440
What is the damage on that one?

4583
03:34:31.440 --> 03:34:34.940
LAURA: It is 6d10.

4584
03:34:34.940 --> 03:34:36.710
MATT: Roll that damage.

4585
03:34:36.710 --> 03:34:40.030
LAURA: I did, so I wouldn't have to do it. I rolled 32.

4586
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:41.500
MATT: 32, all right.

4587
03:34:41.500 --> 03:34:44.340
That's a failed dex save on one

4588
03:34:44.340 --> 03:34:46.183
and natural one on the other.
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4589
03:34:46.183 --> 03:34:47.016
MATT: So was that--?

4590
03:34:47.016 --> 03:34:47.849
LAURA: 32 points.

4591
03:34:47.849 --> 03:34:48.850
MATT: 36 points.

4592
03:34:48.850 --> 03:34:50.383
SAM: 32.
LAURA: 32 points.

4593
03:34:50.383 --> 03:34:52.041
MATT: 32, sorry.

4594
03:34:52.041 --> 03:34:53.707
Oof.

4595
03:34:53.707 --> 03:34:55.322
That's...

4596
03:34:56.222 --> 03:34:57.730
They're hurting.

4597
03:34:57.730 --> 03:35:00.321
Immediately as their turn starts,
they're like (slicing noises).

4598
03:35:00.321 --> 03:35:03.494
"(screeching)"
TRAVIS: (impacts)

4599
03:35:03.494 --> 03:35:07.689
MATT: Yep, this one's going to
rush out here to get in with Nott.

4600
03:35:09.148 --> 03:35:12.898
This one's going to go ahead and rush over here.

4601
03:35:14.820 --> 03:35:17.999
Actually, no, it's going to stay here against Nott.

4602
03:35:17.999 --> 03:35:21.130
This one's going to stay with Yasha there.

4603
03:35:21.130 --> 03:35:24.162
All right, so the two against Nott are going to strike.

4604
03:35:24.162 --> 03:35:26.803
They have-- oof,

4605
03:35:27.895 --> 03:35:28.728
three attacks. All right.

4606
03:35:28.728 --> 03:35:31.144
So two unarmed strikes and one with a tentacle.

4607
03:35:31.144 --> 03:35:32.915
So since you are prone, they have advantage.
SAM: Sure.

4608
03:35:32.915 --> 03:35:35.135
MATT: Even though you're being flanked there.

4609
03:35:35.135 --> 03:35:37.454
So the first one is going to be a

4610
03:35:37.454 --> 03:35:38.287
20 to hit.

4611
03:35:38.287 --> 03:35:39.337
SAM: Hits!

4612
03:35:39.337 --> 03:35:42.085
MATT: Second one is going to be a 15?

4613
03:35:42.085 --> 03:35:43.951
SAM: Hit! No, miss.

4614
03:35:45.218 --> 03:35:47.927
MATT: All righty. The last one is going to be 22.

4615
03:35:47.927 --> 03:35:48.776
SAM: Hit!

4616
03:35:48.776 --> 03:35:51.572
MATT: All right, so you take

4617
03:35:51.572 --> 03:35:53.146
seven points of bludgeoning damage.

4618
03:35:53.146 --> 03:35:54.046
SAM: Uh-huh.

4619
03:35:54.046 --> 03:35:56.616
MATT: And then from the tentacle

4620
03:35:56.616 --> 03:35:57.449
you take

4621
03:35:57.449 --> 03:36:00.233
nine points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled.

4622
03:36:00.233 --> 03:36:01.066
SAM and LAURA: Ooh.

4623
03:36:01.066 --> 03:36:04.768
MATT: As the tentacle wraps around you
and holds you in place.

4624
03:36:04.768 --> 03:36:07.456
The other one now is going to take its turn.

4625
03:36:07.456 --> 03:36:09.015
And that's going to be at 25 to hit.

4626
03:36:09.015 --> 03:36:09.848
SAM: Hit!

4627
03:36:11.850 --> 03:36:13.092
MATT: 14 to hit.

4628
03:36:13.092 --> 03:36:14.430
SAM: Miss!

4629
03:36:14.430 --> 03:36:16.139
MATT: And-- ooh.

4630
03:36:16.139 --> 03:36:17.130
26 to hit.

4631
03:36:17.130 --> 03:36:18.815
SAM: Hit!

4632
03:36:18.815 --> 03:36:21.160
MATT: So as this one bludgeons you with its unarmed strike,

4633
03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:24.006
you take four points of bludgeoning damage.

4634
03:36:24.006 --> 03:36:26.332
Its other tentacle hits you for

4635
03:36:26.332 --> 03:36:27.485
15 points of bludgeoning damage.

4636
03:36:27.485 --> 03:36:29.110
SAM: I will reduce that one.

4637
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:32.240
MATT: Okay, so you take seven instead.
SAM: Uncanny Dodge.

4638
03:36:32.240 --> 03:36:33.905
MATT: You got it.

4639
03:36:33.905 --> 03:36:35.172
TALIESIN: Roly poly.

4640
03:36:35.172 --> 03:36:37.038
SAM: But I'm grapped.

4641
03:36:37.038 --> 03:36:39.105
MATT: This one here that is charmed by Orly
is just going to go ahead and,

4642
03:36:39.105 --> 03:36:43.812
like, walk over into the space in the middle here

4643
03:36:43.812 --> 03:36:47.137
and just, like, look around, waiting.

4644
03:36:47.137 --> 03:36:49.032
It's not aggressive.

4645
03:36:49.032 --> 03:36:51.752
The one that's next to Marius is going to go ahead

4646
03:36:51.752 --> 03:36:55.153
and turn towards you, Beauregard, since you just rushed up

4647
03:36:55.153 --> 03:36:57.297
and it's going to turn and it's going to attempt to

4648
03:36:57.297 --> 03:36:59.955
fire another poison quill at you.

4649
03:36:59.955 --> 03:37:01.046
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4650
03:37:01.046 --> 03:37:02.362
MATT: As well as two unarmed strikes

4651
03:37:02.362 --> 03:37:04.862
because it can do that altogether now that's on top.

4652
03:37:04.862 --> 03:37:07.277
So the unarmed strikes are going to be--

4653
03:37:07.277 --> 03:37:08.968
oof, a 12.

4654
03:37:08.968 --> 03:37:10.209
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: And a 22.

4655
03:37:10.209 --> 03:37:11.309
MARISHA: Hit.

4656
03:37:11.309 --> 03:37:14.643
MATT: All righty. So you do take

4657
03:37:14.643 --> 03:37:15.800
four points of bludgeoning damage.

4658
03:37:15.800 --> 03:37:16.633
MARISHA: 'kay.

4659
03:37:16.633 --> 03:37:18.699
MATT: Poison quill strike.

4660
03:37:18.699 --> 03:37:20.588
Oh shit, that's going to be 22 to hit.

4661
03:37:20.588 --> 03:37:21.921
MARISHA: Hit.

4662
03:37:21.921 --> 03:37:23.296
MATT: You take

4663
03:37:24.467 --> 03:37:26.116
six points of poison damage, but you're--

4664
03:37:26.116 --> 03:37:27.141
MATT and MARISHA: -- immune to poison.

4665
03:37:27.141 --> 03:37:28.990
MATT: And you don't have to make a saving throw
because you're immune to poison.

4666
03:37:28.990 --> 03:37:31.533
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.
MATT: But it doesn't know that.

4667
03:37:31.533 --> 03:37:32.554
MARISHA: I just fake it a little.

4668
03:37:32.554 --> 03:37:36.546
(exaggerated fake pained noises)

4669
03:37:36.546 --> 03:37:37.787
I'm nauseous!

4670
03:37:37.787 --> 03:37:39.338
MATT: And one that's coming for you, Yasha,

4671
03:37:39.338 --> 03:37:42.120
gets its three attacks on you.

4672
03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:43.470
That's going to be a

4673
03:37:43.470 --> 03:37:44.672
21 to hit.

4674
03:37:44.672 --> 03:37:45.505
ASHLEY: Yep.

4675
03:37:47.300 --> 03:37:49.059
MATT: 15 to hit.

4676
03:37:49.059 --> 03:37:50.367
ASHLEY: No.
LIAM: This asshole right here?

4677
03:37:50.367 --> 03:37:51.974
MATT: And

4678
03:37:51.974 --> 03:37:52.807
17 to hit.

4679
03:37:52.807 --> 03:37:53.832
ASHLEY: Yes, just hits.

4680
03:37:53.832 --> 03:37:54.836
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

4681
03:37:54.836 --> 03:37:57.363
TRAVIS: Yeah, who's that guy?

4682
03:37:57.363 --> 03:37:59.729
MATT: So the first hit deals--

4683
03:37:59.729 --> 03:38:01.338
oh my god!

4684
03:38:01.338 --> 03:38:03.191
Four points of bludgeoning damage.

4685
03:38:03.191 --> 03:38:04.498
ASHLEY: Is that halved?

4686
03:38:04.498 --> 03:38:06.047
MATT: Yes, to two.

4687
03:38:06.047 --> 03:38:07.387
ASHLEY: Okay.

4688
03:38:07.387 --> 03:38:11.422
MATT: And then its tentacle strike is going to be

4689
03:38:11.422 --> 03:38:13.988
13 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to six,

4690
03:38:13.988 --> 03:38:15.657
and you are grappled.

4691
03:38:15.657 --> 03:38:18.732
TRAVIS: What do Yasha's wings look like?

4692
03:38:18.732 --> 03:38:19.690
ASHLEY: I don't think they're--

4693
03:38:19.690 --> 03:38:21.549
MATT: They're not out yet; that was just in the dream.

4694
03:38:21.549 --> 03:38:23.524
SAM: I was imagining, like--

4695
03:38:23.524 --> 03:38:25.474
ASHLEY: I didn't know that was a possibility.
SAM: -- toucan colors.

4696
03:38:25.474 --> 03:38:26.932
ASHLEY: Whatever.

4697
03:38:26.932 --> 03:38:28.740
MATT: But it's an action to use that.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4698
03:38:28.740 --> 03:38:30.202
MARISHA: Macaw wings.

4699
03:38:30.202 --> 03:38:31.803
MATT: All right.

4700
03:38:31.803 --> 03:38:34.203
So finishing their element now.

4701
03:38:34.203 --> 03:38:35.795
It is now Caleb's go,

4702
03:38:35.795 --> 03:38:37.670
with another creature on deck. So yeah, go.

4703
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:38.544
LIAM: Okay, so.

4704
03:38:40.132 --> 03:38:43.378
Storm awake, grab my satchel, and just bust out the door

4705
03:38:43.378 --> 03:38:45.093
because I hear all the noise.

4706
03:38:45.093 --> 03:38:49.650
I can see Jester and this fish man near her?

4707
03:38:49.650 --> 03:38:51.316
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: If I'm in the hallway.

4708
03:38:51.316 --> 03:38:52.557
MATT: Step out into the hallway,

4709
03:38:52.557 --> 03:38:54.468
I would say you can just barely see him.

4710
03:38:54.468 --> 03:38:57.710
LIAM: Yeah, okay, so Caleb jams his hand into his pack,

4711
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:59.900
pulls out a cocoon, starts waving in the air,

4712
03:38:59.900 --> 03:39:02.153
and casts Polymorph at that guy.

4713
03:39:02.153 --> 03:39:03.035
MATT: At him?
LIAM: Yeah.

4714
03:39:03.035 --> 03:39:05.168
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: 17 wisdom.

4715
03:39:05.168 --> 03:39:08.032
LAURA: He's in the middle of a
Blade Barrier, too, just so you know.

4716
03:39:08.032 --> 03:39:11.034
LIAM: Okay. Would I see that?

4717
03:39:11.034 --> 03:39:12.192
MATT: No, you do not.

4718
03:39:12.192 --> 03:39:13.100
LAURA: You wouldn't?
MATT: He wouldn't,

4719
03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:14.349
not from where he's standing.

4720
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:15.524
MATT: All right.
LIAM: What's a blade barrier?

4721
03:39:15.524 --> 03:39:17.097
I don't even know what that is.
MATT: It's a wisdom save?

4722
03:39:17.097 --> 03:39:19.517
TRAVIS: Wall of swords.
LIAM: I don't see swords spinning around?

4723
03:39:19.517 --> 03:39:21.050
MATT: It rolled a 19.
LIAM: Okay.

4724
03:39:21.050 --> 03:39:22.033
MATT: So 16 plus three.

4725
03:39:22.033 --> 03:39:24.925
LIAM: But I wouldn't see swords flying around in air?

4726
03:39:24.925 --> 03:39:27.143
MATT: From this angle, because there's
a wall and a corner there,

4727
03:39:27.143 --> 03:39:29.782
you're probably hearing everything,
but it's just beyond your view.

4728
03:39:29.782 --> 03:39:30.990
TALIESIN: Sounds like a giant battle.

4729
03:39:30.990 --> 03:39:33.231
MATT: There's a whole wall right here and the corner.

4730
03:39:33.231 --> 03:39:35.967
LIAM: Oh. Well, I assumed I saw him because

4731
03:39:35.967 --> 03:39:37.389
you have to see him to cast the spell.
MATT: You can see him,

4732
03:39:37.389 --> 03:39:38.830
but he's just on the outside

4733
03:39:38.830 --> 03:39:41.028
of the blade wall.
LIAM: Okay.

4734
03:39:41.028 --> 03:39:42.169
TRAVIS: Oh nice, I can see that.

4735
03:39:42.169 --> 03:39:46.405
MATT: So you can see him just past that corner, but barely.

4736
03:39:46.405 --> 03:39:48.526
So he resists the spell.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

4737
03:39:48.526 --> 03:39:50.009
MATT: Are you going to stay put?

4738
03:39:50.009 --> 03:39:51.976
LIAM: I thought I used all my movement.

4739
03:39:51.976 --> 03:39:54.398
MATT: You used 15 to get up and then five to move out there.

4740
03:39:54.398 --> 03:39:56.125
LIAM: So I'll move 10 feet forward.

4741
03:39:56.125 --> 03:39:59.077
MATT: Okay. Into the hall a little closer. Got it.

4742
03:39:59.077 --> 03:40:03.152
All right, now it is this guy's turn

4743
03:40:03.152 --> 03:40:05.777
and this guy's turn.

4744
03:40:05.777 --> 03:40:07.102
SAM: (groaning)
LAURA: Okay, so

4745
03:40:07.102 --> 03:40:09.967
here's my question. This is why I was wandering.

4746
03:40:09.967 --> 03:40:10.975
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Because it's

4747
03:40:10.975 --> 03:40:13.213
20 feet high.

4748
03:40:13.213 --> 03:40:15.134
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Does that mean that it would be,

4749
03:40:15.134 --> 03:40:17.711
if the ceilings are only seven feet high,

4750
03:40:17.711 --> 03:40:20.239
would it be sticking out another 13 feet up above,

4751
03:40:20.239 --> 03:40:23.772
or 12 feet above the upper deck?

4752
03:40:23.772 --> 03:40:27.905
MATT: If you want to, you can keep it segmented,

4753
03:40:27.905 --> 03:40:29.243
or you can let it go through,

4754
03:40:29.243 --> 03:40:31.905
in which case, it will destroy the deck above it

4755
03:40:31.905 --> 03:40:32.880
and carve through.

4756
03:40:32.880 --> 03:40:34.651
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Because the blades will have to

4757
03:40:34.651 --> 03:40:36.428
cut through the floor to continue.
LAURA: Okay.

4758
03:40:36.428 --> 03:40:39.034
MATT: But if you want to, just keep it to that deck,

4759
03:40:39.034 --> 03:40:40.948
I'll let you do that
because you are in control of the spell.

4760
03:40:40.948 --> 03:40:42.078
LAURA: Okay.

4761
03:40:42.078 --> 03:40:42.915
I'll do that.

4762
03:40:42.915 --> 03:40:44.250
MATT: Okay.

4763
03:40:44.250 --> 03:40:45.225
LIAM: Gotcha.

4764
03:40:45.225 --> 03:40:46.117
SAM: She'll destroy the ship.

4765
03:40:46.117 --> 03:40:47.327
LAURA: I'm going to destroy the ship.

4766
03:40:47.327 --> 03:40:49.000
TALIESIN: Burn it all!

4767
03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:51.623
MATT: First, that guy. Go ahead and roll damage for him.

4768
03:40:51.623 --> 03:40:54.340
He's going to see if he can make
his dexterity save to escape.

4769
03:40:54.340 --> 03:40:55.698
No! He rolls terrible.

4770
03:40:59.894 --> 03:41:01.454
LIAM: That's what I get for urinating.

4771
03:41:01.454 --> 03:41:03.987
LAURA: 14, 24.

4772
03:41:05.760 --> 03:41:06.893
29.

4773
03:41:08.503 --> 03:41:10.187
MATT: 29, oof!

4774
03:41:10.187 --> 03:41:13.370
29 points of damage to him. All righty.

4775
03:41:14.717 --> 03:41:16.630
He's going to step out of the blade element there

4776
03:41:16.630 --> 03:41:19.122
in the middle and as he steps right in front of you,

4777
03:41:19.122 --> 03:41:21.996
Jester, the little gibbering open jaw

4778
03:41:21.996 --> 03:41:23.988
(tongue fluttering)

4779
03:41:23.988 --> 03:41:24.896
inhales and it--

4780
03:41:24.896 --> 03:41:27.182
LAURA: I don't like it.
MATT: (screeches)

4781
03:41:27.182 --> 03:41:30.590
This screech, this piercing cry

4782
03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:32.560
just echoes throughout,

4783
03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:34.161
through the upper deck.

4784
03:41:34.161 --> 03:41:35.726
Everyone within 300 feet that can hear him,

4785
03:41:35.726 --> 03:41:37.751
which is everyone,

4786
03:41:37.751 --> 03:41:42.534
I need to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

4787
03:41:42.534 --> 03:41:44.250
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

4788
03:41:44.250 --> 03:41:45.450
SAM: Oh boysie.

4789
03:41:46.777 --> 03:41:48.730
MARISHA: Oh, not too cool.
TALIESIN: Yay!

4790
03:41:48.730 --> 03:41:49.563
ASHLEY: Ooh.

4791
03:41:49.563 --> 03:41:51.287
MATT: Fjord?
MARISHA: Not cool.

4792
03:41:51.287 --> 03:41:53.758
TRAVIS: I have [inaudible]. That's good. 19.

4793
03:41:53.758 --> 03:41:55.390
MATT: 19, you're okay.

4794
03:41:55.390 --> 03:41:56.223
MARISHA: Five.

4795
03:41:56.223 --> 03:41:57.769
MATT: Beauregard, you are stunned.

4796
03:41:57.769 --> 03:41:58.617
MARISHA: Stunned?!

4797
03:41:58.617 --> 03:41:59.949
MATT: Yep. Caleb.
LIAM: 16.

4798
03:41:59.949 --> 03:42:01.257
MATT: Caleb, you're fine.

4799
03:42:01.257 --> 03:42:02.430
SAM: 20.

4800
03:42:02.430 --> 03:42:03.855
MATT: You're fine, Veth.

4801
03:42:03.855 --> 03:42:04.688
LAURA: 19.

4802
03:42:04.688 --> 03:42:05.901
MATT: You're fine. Wow, good roll!

4803
03:42:05.901 --> 03:42:06.801
TALIESIN: 25.

4804
03:42:06.801 --> 03:42:07.634
MATT: Fuck, guys!

4805
03:42:07.634 --> 03:42:08.501
ASHLEY: Natural one.

4806
03:42:11.167 --> 03:42:12.356
MATT: Yasha is stunned.

4807
03:42:12.356 --> 03:42:14.165
LIAM: Two heavy hitters.

4808
03:42:14.165 --> 03:42:16.077
Two brawlers are stunned.
MATT: For the rest of the crew.

4809
03:42:16.077 --> 03:42:17.260
MARISHA: I rolled a two.

4810
03:42:19.205 --> 03:42:22.118
MATT: Stunned. Marius.

4811
03:42:22.118 --> 03:42:22.951
LIAM: Bloodbath.

4812
03:42:22.951 --> 03:42:24.857
MATT: Stunned and poisoned.

4813
03:42:24.857 --> 03:42:26.190
LAURA: Oh, Marius.

4814
03:42:27.537 --> 03:42:29.454
MATT: Rest of the crew there.

4815
03:42:31.492 --> 03:42:33.140
Stunned.

4816
03:42:33.140 --> 03:42:34.631
And--
TRAVIS: Oh no!

4817
03:42:35.979 --> 03:42:37.746
MATT: Stunned.
SAM: Well.

4818
03:42:37.746 --> 03:42:38.669
MATT: Okay.

4819
03:42:38.669 --> 03:42:40.927
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool.
MATT: That's his turn.

4820
03:42:42.037 --> 03:42:44.948
The other one that just came up on deck up there,

4821
03:42:44.948 --> 03:42:49.032
it's going to go ahead and move into

4822
03:42:50.400 --> 03:42:51.831
Orly.
LAURA: There's two of them?!

4823
03:42:51.831 --> 03:42:54.047
I should have just sent it through the roof.

4824
03:42:54.047 --> 03:42:56.789
TALIESIN: We'd be sinking.
MATT: You had the option. It's okay.

4825
03:42:56.789 --> 03:42:59.183
It's going to go ahead and make all of its attacks on Orly.

4826
03:42:59.183 --> 03:43:01.775
Orly is currently--

4827
03:43:05.910 --> 03:43:08.248
He is stunned, so it has advantage on the attacks.

4828
03:43:08.248 --> 03:43:10.556
So the first one is going to be--

4829
03:43:12.897 --> 03:43:15.147
Oh, it's really shitty.

4830
03:43:15.147 --> 03:43:17.472
That's a miss.

4831
03:43:18.327 --> 03:43:20.210
LAURA: In his defense, it's really dark outside,

4832
03:43:20.210 --> 03:43:22.802
MATT: Okay, it hits with claw

4833
03:43:22.802 --> 03:43:24.768
and then hits with

4834
03:43:25.973 --> 03:43:28.070
sword. Okay.

4835
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:29.403
Orly takes--

4836
03:43:31.082 --> 03:43:32.845
LIAM: Matt, this is a very cool encounter.

4837
03:43:32.845 --> 03:43:34.525
LAURA: Yes, it is. It's very terrifying.

4838
03:43:34.525 --> 03:43:37.791
It's a lot more than I expected it to be.
MATT: 12 points of damage.

4839
03:43:37.791 --> 03:43:39.335
And six points of damage.

4840
03:43:39.335 --> 03:43:43.398
So Orly's just, like-- Orly's going
(groaning) holding his head.

4841
03:43:43.398 --> 03:43:45.165
At which point, this creature emerges

4842
03:43:45.165 --> 03:43:47.713
over the top of the deck, pulls a blade out

4843
03:43:47.713 --> 03:43:50.082
that also looks very familiar,

4844
03:43:50.082 --> 03:43:53.693
covered in barnacles and having a somewhat

4845
03:43:53.693 --> 03:43:54.834
falchion-like shape to it.

4846
03:43:54.834 --> 03:43:57.250
SAM: Wait, two people have that blade?

4847
03:43:57.250 --> 03:44:00.472
MATT: And goes and claws and then bites into--

4848
03:44:00.472 --> 03:44:02.965
MARISHA: Members Only jackets?

4849
03:44:02.965 --> 03:44:06.881
LAURA: How many people did Uk'otoa--
SAM and TALIESIN: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

4850
03:44:06.881 --> 03:44:08.189
MATT: And that's their turn.

4851
03:44:08.189 --> 03:44:11.002
That brings us to Caduceus and Veth

4852
03:44:11.002 --> 03:44:12.120
TALIESIN: I'll go first.

4853
03:44:12.120 --> 03:44:13.020
SAM: Feel free.

4854
03:44:13.020 --> 03:44:15.128
MATT: If you want to.
Veth has the higher dexterity,

4855
03:44:15.128 --> 03:44:16.763
but you can choose to relinquish

4856
03:44:16.763 --> 03:44:17.955
to Caduceus, if you'd like.

4857
03:44:17.955 --> 03:44:19.213
SAM: It won't matter much.

4858
03:44:19.213 --> 03:44:21.779
I can go first, and just so I can get out

4859
03:44:21.779 --> 03:44:23.896
of the way of whatever you're doing.

4860
03:44:23.896 --> 03:44:26.163
TALIESIN: Nothing super exciting, but we'll see.

4861
03:44:26.163 --> 03:44:26.996
SAM: Me neither.

4862
03:44:26.996 --> 03:44:31.486
I will reach out to the one who is grappling me and be like:

4863
03:44:31.486 --> 03:44:32.764
Get off me, sir.

4864
03:44:32.764 --> 03:44:34.327
And I will--

4865
03:44:34.327 --> 03:44:38.052
I will cast Shocking Grasp.

4866
03:44:38.052 --> 03:44:39.522
MATT: Shocking Grasp on which one?

4867
03:44:39.522 --> 03:44:40.853
SAM: On that one there, yeah.

4868
03:44:40.853 --> 03:44:42.353
MATT: Okay, go for it.

4869
03:44:43.458 --> 03:44:45.148
SAM: 20 to hit.

4870
03:44:45.148 --> 03:44:47.480
MATT: 20 to hit. That definitely hits.

4871
03:44:47.480 --> 03:44:51.730
SAM: 3d8. What's a d8 look like? This one.

4872
03:44:52.781 --> 03:44:54.289
Ooh.

4873
03:44:54.289 --> 03:44:55.846
Seven.

4874
03:44:55.846 --> 03:44:58.279
14 points o' damage.

4875
03:45:01.695 --> 03:45:03.494
MATT: Yeah, that does it.
SAM: Yeah.

4876
03:45:03.494 --> 03:45:06.930
MATT: Between the blade damage that it had
taken, it was already shredded all over

4877
03:45:06.930 --> 03:45:08.888
and then as it came forward
and wrapped you in the tentacle,

4878
03:45:08.888 --> 03:45:11.300
you reached out and grabbed, and
as that pulse of electrical energy

4879
03:45:11.300 --> 03:45:12.933
tore through its body, you watch it (groaning),

4880
03:45:12.933 --> 03:45:16.217
and suddenly its eyes smoke and it (groaning)

4881
03:45:16.217 --> 03:45:18.578
and then falls to the ground destroyed.

4882
03:45:18.578 --> 03:45:20.267
SAM: So I'm no longer grappled?

4883
03:45:20.267 --> 03:45:22.353
MATT: They were both grappling you.
SAM: They both grappled me?

4884
03:45:22.353 --> 03:45:23.678
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Goddamn it!

4885
03:45:23.678 --> 03:45:26.645
MATT: They both wrapped you in tentacles.
LIAM: (laughs)

4886
03:45:28.064 --> 03:45:30.243
SAM: But then I can't do anything else,
right? Because I can't move.

4887
03:45:30.243 --> 03:45:31.949
MATT: You can't move. You got your bonus action.

4888
03:45:31.949 --> 03:45:33.299
SAM: A bonus action.

4889
03:45:36.059 --> 03:45:37.767
I don't really have any bonus actions.

4890
03:45:37.767 --> 03:45:41.657
So I will bonus action cast Mage Hand.

4891
03:45:41.657 --> 03:45:42.890
MATT: All right, there you go.
SAM: Great.

4892
03:45:42.890 --> 03:45:43.898
MATT: There's a Mage Hand.

4893
03:45:43.898 --> 03:45:45.615
Where do you want it to be?

4894
03:45:45.615 --> 03:45:48.425
SAM: Just, like, right in front of the guy's face.

4895
03:45:48.425 --> 03:45:49.733
MATT: All right.

4896
03:45:49.733 --> 03:45:51.715
♪ Waving in his face, ♪
waving in his face. ♪

4897
03:45:51.715 --> 03:45:53.665
TALIESIN: "Hi."
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

4898
03:45:53.665 --> 03:45:56.723
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up, leave the room.

4899
03:45:59.122 --> 03:46:01.297
Oh, wow, okay.

4900
03:46:02.710 --> 03:46:05.888
Excuse me. I'm going to just gently push--

4901
03:46:05.888 --> 03:46:09.745
push by Caleb, getting in front of Caleb as far as I can go.

4902
03:46:09.745 --> 03:46:10.957
MATT: That's about as far as you can get there.

4903
03:46:10.957 --> 03:46:12.207
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: Oh, I'm sorry.

4904
03:46:12.207 --> 03:46:14.425
15-- five, 10. Yeah, that is.

4905
03:46:14.425 --> 03:46:16.258
That's as far as you can get right there.

4906
03:46:16.258 --> 03:46:17.666
TALIESIN: Give you a little cover.

4907
03:46:17.666 --> 03:46:18.499
And...

4908
03:46:20.749 --> 03:46:23.516
Suppose I'm just going to-- Get off our ship!

4909
03:46:23.516 --> 03:46:25.248
Spirit Guardians.

4910
03:46:25.248 --> 03:46:26.395
At 4th-level.

4911
03:46:26.395 --> 03:46:27.290
TRAVIS: Nice.
LAURA: Nice.

4912
03:46:27.290 --> 03:46:28.883
MATT: All righty.

4913
03:46:28.883 --> 03:46:30.232
SAM: Whoa, look at that!

4914
03:46:30.232 --> 03:46:32.188
TALIESIN: That's 15 feet in every direction.

4915
03:46:32.188 --> 03:46:33.821
SAM: I want to see Matt put that on his head

4916
03:46:33.821 --> 03:46:34.804
and wear it like a crown.

4917
03:46:34.804 --> 03:46:38.020
LAURA: Ooh, it would be a really pretty crown.

4918
03:46:38.020 --> 03:46:39.043
MATT: You got it.

4919
03:46:39.043 --> 03:46:40.501
SAM: "You got it"? You'll put it on your head?

4920
03:46:40.501 --> 03:46:41.334
MATT: No.
SAM: Oh.

4921
03:46:42.988 --> 03:46:44.321
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4922
03:46:44.321 --> 03:46:46.146
SAM: Yay!
TRAVIS: Oh, Melora approves!

4923
03:46:46.146 --> 03:46:48.101
Melora approves!

4924
03:46:48.101 --> 03:46:49.933
ASHLEY: Melora!

4925
03:46:49.933 --> 03:46:51.872
MATT: New fun toys.

4926
03:46:51.872 --> 03:46:56.588
TALIESIN: So, yeah. Anybody within it is half speed.

4927
03:46:56.588 --> 03:46:57.998
MATT: Right, half speed, and at the top of their turn--

4928
03:46:57.998 --> 03:46:58.872
TALIESIN: On top on their turn,

4929
03:46:58.872 --> 03:47:00.973
or if they try and enter it,
they take damage.

4930
03:47:00.973 --> 03:47:02.406
MATT: You got it.

4931
03:47:02.406 --> 03:47:04.064
Both of you are concentrating on spells.

4932
03:47:04.064 --> 03:47:05.355
TALIESIN: Makes a wisdom saving throw.

4933
03:47:05.355 --> 03:47:07.563
MATT: You got it. All right, so
that's your action and your movement.

4934
03:47:07.563 --> 03:47:09.303
Anything else, you good?

4935
03:47:09.303 --> 03:47:11.161
TALIESIN: Just double checking.

4936
03:47:11.161 --> 03:47:14.317
And I don't have any bonus actions.

4937
03:47:14.317 --> 03:47:15.744
No, not yet, I'm good.

4938
03:47:15.744 --> 03:47:16.777
MATT: Mmkay.

4939
03:47:19.500 --> 03:47:20.983
MATT: All right, the crew goes.

4940
03:47:20.983 --> 03:47:23.317
Stunned, stunned, stunned.

4941
03:47:23.317 --> 03:47:24.616
Stunned until the end of the creatures' next turn.

4942
03:47:24.616 --> 03:47:26.307
So they're all just stunned.

4943
03:47:26.307 --> 03:47:28.116
Top of the round.

4944
03:47:28.116 --> 03:47:30.223
Jester, you're up.

4945
03:47:30.223 --> 03:47:31.256
LAURA: Okay.

4946
03:47:32.605 --> 03:47:35.023
TALIESIN: There's just multicolored beetles everywhere.

4947
03:47:35.023 --> 03:47:36.692
LAURA: Right, it's beautiful.

4948
03:47:36.692 --> 03:47:39.660
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's some new fancy ones.

4949
03:47:39.660 --> 03:47:44.660
LAURA: For my bonus action, I'm
going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

4950
03:47:44.660 --> 03:47:46.794
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: At 4th-level.

4951
03:47:46.794 --> 03:47:47.877
MATT: At 4th-level.

4952
03:47:47.877 --> 03:47:50.402
LAURA: Right behind the squiddy guy, yeah.

4953
03:47:50.402 --> 03:47:52.069
MATT: Right there?

4954
03:47:52.069 --> 03:47:53.227
LAURA: Okay.

4955
03:47:55.502 --> 03:47:57.490
LAURA: So that's a 19 to hit.

4956
03:47:57.490 --> 03:47:58.565
MATT: 19...

4957
03:47:58.565 --> 03:47:59.398
does hit.

4958
03:47:59.398 --> 03:48:01.206
LAURA: Oh good. Okay.

4959
03:48:06.273 --> 03:48:08.352
(blows raspberry)

4960
03:48:08.352 --> 03:48:09.485
11 points

4961
03:48:10.835 --> 03:48:12.283
of the damage.

4962
03:48:12.283 --> 03:48:13.741
MATT: You got it.
SAM: "Of the damage"?

4963
03:48:13.741 --> 03:48:15.057
MATT: So as it appears and then (thudding)

4964
03:48:15.057 --> 03:48:17.339
hits it from behind. (snarling)

4965
03:48:17.339 --> 03:48:19.460
LAURA: At the same time, I'm going to--

4966
03:48:19.460 --> 03:48:21.918
I'm just assuming-- does he look undead at all

4967
03:48:21.918 --> 03:48:23.368
or does he look just, like--

4968
03:48:23.368 --> 03:48:28.368
MATT: Looks very, like, deep sea alien--

4969
03:48:28.595 --> 03:48:30.495
It doesn't look undead, it looks

4970
03:48:30.495 --> 03:48:32.194
like something you've never seen before

4971
03:48:32.194 --> 03:48:33.887
with a sea-esque motif.

4972
03:48:33.887 --> 03:48:35.745
LAURA: Then at the same time, I'm going to

4973
03:48:35.745 --> 03:48:39.377
reach my hand forward and cast Toll the Dead.

4974
03:48:39.377 --> 03:48:41.952
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Ring that fucking bell.

4975
03:48:41.952 --> 03:48:44.145
LAURA: Giant bell over top of his head.

4976
03:48:44.145 --> 03:48:46.792
MATT: (ringing) Was that a dex save? Constitution?

4977
03:48:46.792 --> 03:48:47.852
LAURA: That is a...

4978
03:48:47.852 --> 03:48:50.376
wisdom save.
MATT: Wisdom save.

4979
03:48:50.376 --> 03:48:51.376
Natural 20.

4980
03:48:52.802 --> 03:48:53.935
LAURA: Okay.

4981
03:48:53.935 --> 03:48:54.928
TALIESIN: Still take half, or nothing?

4982
03:48:54.928 --> 03:48:56.878
MATT: No, not for the cantrip.
LAURA: No, I don't think I can do anything.

4983
03:48:56.878 --> 03:48:58.498
MATT: Okay, so that finish your turn, Jester?

4984
03:48:58.498 --> 03:49:00.520
LAURA: Apparently.
MATT: All right. Beau, you're up.

4985
03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:01.528
MARISHA: Stunned?
MATT: Yep.

4986
03:49:01.528 --> 03:49:03.570
LAURA: I can't run by him, no?

4987
03:49:03.570 --> 03:49:05.650
MATT: No, not past him, there's not enough room.

4988
03:49:05.650 --> 03:49:07.805
LAURA: Okay, yeah.
MATT: You're right there.

4989
03:49:07.805 --> 03:49:09.388
All right, so, you're stunned.

4990
03:49:11.296 --> 03:49:12.979
This guy over here.
TALIESIN: Fuck pants.

4991
03:49:12.979 --> 03:49:14.785
MATT: Is going to step over here.
TALIESIN: Don't like any of this.

4992
03:49:14.785 --> 03:49:17.162
SAM: Who are these fuckers?

4993
03:49:17.162 --> 03:49:18.186
So what are the--

4994
03:49:18.186 --> 03:49:21.087
Where are the ones with the falchions?

4995
03:49:21.087 --> 03:49:22.185
TRAVIS: One,

4996
03:49:22.185 --> 03:49:23.418
two.

4997
03:49:23.418 --> 03:49:26.272
I don't know if that dude down the bottom
with the spider legs has one or not.

4998
03:49:26.272 --> 03:49:27.907
SAM: And which one was the one who first attacked you?

4999
03:49:27.907 --> 03:49:30.940
The guy up there.
TRAVIS: This motherfucker right here.

5000
03:49:30.940 --> 03:49:32.595
He's got Armor of Agathys up.
SAM: How many fucking people

5001
03:49:32.595 --> 03:49:34.871
have falchions in this world?

5002
03:49:34.871 --> 03:49:36.640
TRAVIS: I don't know, I thought
it was a pretty unique sword.

5003
03:49:36.640 --> 03:49:38.020
SAM: There was a sale on falchions.

5004
03:49:38.020 --> 03:49:41.205
MATT: He's going to step off to the side here

5005
03:49:41.205 --> 03:49:43.245
and do three Eldritch Blasts against you, Fjord.

5006
03:49:43.245 --> 03:49:45.740
TRAVIS: Not even weighted that well-- okay.

5007
03:49:45.740 --> 03:49:46.723
LAURA: Shit. I should've--

5008
03:49:46.723 --> 03:49:48.289
MATT: That is a...

5009
03:49:48.289 --> 03:49:49.912
16.

5010
03:49:49.912 --> 03:49:52.297
TRAVIS: That hits.
MATT: Natural 20.

5011
03:49:52.297 --> 03:49:54.379
TRAVIS: That's three natural 20s.

5012
03:49:54.379 --> 03:49:55.796
SAM: Don't worry, Caduceus can cancel it.

5013
03:49:55.796 --> 03:49:56.935
MATT: And an 11.
TALIESIN: No, I can't.

5014
03:49:56.935 --> 03:49:58.431
SAM: Goddamn you, man.
TALIESIN: I'm not up there.

5015
03:49:58.431 --> 03:50:00.722
MATT: All right. All three hit.

5016
03:50:00.722 --> 03:50:02.913
You take four points of force damage.

5017
03:50:02.913 --> 03:50:03.854
TRAVIS: Okay.

5018
03:50:03.854 --> 03:50:06.827
MATT: 16 points of force damage from the crit.

5019
03:50:06.827 --> 03:50:09.528
And nine points of force damage from all three.
TALIESIN: 29 points of damage?

5020
03:50:09.528 --> 03:50:11.989
TRAVIS: Wow, you do that really fast.

5021
03:50:11.989 --> 03:50:13.524
Wow.

5022
03:50:13.524 --> 03:50:14.932
Wow, wow.

5023
03:50:14.932 --> 03:50:17.149
Okay, cool.
SAM: Burial at sea.

5024
03:50:17.149 --> 03:50:19.921
LAURA: Fjord, if you go down
while you're hanging from something

5025
03:50:19.921 --> 03:50:21.688
you'll take a damage--

5026
03:50:21.688 --> 03:50:24.821
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

5027
03:50:24.821 --> 03:50:29.294
MATT: And then is going to
use the rest of the movement to--

5028
03:50:29.294 --> 03:50:30.937
MARISHA: Go back.

5029
03:50:30.937 --> 03:50:33.091
Piece of shit.
MATT: There.

5030
03:50:33.091 --> 03:50:34.155
MARISHA: Ugh.

5031
03:50:34.155 --> 03:50:36.017
MATT: It's going to hold back in that space.

5032
03:50:36.017 --> 03:50:37.375
TRAVIS: Do you have a distance ruler back there,

5033
03:50:37.375 --> 03:50:39.116
like, a little plastic flimsy thing?

5034
03:50:39.116 --> 03:50:42.234
MATT: That's it right there, actually. Using it for that.

5035
03:50:42.234 --> 03:50:44.127
SAM: Where are you, Marish?

5036
03:50:44.127 --> 03:50:45.882
MATT: I can trade it out for
something, if you wanted to use it.

5037
03:50:45.882 --> 03:50:47.827
MARISHA: I'm stunned by Marius.

5038
03:50:47.827 --> 03:50:50.030
SAM: Shit, you're stunned?
MARISHA: Yeah.

5039
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:52.112
SAM: A stunned monk is like, nothing.

5040
03:50:52.112 --> 03:50:54.143
MATT: Fjord, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

5041
03:50:54.143 --> 03:50:55.412
TRAVIS: Okay.

5042
03:50:55.412 --> 03:50:57.052
I'm going to try something.

5043
03:50:58.418 --> 03:51:01.943
So the di-- the distance-- I'm trying to...

5044
03:51:05.700 --> 03:51:08.092
Yeah. I'm going to

5045
03:51:08.092 --> 03:51:09.004
shimmy--

5046
03:51:09.004 --> 03:51:11.653
MATT: I need you to make three
constitution saving throws, by the way.

5047
03:51:11.653 --> 03:51:14.112
SAM: Oof.
LIAM: Holy shit.

5048
03:51:14.112 --> 03:51:16.880
TRAVIS: Oh, to maintain Far Step?
MATT: To maintain Far Step, yes.

5049
03:51:16.880 --> 03:51:18.737
TRAVIS: Okay, I have War Caster.

5050
03:51:18.737 --> 03:51:21.232
MATT: Correct, so the first one?

5051
03:51:21.232 --> 03:51:23.890
TRAVIS: Is a-- What is it, a con?
MATT: Yes.

5052
03:51:23.890 --> 03:51:24.966
TRAVIS: Saving throw?
MATT: Yes.

5053
03:51:24.966 --> 03:51:26.099
TRAVIS: 21.
MATT: You're fine.

5054
03:51:26.099 --> 03:51:28.437
Second one.
This one's going to be higher.

5055
03:51:28.437 --> 03:51:29.625
TRAVIS: Is a 23.

5056
03:51:29.625 --> 03:51:31.609
MATT: You're fine. Third one.

5057
03:51:33.022 --> 03:51:34.022
TRAVIS: 20.
MATT: You're fine.

5058
03:51:34.022 --> 03:51:34.997
All right, Far Step maintains.

5059
03:51:34.997 --> 03:51:37.754
TALIESIN: War Caster for the win!
MARISHA: War Caster's the best.

5060
03:51:37.754 --> 03:51:40.970
TRAVIS: I would like to shimmy around this side of the mast

5061
03:51:40.970 --> 03:51:45.970
and I'm going to release and fall about five to 10 feet

5062
03:51:46.262 --> 03:51:48.512
and I am going to cast

5063
03:51:48.512 --> 03:51:50.715
Hexblade's Curse at the gentleman

5064
03:51:50.715 --> 03:51:53.157
that's wielding the falchion below me.

5065
03:51:53.157 --> 03:51:55.412
Just about five feet after I fall.

5066
03:51:55.412 --> 03:51:56.561
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's awesome.

5067
03:51:56.561 --> 03:51:57.477
TRAVIS: And then I'm going to use--

5068
03:51:57.477 --> 03:51:59.243
MATT: In the air, just (whooshing) curse it.

5069
03:51:59.243 --> 03:52:02.204
TRAVIS: Then I'm going to
Far Step back up to the crow's nest.

5070
03:52:02.204 --> 03:52:04.928
MATT: All right. (whooshing) Up on top.

5071
03:52:04.928 --> 03:52:06.827
That's rad.
MARISHA: That was so cool!

5072
03:52:06.827 --> 03:52:08.745
MATT: You fall, and as you concentrate outward,

5073
03:52:08.745 --> 03:52:11.697
your sword behind you like that, from the ground beneath,

5074
03:52:11.697 --> 03:52:16.383
you watch as, from the wood, green vines suddenly emerge

5075
03:52:16.383 --> 03:52:18.997
from the long dead wood and wrap around the legs

5076
03:52:18.997 --> 03:52:21.168
and then begin to dig up into its various limbs

5077
03:52:21.168 --> 03:52:23.567
and hold it in place as the Hexblade's Curse,

5078
03:52:23.567 --> 03:52:26.699
now through the Wild Mother's
vision, takes hold.

5079
03:52:26.699 --> 03:52:28.924
And as you're about to land, you (whooshing)

5080
03:52:28.924 --> 03:52:31.224
and then appear up top and catch yourself

5081
03:52:31.224 --> 03:52:34.872
just, you know, shirtless, bloody,
holding the blade in one hand on the top

5082
03:52:34.872 --> 03:52:36.740
the rain just bearing down on you.

5083
03:52:36.740 --> 03:52:39.053
(breaths heavily)
MARISHA: Ooh! Ooh!

5084
03:52:39.053 --> 03:52:41.182
TRAVIS: How much movement would you say I have left?

5085
03:52:41.182 --> 03:52:43.322
MARISHA: He's all glisten-y in the moonlight.

5086
03:52:43.322 --> 03:52:45.163
MATT: You--

5087
03:52:45.163 --> 03:52:46.582
you moved around the mast before falling.

5088
03:52:46.582 --> 03:52:49.320
I'd say, and to go with the climbing,
I'd say you have 15 more feet.

5089
03:52:49.320 --> 03:52:51.283
TRAVIS: Okay, great. I'm going to lean over the railing

5090
03:52:51.283 --> 03:52:53.510
and I'm going to send two Eldritch Blasts

5091
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:55.533
down at the one that I just cursed.

5092
03:52:55.533 --> 03:52:56.366
MATT: You got it.

5093
03:52:58.742 --> 03:53:01.959
LIAM: That was awesome, Travis.
MARISHA: Yeah, that was so cool!

5094
03:53:01.959 --> 03:53:04.764
LIAM: That's why we love this game.
TRAVIS: 16 on the first one.

5095
03:53:04.764 --> 03:53:05.989
MATT: 16.
TRAVIS: Does that miss?

5096
03:53:05.989 --> 03:53:07.030
MATT: That hits.
TRAVIS: It does hit.

5097
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:08.147
Okay, great. I'm going to--

5098
03:53:08.147 --> 03:53:09.547
LAURA: Are you sure it's not for the

5099
03:53:09.547 --> 03:53:13.529
collision of sparks and beetles happening below deck?

5100
03:53:13.529 --> 03:53:16.387
TRAVIS: Eight points of force damage.
MATT: Eight points of force damage.

5101
03:53:16.387 --> 03:53:19.370
TRAVIS: And the second one is a 23.

5102
03:53:19.370 --> 03:53:21.128
Plus four. Damn it.

5103
03:53:21.128 --> 03:53:23.240
Only eight points of force damage again.

5104
03:53:23.240 --> 03:53:26.248
The third one, I'm going to send at this motherfucker

5105
03:53:26.248 --> 03:53:29.023
and say: I know that spell.

5106
03:53:29.023 --> 03:53:30.874
And that is a 20 to hit.

5107
03:53:30.874 --> 03:53:32.250
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5108
03:53:32.250 --> 03:53:33.233
TRAVIS: And

5109
03:53:33.233 --> 03:53:36.307
that 15 points of force damage.

5110
03:53:36.307 --> 03:53:37.157
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Add an

5111
03:53:37.157 --> 03:53:40.967
additional eight points, two fours, to this guy

5112
03:53:40.967 --> 03:53:43.935
because of the Hexblade's Curse,
there's a plus four to damage.

5113
03:53:43.935 --> 03:53:45.527
MATT: An additional eight, you said?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

5114
03:53:45.527 --> 03:53:47.677
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: So I'll send the two and the one

5115
03:53:47.677 --> 03:53:49.515
and then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to just

5116
03:53:49.515 --> 03:53:53.577
lay down on the crow's nest.

5117
03:53:53.577 --> 03:53:56.569
(panting) Just fully prone.

5118
03:53:56.569 --> 03:53:57.402
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: Okay.

5119
03:53:57.402 --> 03:54:00.672
TALIESIN: I have technically made a
pillow fort up there, just saying.

5120
03:54:00.672 --> 03:54:02.222
It's got a little more cover.
MATT: Fair enough.

5121
03:54:02.222 --> 03:54:03.530
TRAVIS: It's very comfortable.
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

5122
03:54:03.530 --> 03:54:04.724
ASHLEY: Okay.

5123
03:54:04.724 --> 03:54:06.920
MATT: Well, you're stunned.

5124
03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:08.306
Sorry, I just realized.
ASHLEY: Okay! Yeah.

5125
03:54:08.306 --> 03:54:09.373
MATT: Sorry.
ASHLEY: It's okay.

5126
03:54:09.373 --> 03:54:10.255
MATT: Okay.

5127
03:54:10.255 --> 03:54:11.622
So that's your turn.

5128
03:54:11.622 --> 03:54:16.058
Now the stuns-- no, the stuns don't wear off yet.

5129
03:54:16.058 --> 03:54:18.458
It is now the sea spawns' turn.

5130
03:54:18.458 --> 03:54:19.576
MARISHA: Snea Snawn.

5131
03:54:19.576 --> 03:54:21.401
ASHLEY and SAM: Snea Snawn.

5132
03:54:21.401 --> 03:54:24.340
MATT: The one that's up against you, Yasha, because you are

5133
03:54:24.340 --> 03:54:27.023
stunned, it has advantage on its strikes against you.

5134
03:54:27.023 --> 03:54:29.440
So for that one it's going to be

5135
03:54:32.855 --> 03:54:34.747
19 to hit.
ASHLEY: That hits.

5136
03:54:34.747 --> 03:54:36.755
LAURA: Is she still raging in her stunned-ness?

5137
03:54:36.755 --> 03:54:38.471
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Okay, good.

5138
03:54:38.471 --> 03:54:39.871
MATT: And

5139
03:54:39.871 --> 03:54:41.196
double ones.

5140
03:54:41.196 --> 03:54:42.579
ALL: Yeah!

5141
03:54:42.579 --> 03:54:44.488
MATT: That's a rare sight.

5142
03:54:44.488 --> 03:54:47.071
I feel like he pisses himself just because of that point.

5143
03:54:47.071 --> 03:54:50.660
TRAVIS: That's the balance with the natural 20s.

5144
03:54:50.660 --> 03:54:52.277
MATT: Yeah.

5145
03:54:52.277 --> 03:54:54.194
All right, so you take

5146
03:54:55.077 --> 03:54:56.847
10 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to five.

5147
03:54:56.847 --> 03:54:58.245
ASHLEY: Okay.

5148
03:54:58.245 --> 03:55:00.267
MATT: And from the

5149
03:55:00.267 --> 03:55:03.725
tentacle, it's now squeezing you within its grasp.

5150
03:55:04.725 --> 03:55:06.949
Ooh, that is

5151
03:55:06.949 --> 03:55:09.276
12 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to six.

5152
03:55:09.276 --> 03:55:10.200
ASHLEY: Okay.

5153
03:55:10.200 --> 03:55:11.408
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Beast.

5154
03:55:12.726 --> 03:55:14.209
MATT: This one here that's still grappling Nott

5155
03:55:14.209 --> 03:55:17.116
is just going to go ahead and attack you twice.

5156
03:55:17.116 --> 03:55:18.677
You are still prone because you haven't

5157
03:55:18.677 --> 03:55:20.845
had any movement to get up, so it has advantage

5158
03:55:20.845 --> 03:55:22.070
on its attacks against you.

5159
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:24.145
That is a 23.

5160
03:55:24.145 --> 03:55:25.347
SAM: Hit.

5161
03:55:25.347 --> 03:55:26.701
MATT: 25.

5162
03:55:26.701 --> 03:55:27.534
SAM: Hit.

5163
03:55:27.534 --> 03:55:28.725
MATT: And a natural 20.

5164
03:55:28.725 --> 03:55:30.005
TALIESIN: Cancel!

5165
03:55:30.005 --> 03:55:31.582
LAURA: Ah!

5166
03:55:31.582 --> 03:55:33.590
TRAVIS: Grave cleric.
SAM: Oh.

5167
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:35.117
MATT: Do you have to see the person who's attacking

5168
03:55:35.117 --> 03:55:36.599
or you have to see the person who's being hit?

5169
03:55:36.599 --> 03:55:38.122
TALIESIN: That's a good question. Let me find out.

5170
03:55:38.122 --> 03:55:40.780
MATT: Because you cannot see Nott right now.

5171
03:55:40.780 --> 03:55:43.593
TALIESIN: Let me see. (pondering noises)

5172
03:55:43.593 --> 03:55:45.676
LIAM: There is no Nott, only Veth.

5173
03:55:50.319 --> 03:55:52.892
MATT: Veth. Getting used to it. My bad.

5174
03:55:52.892 --> 03:55:54.870
TALIESIN: "The creature." Fuck. So no.

5175
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:56.192
"The creature who suffers the hit."

5176
03:55:56.192 --> 03:55:58.980
MATT: Yeah, so you cannot see Veth.
LAURA: No!

5177
03:55:58.980 --> 03:56:01.180
MATT: All right.
SAM: I will Uncanny Dodge that last one.

5178
03:56:01.180 --> 03:56:04.743
Oh wait, can I? I'm grappled; I can't Uncanny Dodge.

5179
03:56:04.743 --> 03:56:07.173
MATT: Well, no, it's a reaction,
you still have your reaction.

5180
03:56:07.173 --> 03:56:09.103
But if you-- you haven't Uncanny Dodged since last time.

5181
03:56:09.103 --> 03:56:10.377
So yeah. So you can.

5182
03:56:10.377 --> 03:56:11.942
TALIESIN: I have no reaction, either.

5183
03:56:11.942 --> 03:56:12.775
MATT: No worries.

5184
03:56:12.775 --> 03:56:14.225
LIAM: You used your reaction?
TALIESIN: No, I didn't.

5185
03:56:14.225 --> 03:56:15.058
LIAM: Did not.

5186
03:56:15.058 --> 03:56:18.616
TALIESIN: There's nothing to fire at.
MATT: You, Veth, take

5187
03:56:18.616 --> 03:56:21.324
nine points of bludgeoning damage from an unarmed strike.

5188
03:56:21.324 --> 03:56:22.157
SAM: Boop.

5189
03:56:22.157 --> 03:56:24.577
MATT: Eight points of bludgeoning damage
from another unarmed strike.

5190
03:56:24.577 --> 03:56:26.757
SAM: Boop.
MATT: And the tentacle.

5191
03:56:26.757 --> 03:56:28.882
Oh,

5192
03:56:28.882 --> 03:56:31.000
25 points of bludgeoning damage.

5193
03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:31.833
SAM: Uncanny Dodge.

5194
03:56:31.833 --> 03:56:34.202
MATT: Reduced to half, so that brings you to 12.

5195
03:56:34.202 --> 03:56:35.357
TRAVIS: Where you at?

5196
03:56:35.357 --> 03:56:36.390
SAM: I'm fine.

5197
03:56:36.390 --> 03:56:38.082
TRAVIS: Yep, me too.

5198
03:56:39.042 --> 03:56:39.958
MATT: All right.

5199
03:56:39.958 --> 03:56:41.945
TRAVIS: ♪ On a cloudy day. ♪
LAURA: Oh my god.

5200
03:56:41.945 --> 03:56:45.260
MATT: This one here is-- takes how much damage?

5201
03:56:45.260 --> 03:56:47.567
LAURA: Oh, did he just come up in?

5202
03:56:47.567 --> 03:56:48.408
MATT: He would have--

5203
03:56:48.408 --> 03:56:49.243
LAURA: I should roll.

5204
03:56:49.243 --> 03:56:50.797
TRAVIS: ♪ Come up, come up, come up here ♪

5205
03:56:50.797 --> 03:56:54.071
MATT: Actually, he would have left it last round.

5206
03:56:54.071 --> 03:56:55.959
I forgot to pull him out of there.

5207
03:56:55.959 --> 03:56:58.172
But I'll let it happen, we'll say he just--

5208
03:56:58.172 --> 03:57:00.492
That's fine; that's my fault.
TALIESIN: Confused. A lot's happening there.

5209
03:57:00.492 --> 03:57:02.250
LAURA: 14.

5210
03:57:02.250 --> 03:57:06.275
22, 23, 26,

5211
03:57:07.166 --> 03:57:08.016
28.

5212
03:57:08.016 --> 03:57:10.847
Gets lower every time. 28 points.

5213
03:57:10.847 --> 03:57:13.305
MATT: 28. Let's see if he makes his save.

5214
03:57:14.980 --> 03:57:17.405
Yep, that's an 18, so it takes half that, so it's a nine.

5215
03:57:17.405 --> 03:57:18.860
So it's still up.

5216
03:57:18.860 --> 03:57:21.517
LAURA: 29 points is-- no, 28.

5217
03:57:21.517 --> 03:57:23.801
MATT: It takes nine-- sorry. You said 28.

5218
03:57:23.801 --> 03:57:24.938
LAURA: Divided by two.

5219
03:57:24.938 --> 03:57:27.161
MATT: Right, sorry, so that's--
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: 14.

5220
03:57:27.161 --> 03:57:29.320
MATT: 14, not bad. Still up, though.

5221
03:57:30.447 --> 03:57:31.280
Barely.

5222
03:57:32.916 --> 03:57:36.157
It's going to go ahead and pull out of the blades.

5223
03:57:36.157 --> 03:57:37.550
There's no way for it to get over there.

5224
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:39.516
TALIESIN: I mean, it can certainly try.

5225
03:57:39.516 --> 03:57:41.507
MATT: Move past Nott there

5226
03:57:41.507 --> 03:57:43.050
and it's actually going to go-- it's looking that you're

5227
03:57:43.050 --> 03:57:44.325
wrapped up and being crushed.

5228
03:57:44.325 --> 03:57:45.795
You're the one who's currently stunned, Yasha,

5229
03:57:45.795 --> 03:57:47.569
so it's going to go after you.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5230
03:57:47.569 --> 03:57:49.615
MATT: So it's going to go ahead and make two unarmed strikes

5231
03:57:49.615 --> 03:57:51.181
and then one with its poison quills.

5232
03:57:51.181 --> 03:57:53.330
Since you are stunned, it has advantage.

5233
03:57:53.330 --> 03:57:55.596
That is a

5234
03:57:55.596 --> 03:57:56.747
17 to hit.

5235
03:57:56.747 --> 03:57:57.580
ASHLEY: Just hits.

5236
03:57:59.890 --> 03:58:01.992
MATT: Ooh, 22 to hit.
ASHLEY: Yep.

5237
03:58:01.992 --> 03:58:02.825
MATT: And

5238
03:58:03.731 --> 03:58:04.930
19 to hit.
ASHLEY: Yep.

5239
03:58:04.930 --> 03:58:05.763
MATT: All right.

5240
03:58:05.763 --> 03:58:06.771
TALIESIN: Tank. Fucking tank.

5241
03:58:06.771 --> 03:58:09.804
MATT: You take seven points of
bludgeoning damage, reduced to three.

5242
03:58:09.804 --> 03:58:11.521
ASHLEY: Okay.

5243
03:58:11.521 --> 03:58:12.960
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to two.

5244
03:58:12.960 --> 03:58:14.615
ASHLEY: Okay.

5245
03:58:14.615 --> 03:58:17.743
MATT: And eight points of poison damage that is not reduced,

5246
03:58:17.743 --> 03:58:19.735
and I need you to make constitution saving throw.

5247
03:58:21.307 --> 03:58:22.140
ASHLEY: Okay.

5248
03:58:27.947 --> 03:58:29.014
18.

5249
03:58:29.014 --> 03:58:32.380
MATT: All right, you are not poisoned.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5250
03:58:32.380 --> 03:58:34.067
(exhales)
TALIESIN: Good con, good con.

5251
03:58:34.067 --> 03:58:35.651
MATT: Okay.

5252
03:58:35.651 --> 03:58:37.490
That brings us to Caleb.

5253
03:58:37.490 --> 03:58:39.686
LIAM: I'm hoping to use my reaction to shout.

5254
03:58:39.686 --> 03:58:40.653
MATT: Actually, hold on. This guy,

5255
03:58:40.653 --> 03:58:43.110
I forgot about this guy here has to go. My apologies.

5256
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:44.458
LIAM: Bluest of balls.

5257
03:58:44.458 --> 03:58:46.033
I would like to use my reaction to shout:

5258
03:58:46.033 --> 03:58:48.983
Caduceus, Jester, duck! Get down!

5259
03:58:48.983 --> 03:58:49.983
MATT: All right.

5260
03:58:51.295 --> 03:58:53.142
Oh, and there's the guy-- the guy next to you, Yasha,

5261
03:58:53.142 --> 03:58:54.520
hasn't attacked you yet, did he?

5262
03:58:54.520 --> 03:58:56.145
ASHLEY: No.
MATT: Right, so.

5263
03:58:56.145 --> 03:58:57.970
ASHLEY: What you just did, it was-- yeah.

5264
03:58:57.970 --> 03:58:58.803
MATT: The other guy.

5265
03:58:58.803 --> 03:59:01.312
So the guy below is going to go ahead and go after you.

5266
03:59:01.312 --> 03:59:02.970
That is going to be a 20 to hit.

5267
03:59:02.970 --> 03:59:03.803
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5268
03:59:05.808 --> 03:59:07.867
MATT: 18 to hit.
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

5269
03:59:07.867 --> 03:59:08.700
MATT: And

5270
03:59:11.998 --> 03:59:13.598
16 hit.
ASHLEY: No.

5271
03:59:13.598 --> 03:59:16.398
MATT: That misses, all righty. So you take

5272
03:59:17.443 --> 03:59:18.963
six points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to three.

5273
03:59:18.963 --> 03:59:20.646
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: And

5274
03:59:20.646 --> 03:59:22.359
six points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to three.

5275
03:59:22.359 --> 03:59:24.159
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Fucking rage.

5276
03:59:24.159 --> 03:59:27.718
All right. The guy up here has a stunned Marius

5277
03:59:27.718 --> 03:59:30.090
and stunned Beauregard. It's going to split its attacks

5278
03:59:30.090 --> 03:59:31.244
between the two of you.

5279
03:59:31.244 --> 03:59:32.077
MARISHA: Okay.

5280
03:59:33.362 --> 03:59:37.424
MATT: So it's going to attack
you first, Beauregard, with advantage.

5281
03:59:37.424 --> 03:59:38.752
That's going to be a 20 to hit.

5282
03:59:38.752 --> 03:59:40.343
MARISHA: Yep. Just hits.

5283
03:59:40.343 --> 03:59:41.468
MATT: Attacking Marius.

5284
03:59:42.953 --> 03:59:44.536
That's an 18, that hits.

5285
03:59:44.536 --> 03:59:47.128
Then back to you, Beauregard, with its quill.

5286
03:59:47.128 --> 03:59:49.472
And that is going to be,

5287
03:59:49.472 --> 03:59:52.255
that's a 23 to hit, but you're immune to poison

5288
03:59:52.255 --> 03:59:54.640
so it doesn't do anything, but it's unaware of that.

5289
03:59:54.640 --> 03:59:57.248
So you, Beauregard, you take--
MARISHA: Ouch, you did it again!

5290
03:59:57.248 --> 03:59:59.698
MATT: 11 points bludgeoning damage.
MARISHA: Okay.

5291
03:59:59.698 --> 04:00:01.890
MATT: Marius takes five points of bludgeoning damage.

5292
04:00:01.890 --> 04:00:04.032
TALIESIN: Fuck my life.
MATT: Marius is starting to look kind of hurt.

5293
04:00:04.032 --> 04:00:07.654
TALIESIN: We are not even out of the bottom of the ship yet.

5294
04:00:07.654 --> 04:00:09.815
MARISHA: We started--
MATT: Yep.

5295
04:00:09.815 --> 04:00:10.943
All right, finishing up

5296
04:00:10.943 --> 04:00:12.590
with their turn, now it is your turn, Caleb.

5297
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:15.067
LIAM: So I just used a reaction to yell to Caduceus

5298
04:00:15.067 --> 04:00:17.650
and Jester to duck,

5299
04:00:17.650 --> 04:00:18.500
so it's up to them--

5300
04:00:18.500 --> 04:00:22.390
TALIESIN: I will use my reaction
to crouch or at least pull

5301
04:00:22.390 --> 04:00:24.343
against the wall, get out
of the way if you're going to

5302
04:00:24.343 --> 04:00:26.415
shoot something by me.

5303
04:00:26.415 --> 04:00:28.252
MATT: Unfortunately, it's not your turn yet, so no.

5304
04:00:28.252 --> 04:00:30.752
LIAM: Not as a reaction, they can't--?

5305
04:00:30.752 --> 04:00:33.901
MATT: Part of the strategy here is you have to--

5306
04:00:33.901 --> 04:00:35.878
if they're going to move out of the way,
they have to do that on their turn.

5307
04:00:35.878 --> 04:00:38.945
LIAM: Okay, they don't, so I will
not do the spell I was going to do.

5308
04:00:38.945 --> 04:00:41.313
I will cast Polymorph again. 17.

5309
04:00:41.313 --> 04:00:43.380
TRAVIS: Nice. Let's go.
MATT: Okay, on the same guy there.

5310
04:00:44.708 --> 04:00:46.208
That is going to be a...

5311
04:00:48.532 --> 04:00:49.865
TALIESIN: About to take-- nah--

5312
04:00:51.257 --> 04:00:52.160
MATT: 16.

5313
04:00:52.160 --> 04:00:53.455
SAM: Hey!
LAURA: Hey!

5314
04:00:53.455 --> 04:00:54.799
MATT: 17 right, is your DC?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5315
04:00:54.799 --> 04:00:56.174
MATT: So yeah, no, that works.
What are you polymorphing him as?

5316
04:00:56.174 --> 04:00:57.383
LIAM: A mackerel.

5317
04:00:57.383 --> 04:00:58.613
MATT: (laughs)

5318
04:00:58.613 --> 04:00:59.775
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

5319
04:00:59.775 --> 04:01:02.334
TRAVIS: What is a mackerel? A bird?
LIAM: It's a big, fat fish.

5320
04:01:02.334 --> 04:01:04.028
TRAVIS: Oh!
MATT: Big, fat fish.

5321
04:01:04.028 --> 04:01:05.211
We'll say--

5322
04:01:05.211 --> 04:01:06.378
TRAVIS: Braveheart.

5323
04:01:06.378 --> 04:01:08.120
MATT: We'll just use this light as the mackerel there.

5324
04:01:08.120 --> 04:01:09.154
LIAM: That's not what I wanted to do.

5325
04:01:09.154 --> 04:01:12.435
MATT: So now (flopping)--

5326
04:01:12.435 --> 04:01:13.940
on the ground. We're talking, like,

5327
04:01:13.940 --> 04:01:15.570
Faith No More "Epic" video just like--

5328
04:01:15.570 --> 04:01:17.520
(flopping) on the ground.
TRAVIS: Good pull.

5329
04:01:17.520 --> 04:01:19.445
LIAM: And I will use the rest of my turn to say:

5330
04:01:19.445 --> 04:01:22.502
Throw it out one of the portholes.

5331
04:01:22.502 --> 04:01:23.337
SAM: Okay.

5332
04:01:23.337 --> 04:01:26.095
MATT: Okay. All right, that finishes Caleb's go.

5333
04:01:26.095 --> 04:01:29.130
It's now their turn. So it's the deep--

5334
04:01:29.130 --> 04:01:30.346
whatever. You don't know their names yet.

5335
04:01:30.346 --> 04:01:31.288
TRAVIS: The snea snawn.

5336
04:01:31.288 --> 04:01:32.663
LAURA: Pretty sure they can get--

5337
04:01:32.663 --> 04:01:34.965
TRAVIS: The deep what?
MATT: Nothing.

5338
04:01:34.965 --> 04:01:38.153
SAM: What happens to the people
in the Spirit Guardian--?

5339
04:01:38.153 --> 04:01:39.103
TRAVIS: (stabbing)

5340
04:01:39.103 --> 04:01:42.261
MARISHA: Ugh! Another tentacle attack!

5341
04:01:42.261 --> 04:01:43.102
Fuck!

5342
04:01:43.102 --> 04:01:45.405
TALIESIN: If don't want them to back off until--

5343
04:01:45.405 --> 04:01:47.472
If I can see a shift, I think I can pull it back.

5344
04:01:47.472 --> 04:01:50.332
MATT: I'm going to double check on that.

5345
04:01:50.332 --> 04:01:52.626
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's the-- my question.

5346
04:01:52.626 --> 04:01:55.658
MARISHA: I'm not into this. I'm not into this!

5347
04:01:55.658 --> 04:01:58.528
TRAVIS: Just kill me, man!
MARISHA: Not my kink!

5348
04:01:58.528 --> 04:02:01.204
MATT: When you cast the spell
you can designate targets.

5349
04:02:01.204 --> 04:02:03.502
So he's going to take damage. Okay.

5350
04:02:03.502 --> 04:02:05.652
So first, he makes the save.

5351
04:02:06.730 --> 04:02:09.130
Oh, that's a two, it's a failure, so--

5352
04:02:16.750 --> 04:02:20.980
25, I want to say? 25 points of damage.

5353
04:02:20.980 --> 04:02:23.613
MATT: Okay. I'll say a mackerel has one hit point.

5354
04:02:23.613 --> 04:02:26.563
Takes 24, immediately (bamfing).

5355
04:02:27.400 --> 04:02:29.054
LIAM: Yeah, good stuff.

5356
04:02:29.054 --> 04:02:30.857
(laughter)

5357
04:02:30.857 --> 04:02:32.478
MATT: He's looking really hurt though.

5358
04:02:32.478 --> 04:02:34.040
LAURA: That's good, though.

5359
04:02:34.040 --> 04:02:35.438
MATT: He's taken a lot of rough hits.

5360
04:02:35.438 --> 04:02:37.305
TALIESIN: Just double checking that it's 24.

5361
04:02:37.305 --> 04:02:39.180
MARISHA: I don't know, we didn't
really stick around for it.

5362
04:02:39.180 --> 04:02:41.245
She had her neck snapped.

5363
04:02:41.245 --> 04:02:42.726
TALIESIN: 24, uh--

5364
04:02:42.726 --> 04:02:44.998
Yeah. Radiant damage.

5365
04:02:44.998 --> 04:02:48.256
MATT: Okay, and that's him right there. Perfect.

5366
04:02:52.531 --> 04:02:54.560
So now it's the deep scions' turn.

5367
04:02:54.560 --> 04:02:58.460
This guy here is seeing you go up there.

5368
04:02:58.460 --> 04:02:59.510
What can he do?

5369
04:02:59.510 --> 04:03:01.552
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, he spent
his entire turn as a fish.

5370
04:03:01.552 --> 04:03:03.722
SAM: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: Cool.

5371
04:03:03.722 --> 04:03:05.960
MATT: Well, here, does it--

5372
04:03:05.960 --> 04:03:07.448
TALIESIN: Top of its turn, actually. No, shit.

5373
04:03:07.448 --> 04:03:08.581
MATT: Correct. So now he still has his turn to go.

5374
04:03:08.581 --> 04:03:11.040
TALIESIN: Yep. Never mind.
MATT: Okay.

5375
04:03:11.040 --> 04:03:13.620
In fact, we'll take his turn now.

5376
04:03:13.620 --> 04:03:18.620
He is going to go all in against Jester in front there.

5377
04:03:18.686 --> 04:03:20.152
First with the bite.

5378
04:03:20.152 --> 04:03:21.628
LAURA: I'm going to use--

5379
04:03:21.628 --> 04:03:23.547
MATT: That's a 19 to hit.

5380
04:03:23.547 --> 04:03:25.672
LAURA: 19 is my armor class.
MATT: So that hits.

5381
04:03:25.672 --> 04:03:28.133
LAURA: I'm going to use my reaction
to cast Hellish Rebuke.

5382
04:03:28.133 --> 04:03:29.291
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Go for it.

5383
04:03:29.291 --> 04:03:32.407
So first you take, from the bite attack...

5384
04:03:33.333 --> 04:03:35.031
eight points of piercing damage.

5385
04:03:35.031 --> 04:03:36.173
LAURA: Okay.

5386
04:03:37.679 --> 04:03:39.970
MATT: Need you to make a
constitution saving throw for me.

5387
04:03:41.204 --> 04:03:43.753
SAM: Ho-o-o-ly mackerel.

5388
04:03:43.753 --> 04:03:44.689
LAURA: 10.

5389
04:03:44.689 --> 04:03:46.305
MATT: All right, you're fine.
You maintain your Blade Barrier.

5390
04:03:46.305 --> 04:03:47.788
LAURA: Oh, okay.

5391
04:03:47.788 --> 04:03:49.733
MATT: And so now you have your Hellish Rebuke.

5392
04:03:49.733 --> 04:03:52.658
Constitution save or dexterity save for it? Wisdom save?

5393
04:03:53.814 --> 04:03:56.697
TALIESIN: I just want to get us
all out of the bottom of this fucking boat.

5394
04:03:56.697 --> 04:03:58.847
LAURA: That is...

5395
04:03:58.847 --> 04:03:59.688
dex save.

5396
04:03:59.688 --> 04:04:02.080
MATT: Dex save. That is a 17.

5397
04:04:02.080 --> 04:04:04.277
LAURA: He saves, but he still takes half damage.

5398
04:04:04.277 --> 04:04:06.393
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: So that's 3d10.

5399
04:04:09.783 --> 04:04:13.678
10, 14, so seven points of cold damage.

5400
04:04:13.678 --> 04:04:15.933
MATT: Seven points cold damage. He's hurt real bad.

5401
04:04:15.933 --> 04:04:17.450
TALIESIN: Ah!

5402
04:04:17.450 --> 04:04:19.291
ASHLEY: Come on.
SAM: Come on!

5403
04:04:19.291 --> 04:04:21.500
MATT: He's lucky he made that save.

5404
04:04:22.363 --> 04:04:23.596
Second attack against you, Jester.

5405
04:04:23.596 --> 04:04:25.412
It's going to be a claw attack.

5406
04:04:25.412 --> 04:04:27.532
And that's going to be a 13.

5407
04:04:27.532 --> 04:04:29.215
Misses, you push away from your shield,

5408
04:04:29.215 --> 04:04:33.264
and as you push away with the shield,
the ice digs into it.

5409
04:04:33.264 --> 04:04:35.095
Takes its rusted-ass blade

5410
04:04:35.095 --> 04:04:37.503
and back swings against you for...

5411
04:04:38.361 --> 04:04:40.052
16 to hit.
LAURA: You miss again!

5412
04:04:40.052 --> 04:04:41.624
MATT: You just stop it with the shield

5413
04:04:41.624 --> 04:04:43.539
and push him back in place.

5414
04:04:43.539 --> 04:04:44.772
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

5415
04:04:45.884 --> 04:04:47.217
MATT: This guy up here...

5416
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:51.250
he's going to go all in
on Orly because he's right there.

5417
04:04:51.250 --> 04:04:53.105
(groaning)

5418
04:04:53.105 --> 04:04:54.798
LAURA: No, Orly!

5419
04:04:54.798 --> 04:04:56.465
LIAM: God, we're eating shit here!

5420
04:04:56.465 --> 04:04:58.263
MATT: That's 22 to hit.

5421
04:04:58.263 --> 04:04:59.188
TALIESIN: Boo.
MARISHA: Jeez.

5422
04:05:00.188 --> 04:05:02.053
MATT: 16 to hits. That hits.

5423
04:05:02.053 --> 04:05:03.550
And--

5424
04:05:03.550 --> 04:05:05.530
yeah, all three hit.

5425
04:05:05.530 --> 04:05:06.913
So Orly takes...

5426
04:05:08.198 --> 04:05:09.318
eight points of--

5427
04:05:09.318 --> 04:05:11.766
LAURA: But the shell's really strong.

5428
04:05:11.766 --> 04:05:13.944
MATT: (quietly) That's piercing. Oh, it's a d6.

5429
04:05:13.944 --> 04:05:16.271
SAM: Maybe he can just sort of, (sucking sound)

5430
04:05:16.271 --> 04:05:18.388
suck himself back into the--
LAURA: He would if he wasn't stunned.

5431
04:05:18.388 --> 04:05:20.257
He can't do it.
SAM: Oh, he can't do it.

5432
04:05:20.257 --> 04:05:21.090
MATT: And then...

5433
04:05:22.048 --> 04:05:24.931
MARISHA: I think as tortles you can go into your-- uh huh--

5434
04:05:24.931 --> 04:05:27.378
and I think you get plus five to your AC when you do it.

5435
04:05:27.378 --> 04:05:28.428
But I think-- yeah.
LAURA: Ooh, that's cool.

5436
04:05:28.428 --> 04:05:30.011
SAM: But you roll around--

5437
04:05:30.011 --> 04:05:32.848
MATT: Orly is unconscious and bleeding out.

5438
04:05:32.848 --> 04:05:33.981
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

5439
04:05:33.981 --> 04:05:35.474
TRAVIS: Orly is unconscious and bleeding out.

5440
04:05:35.474 --> 04:05:36.307
SAM: Oh, no!

5441
04:05:36.307 --> 04:05:37.836
LAURA: Orly.

5442
04:05:37.836 --> 04:05:38.669
No!

5443
04:05:38.669 --> 04:05:42.723
SAM: You've got healing powers, don't you, Fjord?
TRAVIS: Not all the way up here.

5444
04:05:42.723 --> 04:05:43.690
MATT: That finishes

5445
04:05:43.690 --> 04:05:44.920
those guys' turn.

5446
04:05:44.920 --> 04:05:46.625
The stun wears off.

5447
04:05:46.625 --> 04:05:48.833
LAURA: Oh god.

5448
04:05:48.833 --> 04:05:50.631
SAM: Maybe Marius is a healer.

5449
04:05:51.523 --> 04:05:54.876
Eyy, Yasha can move!
ASHLEY: Eyy!

5450
04:05:54.876 --> 04:05:56.405
TALIESIN: For a little while.
MATT: This guy is still in bed

5451
04:05:56.405 --> 04:05:57.370
like, "What's going on?"

5452
04:05:57.370 --> 04:05:58.558
LAURA: And that other guy, too.

5453
04:05:58.558 --> 04:06:00.822
"Oh man, what's all these beetles around me?"

5454
04:06:00.822 --> 04:06:02.620
MATT: "I keep hearing--" Yeah. "What's going on out there?"

5455
04:06:02.620 --> 04:06:04.340
TALIESIN: (buzzes)
MATT: All righty.

5456
04:06:04.340 --> 04:06:06.066
Thank you for the sound effect.

5457
04:06:06.066 --> 04:06:07.912
All right, that finishes their go.

5458
04:06:07.912 --> 04:06:10.553
Caduceus and Veth, you guys are up.

5459
04:06:11.520 --> 04:06:14.850
TALIESIN: I'm going to move...

5460
04:06:14.850 --> 04:06:19.372
First thing I'm going to do, actually, is I'm going to cast

5461
04:06:19.372 --> 04:06:22.379
Sacred Flame on that jerk right in front of us.

5462
04:06:22.379 --> 04:06:23.237
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

5463
04:06:25.072 --> 04:06:26.955
TALIESIN: For my action.
MATT: Sacred Flame?

5464
04:06:26.955 --> 04:06:29.222
TALIESIN: Yeah. That guy.

5465
04:06:29.222 --> 04:06:30.230
MATT: Okay.

5466
04:06:30.230 --> 04:06:32.197
Dexterity save. No, that's a fail.

5467
04:06:32.197 --> 04:06:33.981
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's...

5468
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:39.228
13, 18 points of radiant damage.

5469
04:06:39.228 --> 04:06:41.760
MATT: You watch as the radiant burst bursts in the chest

5470
04:06:41.760 --> 04:06:43.702
and as he pulls back, the beetles

5471
04:06:43.702 --> 04:06:47.152
swarm into the wounds and start pouring out of the eyes

5472
04:06:47.152 --> 04:06:48.865
and the ears, eating them from the inside.

5473
04:06:48.865 --> 04:06:49.823
TALIESIN: I'm not in the mood.

5474
04:06:49.823 --> 04:06:51.867
LAURA: I'm just watching it like (gagging).

5475
04:06:51.867 --> 04:06:55.390
TALIESIN: I'm going to step and
take my full movement forward.

5476
04:06:55.390 --> 04:06:57.553
LAURA: I'm in shock from seeing that.

5477
04:06:57.553 --> 04:07:01.204
MATT: 10, 15, 20,

5478
04:07:01.204 --> 04:07:05.620
you can get, like, in the space-- I'll say there.

5479
04:07:05.620 --> 04:07:08.940
TALIESIN: Can I not get right next-- I will move--

5480
04:07:08.940 --> 04:07:11.818
MATT: I can say you can move--
TALIESIN: Into their combat zone.

5481
04:07:11.818 --> 04:07:14.412
I'm okay moving into their combat zone.

5482
04:07:14.412 --> 04:07:16.920
MATT: 5, 10, 15,

5483
04:07:16.920 --> 04:07:18.837
20. That's the rest of your movement

5484
04:07:18.837 --> 04:07:20.715
to climb over the cannon to get there.
TALIESIN: No problem.

5485
04:07:20.715 --> 04:07:22.036
All right.

5486
04:07:22.036 --> 04:07:24.159
MATT: That'll move that to the right.
LAURA: Ooh, very nice.

5487
04:07:24.159 --> 04:07:27.652
TALIESIN: I feel like they're all within 15.

5488
04:07:27.652 --> 04:07:28.934
They're all in there.

5489
04:07:28.934 --> 04:07:31.567
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

5490
04:07:31.567 --> 04:07:33.637
Yeah. Um...

5491
04:07:33.637 --> 04:07:34.470
SAM: You've moved into their combat--

5492
04:07:34.470 --> 04:07:36.970
TALIESIN: As a bonus action, since I-- no, that was

5493
04:07:36.970 --> 04:07:39.192
a cantrip, so I could still

5494
04:07:39.192 --> 04:07:42.122
use a bonus action to cast a spell?
MATT: You can.

5495
04:07:42.122 --> 04:07:42.963
TALIESIN: It's a bonus action--

5496
04:07:42.963 --> 04:07:44.896
where's my bonus action spell--
LAURA: You can do healing.

5497
04:07:44.896 --> 04:07:47.070
I'm going to do--

5498
04:07:47.070 --> 04:07:51.257
just to help a little bit, I'm going to do...

5499
04:07:53.103 --> 04:07:54.561
Healing Word

5500
04:07:56.715 --> 04:07:59.733
just at level two. We're just going to do

5501
04:07:59.733 --> 04:08:02.102
a little spruce up for Veth there.

5502
04:08:02.102 --> 04:08:03.308
TRAVIS: "Little spruce up"?
MATT: Go for it.

5503
04:08:03.308 --> 04:08:04.918
TRAVIS: A come up.

5504
04:08:04.918 --> 04:08:07.085
TALIESIN: That kind of sucks, but that's okay.

5505
04:08:07.085 --> 04:08:08.293
10 points of healing.

5506
04:08:08.293 --> 04:08:09.126
SAM: That's great!

5507
04:08:09.126 --> 04:08:10.982
MATT: Doesn't hurt.
TALIESIN: So you're up 10.

5508
04:08:10.982 --> 04:08:13.620
MATT: All right, that finishes
Caduceus' turn. Veth, you're up.

5509
04:08:13.620 --> 04:08:16.846
SAM: Caduceus moved into combat
range of the one right in front

5510
04:08:16.846 --> 04:08:19.374
of me, as in "is engaged with"?

5511
04:08:19.374 --> 04:08:20.474
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

5512
04:08:20.474 --> 04:08:21.811
SAM: Yeah.

5513
04:08:21.811 --> 04:08:23.461
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Yep, yep, yep.

5514
04:08:23.461 --> 04:08:25.009
SAM: (gun cocking noise)

5515
04:08:25.009 --> 04:08:26.397
Bye bye!

5516
04:08:26.397 --> 04:08:28.268
I'll just shoot him in the face.

5517
04:08:28.268 --> 04:08:30.280
MATT: All righty. You are--

5518
04:08:30.280 --> 04:08:33.470
SAM: Come on. Oh, fuck shit balls shit.

5519
04:08:33.470 --> 04:08:34.970
MATT: You have disadvantage on your attack roll.

5520
04:08:34.970 --> 04:08:36.486
SAM: Oh, even worse.

5521
04:08:38.602 --> 04:08:41.378
Okay, that is a 14 to hit.

5522
04:08:41.378 --> 04:08:42.350
MATT: 14 hits.

5523
04:08:42.350 --> 04:08:43.820
(cheering)

5524
04:08:43.820 --> 04:08:46.250
These guys don't have an amazing armor class.

5525
04:08:46.250 --> 04:08:47.083
SAM: Okay.

5526
04:08:48.672 --> 04:08:50.170
TRAVIS: That's pretty great.

5527
04:08:50.170 --> 04:08:54.328
SAM: Okay, we got 10, we got 20, we got 24,

5528
04:08:54.328 --> 04:08:58.172
we got 30 points of damage.

5529
04:08:58.172 --> 04:09:03.170
MATT: Nice! As its tentacles' wrapped
around, it's like (wet grunt, gasp)

5530
04:09:03.170 --> 04:09:05.082
and you see, like, the sucking sound from the wound

5531
04:09:05.082 --> 04:09:07.470
that's, like, the bolt is partially withdrawn from beneath

5532
04:09:07.470 --> 04:09:11.155
the sternum. It's leaking this
seawater-like liquid out of the wound.

5533
04:09:11.155 --> 04:09:13.152
SAM: Gross. Reload, fire again.

5534
04:09:13.152 --> 04:09:14.920
MATT: Go for it.

5535
04:09:14.920 --> 04:09:16.990
SAM: Even worse. 13!

5536
04:09:16.990 --> 04:09:19.678
Oh and at disadvantage. 13 to hit.

5537
04:09:19.678 --> 04:09:20.649
MATT: 13 just hits.

5538
04:09:20.649 --> 04:09:22.500
(cheering)

5539
04:09:22.500 --> 04:09:23.667
SAM: Look at that!
ASHLEY: There we go.

5540
04:09:24.820 --> 04:09:26.913
SAM: Another 12 points of damage.

5541
04:09:26.913 --> 04:09:28.080
MATT: 12 points of damage. He's looking hurt.

5542
04:09:28.080 --> 04:09:29.773
SAM: No!

5543
04:09:29.773 --> 04:09:34.130
MARISHA: Damn it, this guy. What a dick.
MATT: That finish your turn?

5544
04:09:34.130 --> 04:09:35.540
SAM: Yeah. No movement.

5545
04:09:35.540 --> 04:09:36.420
MATT: All right.

5546
04:09:36.420 --> 04:09:38.653
SAM: Goddamn it! Thank you, Caduceus.

5547
04:09:38.653 --> 04:09:40.138
MATT: The crew's turn.

5548
04:09:40.138 --> 04:09:44.830
Marius is moving ahead and he turns and goes, "Orly!"

5549
04:09:45.726 --> 04:09:47.115
and he's going to attempt to strike

5550
04:09:47.115 --> 04:09:49.097
the guy that's next to him.

5551
04:09:49.097 --> 04:09:50.915
MARISHA: Come on, Marius.

5552
04:09:50.915 --> 04:09:53.524
Do something useful.

5553
04:09:53.524 --> 04:09:56.182
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow! Really? Now?

5554
04:09:56.182 --> 04:09:57.245
MATT: That's an 11. Misses.

5555
04:09:57.245 --> 04:09:59.355
TRAVIS: We told him we needed a kill!

5556
04:09:59.355 --> 04:10:00.310
MATT: And an eight.

5557
04:10:00.310 --> 04:10:02.595
Literally, I think if you hadn't done that, he would've

5558
04:10:02.595 --> 04:10:04.972
rolled better. Fucking missed with both attacks.

5559
04:10:04.972 --> 04:10:06.858
LAURA: Oh, poor Marius! He's doing terrible!
TRAVIS: That's on you!

5560
04:10:06.858 --> 04:10:07.968
MARISHA: I didn't do that!

5561
04:10:07.968 --> 04:10:10.126
MATT: We'll say the Charm Person has worn off--
MARISHA: The dice did that.

5562
04:10:10.126 --> 04:10:11.962
MATT: -- because Orly is no longer conscious.

5563
04:10:11.962 --> 04:10:13.028
TALIESIN: Oh no.

5564
04:10:13.028 --> 04:10:14.791
SAM: Orly is no longer alive?

5565
04:10:14.791 --> 04:10:15.634
LAURA: Conscious.

5566
04:10:15.634 --> 04:10:16.467
SAM: Jesus.

5567
04:10:17.828 --> 04:10:21.150
MATT: Yeah, I will say-- let
me double check real fast.

5568
04:10:21.150 --> 04:10:23.058
SAM: Is he doing death saves at this point?

5569
04:10:23.058 --> 04:10:24.341
TALIESIN: Yep.

5570
04:10:24.341 --> 04:10:26.802
I mean, not yet, but yeah.

5571
04:10:26.802 --> 04:10:28.755
Top of his turn, he'll take--
SAM: If we lose this tortle, that's bad.

5572
04:10:28.755 --> 04:10:31.509
MATT: You know, it's not a concentration spell.

5573
04:10:31.509 --> 04:10:34.142
TALIESIN: Hey, thank you!
MATT: I'll say--

5574
04:10:34.142 --> 04:10:38.622
I'll say it maintains for now.
For the next hour or so. Or-- yeah.

5575
04:10:38.622 --> 04:10:42.046
All right so, that finishes his go there.

5576
04:10:42.046 --> 04:10:43.421
TRAVIS: This is fucking wild.

5577
04:10:43.421 --> 04:10:48.421
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

5578
04:10:49.170 --> 04:10:51.737
He sees the blade barrier and is like,
"What the fuck is going on?"

5579
04:10:51.737 --> 04:10:52.870
TALIESIN: Go with it.
MATT: He's just going to

5580
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:55.073
run up onto the top here of the crate

5581
04:10:55.073 --> 04:10:56.733
that holds all the cannonballs up there

5582
04:10:56.733 --> 04:10:58.773
and is getting in a position to attack the guy

5583
04:10:58.773 --> 04:11:02.653
that's between Caduceus and themself.

5584
04:11:02.653 --> 04:11:05.215
So Shelda is just up there,
but they used their action

5585
04:11:05.215 --> 04:11:07.230
to get up there, so that's their turn.

5586
04:11:07.230 --> 04:11:09.171
These guys can go. "Oh no, the hell's going on?"

5587
04:11:09.171 --> 04:11:12.692
SAM: "Oh, maybe I should go
and wake up, brush my teeth."

5588
04:11:12.692 --> 04:11:14.717
TRAVIS: Are any of those people Shelda?

5589
04:11:14.717 --> 04:11:17.035
SAM: Yeah, Shelda is the one
who just hopped up on the thing

5590
04:11:17.035 --> 04:11:18.272
and did not betray us.

5591
04:11:18.272 --> 04:11:19.913
LAURA: Oh, that's Gallan? Oops.

5592
04:11:19.913 --> 04:11:21.861
Of course he would sleep in the deck below.
SAM: Now don't you feel guilty?

5593
04:11:21.861 --> 04:11:25.226
TRAVIS: No. It's a pirate's life.

5594
04:11:25.226 --> 04:11:27.694
MATT: Yep. All right, back at the top.

5595
04:11:27.694 --> 04:11:29.309
TALIESIN: Oh, you still have your Spiritual Weapon up.
MATT: Jester, you're up.

5596
04:11:29.309 --> 04:11:31.055
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon

5597
04:11:31.055 --> 04:11:33.225
to attack the dude that's holding Nott.

5598
04:11:33.225 --> 04:11:35.464
MATT: You got it, go ahead and roll an attack.

5599
04:11:38.093 --> 04:11:39.093
LAURA: Oh!

5600
04:11:40.459 --> 04:11:41.392
23.

5601
04:11:41.392 --> 04:11:42.392
MATT: That hits.

5602
04:11:45.280 --> 04:11:48.063
LAURA: Woo, that's-- there it is. 20 points.

5603
04:11:48.063 --> 04:11:49.097
MATT: 20 points.

5604
04:11:49.097 --> 04:11:51.218
As the tentacle's squeezing Veth.

5605
04:11:51.218 --> 04:11:53.767
And you see Veth is (groaning) in the middle of its grasp.

5606
04:11:53.767 --> 04:11:56.690
It's not even looking up
at you, it glances up at Shelda.

5607
04:11:56.690 --> 04:11:58.977
LAURA: Ooh, I'm going to use the
Spiritual Weapon like a bat.

5608
04:11:58.977 --> 04:12:01.068
It's going to hit him and
it's going to slam him

5609
04:12:01.068 --> 04:12:03.277
into the Blade Barrier.
MATT: Okay.

5610
04:12:03.277 --> 04:12:05.217
So as it swings wide it--

5611
04:12:05.217 --> 04:12:07.910
whack-- smacks it upside the head and the shoulder

5612
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:11.026
with just enough momentum to spin up over.

5613
04:12:11.026 --> 04:12:13.309
Shelda gets down low as the tentacle unravels,

5614
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:17.387
spins over Shelda's back and
goes right into the blade wall.

5615
04:12:17.387 --> 04:12:20.051
It just gets wood chippered against that wall.

5616
04:12:20.051 --> 04:12:23.258
TRAVIS: (cackles)

5617
04:12:23.258 --> 04:12:24.947
Yes, yes.

5618
04:12:24.947 --> 04:12:25.813
LAURA: Sweet.

5619
04:12:25.813 --> 04:12:28.735
I'm going to run forward as
much as my movement will let me.

5620
04:12:28.735 --> 04:12:30.189
MATT: All righty.

5621
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:32.088
SAM: What a mess that deck is.

5622
04:12:32.088 --> 04:12:34.763
LAURA: I know, this is just
fucking chaos in here.

5623
04:12:34.763 --> 04:12:37.171
MATT: 25, that's as--
LAURA: Well I'll use some of it--

5624
04:12:37.171 --> 04:12:38.870
I don't want to be right up next to this dude.

5625
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:40.430
MATT: So there?

5626
04:12:40.430 --> 04:12:43.071
LAURA: And then I'm going to cast--

5627
04:12:43.071 --> 04:12:44.246
what is this?

5628
04:12:45.850 --> 04:12:48.478
At 2nd-level, I'm going
to cast Guiding Bolt

5629
04:12:48.478 --> 04:12:50.713
at this guy with Yasha.

5630
04:12:50.713 --> 04:12:52.502
MATT: Okay, go for it.

5631
04:12:52.502 --> 04:12:55.536
SAM: Popsicles, knives, beetles.

5632
04:12:55.536 --> 04:12:56.852
It's madness.

5633
04:12:56.852 --> 04:12:58.010
LAURA: 13.

5634
04:12:58.010 --> 04:12:59.177
MATT: 13 just hits.

5635
04:13:00.345 --> 04:13:03.982
MARISHA: Like the end of Poltergeist, just--

5636
04:13:03.982 --> 04:13:05.817
LAURA: 5d6.

5637
04:13:05.817 --> 04:13:06.850
MATT: Do it.

5638
04:13:06.850 --> 04:13:09.759
LAURA: One, two, three, four, five.

5639
04:13:11.159 --> 04:13:13.075
SAM: Ooh. Great stuff.
LAURA: Ooh!

5640
04:13:13.075 --> 04:13:16.870
11, 15, 17, 16 points.

5641
04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:18.010
MATT: 16 points.

5642
04:13:18.010 --> 04:13:20.068
SAM: You said 17 then 16?

5643
04:13:20.068 --> 04:13:22.757
LAURA: Oh yeah, I totally-- 18, yeah,

5644
04:13:22.757 --> 04:13:24.650
18 points and then--

5645
04:13:24.650 --> 04:13:27.349
TRAVIS: Oh, he's out.
LAURA: Sweet!

5646
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:29.500
MATT: The bolt smashes into him
and falls back into the wall

5647
04:13:29.500 --> 04:13:32.333
and is looking over towards Yasha

5648
04:13:32.333 --> 04:13:35.931
and angrily goes to strike
as the arm just burns away

5649
04:13:35.931 --> 04:13:38.058
as the Guiding Bolt divine
energy begins to just tear

5650
04:13:38.058 --> 04:13:40.122
up the side and as it does,
you can just generally hear

5651
04:13:40.122 --> 04:13:45.117
the laughter of The Traveler
enjoying this embarrassing demise.

5652
04:13:45.117 --> 04:13:46.772
LAURA: I'm going to use
the rest of my movement now

5653
04:13:46.772 --> 04:13:48.650
to run towards the stairs as much as I can.

5654
04:13:48.650 --> 04:13:51.425
SAM: So we've cleared the deck?
LAURA: We cleared the deck.

5655
04:13:51.425 --> 04:13:52.474
SAM: Clear the decks!

5656
04:13:52.474 --> 04:13:54.093
MATT: That's as far as you can get
with the rest of your movement.

5657
04:13:54.093 --> 04:13:56.313
SAM: Who's that, is that me?
LAURA: Yeah, you're there.

5658
04:13:56.313 --> 04:13:57.755
MATT: There's you and there's a guy
right there on the other side.

5659
04:13:57.755 --> 04:14:00.053
SAM: Oh, there is a guy.
MATT: Yep.

5660
04:14:00.053 --> 04:14:03.136
MARISHA: Are you still on the ground?
SAM: I'm still lying in my bed.

5661
04:14:05.991 --> 04:14:06.874
MATT: All right.
LAURA: We're all, like,

5662
04:14:06.874 --> 04:14:09.762
tripping over the hammock that goes across.

5663
04:14:09.762 --> 04:14:11.400
MATT: Jester's turn's done.

5664
04:14:11.400 --> 04:14:12.809
Beau, you're up.

5665
04:14:12.809 --> 04:14:14.933
MARISHA: Ah, okay!

5666
04:14:14.933 --> 04:14:17.865
Inspired by the storm
and these fish fucks.

5667
04:14:17.865 --> 04:14:19.814
I'm going to do--

5668
04:14:19.814 --> 04:14:21.705
light up my lightning gloves.

5669
04:14:21.705 --> 04:14:24.747
MATT: You got it.
MARISHA: And after seeing

5670
04:14:25.763 --> 04:14:29.145
fish fuck over here take down
Orly, I'm going to ignore this--

5671
04:14:29.145 --> 04:14:31.197
I'm going to look at Marius and be like:

5672
04:14:31.197 --> 04:14:33.384
Kill him. We need a kill.

5673
04:14:33.384 --> 04:14:35.602
And then I'm going to go deal with this guy.

5674
04:14:35.602 --> 04:14:36.668
MATT: This guy there?
MARISHA: Yeah.

5675
04:14:36.668 --> 04:14:39.960
MATT: All right. So you dart over to here,
you're coming up on the edge there.

5676
04:14:39.960 --> 04:14:41.010
MARISHA: Yes, I will.

5677
04:14:41.010 --> 04:14:43.573
MATT: All right, so as you rush up
to the side of that guy, go for it.

5678
04:14:43.573 --> 04:14:46.318
MARISHA: I do, like, a front flip onto the step?

5679
04:14:46.318 --> 04:14:47.951
MATT: Hell yeah.
MARISHA: And then pop pop.

5680
04:14:47.951 --> 04:14:50.051
MATT: Hell yeah.
SAM: (mumbles) A-pop pop.

5681
04:14:51.169 --> 04:14:53.569
MARISHA: That's not it, that doesn't count.

5682
04:14:55.095 --> 04:14:57.362
Okay, a 19 and a 17,

5683
04:14:57.362 --> 04:15:00.112
so 29 and 27.

5684
04:15:00.112 --> 04:15:02.853
MATT: Both hit. Nice.

5685
04:15:02.853 --> 04:15:06.107
TRAVIS: Big rolls, damn.
MARISHA: Yeah, those were great.

5686
04:15:06.107 --> 04:15:07.865
And then would you please plus--

5687
04:15:07.865 --> 04:15:09.520
All right, not too bad.

5688
04:15:09.520 --> 04:15:10.354
10.

5689
04:15:10.354 --> 04:15:12.434
18.

5690
04:15:12.434 --> 04:15:13.867
18 plus another six.

5691
04:15:13.867 --> 04:15:16.259
23 points of damage

5692
04:15:16.259 --> 04:15:17.367
on those two pops.

5693
04:15:17.367 --> 04:15:18.683
MATT: Nice.

5694
04:15:18.683 --> 04:15:19.988
MARISHA: A stunning strike!

5695
04:15:19.988 --> 04:15:21.388
MATT: All righty.

5696
04:15:21.388 --> 04:15:23.413
MARISHA: Should have done it on the first one, but--

5697
04:15:23.413 --> 04:15:25.273
MATT: Ooh! Natural 18.

5698
04:15:25.273 --> 04:15:27.481
MARISHA: Damn it. Fucking shit.

5699
04:15:28.476 --> 04:15:29.517
Flurry of Blows!

5700
04:15:29.517 --> 04:15:30.517
MATT: Go for it.

5701
04:15:31.397 --> 04:15:33.674
MARISHA: Pop, pop, pop.

5702
04:15:33.674 --> 04:15:35.132
LIAM: Bob, bob.
MARISHA: Ew.

5703
04:15:35.132 --> 04:15:38.354
Those were not great. 15 and 18.

5704
04:15:38.354 --> 04:15:40.278
MATT: The 18 hits.

5705
04:15:40.278 --> 04:15:41.111
MARISHA: Okay.

5706
04:15:42.455 --> 04:15:43.355
Okay.

5707
04:15:43.355 --> 04:15:45.248
12.
MATT: 12 points of damage.

5708
04:15:45.248 --> 04:15:46.089
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

5709
04:15:46.089 --> 04:15:48.051
MATT: Stunning Strike.

5710
04:15:48.051 --> 04:15:49.525
(cackles)

5711
04:15:49.525 --> 04:15:50.367
19.

5712
04:15:50.367 --> 04:15:51.650
TRAVIS: Wow!

5713
04:15:51.650 --> 04:15:55.425
MATT: I'm rolling really good this battle.
It's making me happy.

5714
04:15:55.425 --> 04:15:58.382
MARISHA: And extract those aspects.

5715
04:15:58.382 --> 04:15:59.632
MATT: Indeed.

5716
04:16:01.190 --> 04:16:03.214
Not immune to any damage,

5717
04:16:03.214 --> 04:16:04.765
not resistant to any damage

5718
04:16:04.765 --> 04:16:06.908
and not immune to any conditions.

5719
04:16:06.908 --> 04:16:08.890
It is a free open market on this guy.

5720
04:16:08.890 --> 04:16:10.098
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

5721
04:16:11.013 --> 04:16:12.210
TRAVIS: Cool.

5722
04:16:12.210 --> 04:16:13.043
MARISHA: Okay.

5723
04:16:15.632 --> 04:16:16.715
That's my turn.

5724
04:16:16.715 --> 04:16:17.715
MATT: All right.

5725
04:16:19.865 --> 04:16:21.615
This fella up here.

5726
04:16:22.698 --> 04:16:25.350
It's going to go ahead and look over the side

5727
04:16:25.350 --> 04:16:28.523
of the ship down into the waters.

5728
04:16:28.523 --> 04:16:32.760
And it's just going to sit there and survey the territory.

5729
04:16:32.760 --> 04:16:35.507
That brings us to Fjord. Your turn.

5730
04:16:35.507 --> 04:16:36.340
TRAVIS: Great.

5731
04:16:36.340 --> 04:16:40.440
I'll use half my movement to stand up out of prone.

5732
04:16:40.440 --> 04:16:41.592
I'm going to lean over the railing and s--

5733
04:16:41.592 --> 04:16:43.456
MATT: As soon as you lean over,

5734
04:16:43.456 --> 04:16:45.871
he was holding his action to Eldritch Blast you.

5735
04:16:45.871 --> 04:16:47.802
MARISHA: Oh my god.

5736
04:16:47.802 --> 04:16:49.943
MATT: You are, with the railing, you have a do have a bonus.

5737
04:16:49.943 --> 04:16:52.337
You have half cover, I'm giving you,
so it's plus two your AC.

5738
04:16:52.337 --> 04:16:54.325
TALIESIN: Oh.
MARISHA: And the pillows.

5739
04:16:54.325 --> 04:16:55.778
MATT: That is a 14. That still hits.

5740
04:16:55.778 --> 04:16:56.614
TRAVIS: Yep.

5741
04:16:56.614 --> 04:16:57.448
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

5742
04:16:57.448 --> 04:16:58.864
SAM: [inaudible], Fjord.

5743
04:17:00.720 --> 04:17:02.553
MATT: You take eight points of force damage.

5744
04:17:02.553 --> 04:17:04.570
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yep.

5745
04:17:04.570 --> 04:17:07.177
MATT: Ooh! Natural 19.

5746
04:17:07.177 --> 04:17:09.043
Yeah. You take

5747
04:17:09.043 --> 04:17:10.398
10 points of force damage.

5748
04:17:10.398 --> 04:17:12.073
TRAVIS: Boof!
SAM: Oh no!

5749
04:17:12.073 --> 04:17:13.292
TRAVIS: I go unconscious.

5750
04:17:13.292 --> 04:17:15.016
MATT: And with the third and final hit.

5751
04:17:15.016 --> 04:17:17.336
TALIESIN: Would not hit him because
he would fall prone, wouldn't he?

5752
04:17:17.336 --> 04:17:19.527
MATT: No, it's all (three quick impacts). It's all at once.

5753
04:17:20.448 --> 04:17:22.260
So the third blast immediately,

5754
04:17:22.260 --> 04:17:23.718
takes away a death saving throw from you.

5755
04:17:23.718 --> 04:17:24.560
TRAVIS: Okay.

5756
04:17:24.560 --> 04:17:26.280
LAURA: But, no, you come right back.

5757
04:17:26.280 --> 04:17:28.127
TRAVIS: I do have Relentless Endurance.

5758
04:17:28.127 --> 04:17:29.893
MATT: That's true. So you're back to one hit point,

5759
04:17:29.893 --> 04:17:31.507
and then you get hit with the last blow.

5760
04:17:31.507 --> 04:17:32.978
LIAM: So you got all your death saves.

5761
04:17:32.978 --> 04:17:34.792
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Which is important.

5762
04:17:34.792 --> 04:17:36.458
MATT: Now.
TRAVIS: I'm just up on a crow's nest.

5763
04:17:36.458 --> 04:17:37.291
MARISHA: Alone.
MATT: Well,

5764
04:17:37.291 --> 04:17:39.015
here's the thing.

5765
04:17:39.015 --> 04:17:42.280
You said you were leaning over the railing.

5766
04:17:42.280 --> 04:17:44.447
I need you to go ahead and roll a d20 for me.
TRAVIS: Okay.

5767
04:17:44.447 --> 04:17:47.352
MATT: On a one to 10, you fall over the edge.

5768
04:17:47.352 --> 04:17:49.550
On an 11 or higher, you fall back into the crow's nest.

5769
04:17:49.550 --> 04:17:51.545
SAM: Oh boy, this is the end.

5770
04:17:51.545 --> 04:17:52.921
TRAVIS: Eight.

5771
04:17:52.921 --> 04:17:55.215
SAM: Oh no!

5772
04:17:55.215 --> 04:17:57.112
LIAM: No, he's dead.
MARISHA: Well, no.

5773
04:17:57.112 --> 04:18:00.385
TRAVIS: I don't really know how I would-- It's fine.

5774
04:18:00.385 --> 04:18:03.176
LAURA: Like, it's splat.

5775
04:18:03.176 --> 04:18:04.076
MATT: Well.

5776
04:18:04.076 --> 04:18:05.526
ASHLEY: No, no, no.

5777
04:18:06.383 --> 04:18:07.556
MATT: Did you have a comment, you said?

5778
04:18:07.556 --> 04:18:09.004
TRAVIS: Nope.

5779
04:18:09.004 --> 04:18:10.645
Nope. No comment.

5780
04:18:12.202 --> 04:18:14.435
SAM: Oh boy.
ASHLEY: Is he going to fall prone from the mast?

5781
04:18:16.482 --> 04:18:18.680
TALIESIN: Could go a lot of ways here.

5782
04:18:18.680 --> 04:18:20.916
SAM: Rolling dama-- What is he rolling damage for?

5783
04:18:20.916 --> 04:18:22.843
LIAM: It's 1d6 for every ten feet.

5784
04:18:22.843 --> 04:18:25.599
SAM: No, I know, but these are death saves.

5785
04:18:25.599 --> 04:18:27.847
TALIESIN: No, but there may not need to be one.

5786
04:18:27.847 --> 04:18:29.588
LIAM: If he rolls a number higher than Fjord's

5787
04:18:29.588 --> 04:18:30.710
hit point total, it would auto-kill.

5788
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:32.420
MATT: Yeah, which wouldn't happen, so it's fine.

5789
04:18:32.420 --> 04:18:34.160
I'm just rolling it because it's fun.

5790
04:18:34.160 --> 04:18:37.697
All right, so you impact onto the wet deck of the ship.

5791
04:18:37.697 --> 04:18:39.952
You do fail one death save.

5792
04:18:39.952 --> 04:18:41.610
TRAVIS: Just one?
MATT: Just one.

5793
04:18:41.610 --> 04:18:43.063
SAM: Okay, it's not terrible.

5794
04:18:43.063 --> 04:18:43.896
MATT: Just one.

5795
04:18:43.896 --> 04:18:46.660
MARISHA: Beau just screams out at the sight of it.

5796
04:18:46.660 --> 04:18:48.430
MATT: Crack! You hear that impact and you turn.

5797
04:18:48.430 --> 04:18:50.588
TRAVIS: Isn't that two because I'm already unconscious?

5798
04:18:50.588 --> 04:18:53.219
MATT: Hmm? No. It's only a melee attack.

5799
04:18:53.219 --> 04:18:56.506
Well, "critical hit" does two death saves,

5800
04:18:56.506 --> 04:18:58.418
and you only get the critical hit automatically

5801
04:18:58.418 --> 04:19:00.960
if it's a melee attack.
TRAVIS: Okay.

5802
04:19:00.960 --> 04:19:04.718
MARISHA: I just scream my head off and I just scream: Fjord!

5803
04:19:04.718 --> 04:19:05.551
MATT: All righty.

5804
04:19:05.551 --> 04:19:06.851
LAURA: Can we hear it, did we hear that below deck?

5805
04:19:06.851 --> 04:19:07.972
MATT: Yeah, you did.

5806
04:19:07.972 --> 04:19:09.521
TRAVIS: He baited me into that.

5807
04:19:09.521 --> 04:19:13.680
LAURA: I instantly drop my Blade Barrier.

5808
04:19:13.680 --> 04:19:16.132
MATT: You drop Blade Barrier?
LAURA: Uh-huh.

5809
04:19:16.132 --> 04:19:17.975
MATT: We'll say on your turn, we'll drop it.

5810
04:19:17.975 --> 04:19:19.533
All right, Yasha, you're up.

5811
04:19:19.533 --> 04:19:22.580
ASHLEY: Okay. Seeing that everything's done down here,

5812
04:19:22.580 --> 04:19:24.564
I'm going to run up the stairs.

5813
04:19:24.564 --> 04:19:26.548
MATT: Okay. You run this way.

5814
04:19:26.548 --> 04:19:30.095
The guy who's on the inside of the barrier
does get an attack of opportunity on you.

5815
04:19:30.095 --> 04:19:31.395
ASHLEY: Wait.
TALIESIN: Oh, there's one left?

5816
04:19:31.395 --> 04:19:32.707
LAURA: There's a guy in here?
MATT: Right there.

5817
04:19:32.707 --> 04:19:33.866
TALIESIN: Oh, there is one left.

5818
04:19:33.866 --> 04:19:35.678
LAURA: Oh, none of us can see that guy.
TALIESIN: Okay.

5819
04:19:35.678 --> 04:19:36.993
ASHLEY: Oh, I didn't know there was another guy.

5820
04:19:36.993 --> 04:19:37.826
MATT: That's okay.

5821
04:19:37.826 --> 04:19:39.817
Do you still want to keep going
or you want to stay and fight?

5822
04:19:41.425 --> 04:19:43.173
ASHLEY: I heard a scream. Did we hear that?

5823
04:19:43.173 --> 04:19:44.006
MATT: Yeah, you heard a scream.

5824
04:19:44.006 --> 04:19:45.423
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to start running upstairs.

5825
04:19:45.423 --> 04:19:46.353
MATT: Okay.

5826
04:19:46.353 --> 04:19:48.746
It will take an attack of opportunity.

5827
04:19:48.746 --> 04:19:50.078
TALIESIN: He ain't going to do nothing to you, anyway.

5828
04:19:50.078 --> 04:19:51.879
ASHLEY: That's fine.

5829
04:19:51.879 --> 04:19:53.029
TALIESIN: If he even hits.

5830
04:19:53.029 --> 04:19:55.567
MATT: That's that's going to be a

5831
04:19:55.567 --> 04:19:56.604
17.

5832
04:19:56.604 --> 04:19:57.970
ASHLEY: Yeah, just hits.
TALIESIN: Motherfuckers.

5833
04:19:57.970 --> 04:19:59.870
MATT: All right.

5834
04:19:59.870 --> 04:20:04.150
You take-- that'd be with the poison quills. So that'd be

5835
04:20:04.150 --> 04:20:05.770
nine points of poison damage.

5836
04:20:05.770 --> 04:20:07.712
I need you to make a
constitution saving throw for me.

5837
04:20:12.447 --> 04:20:13.280
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5838
04:20:16.647 --> 04:20:18.383
27.
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

5839
04:20:18.383 --> 04:20:20.066
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yay, con.

5840
04:20:22.500 --> 04:20:24.932
MATT: 30. As you emerge outside,
immediately there next to you,

5841
04:20:24.932 --> 04:20:27.722
you see one of the quilled

5842
04:20:27.722 --> 04:20:31.521
sea spawn creatures right there like (heavy breathing).

5843
04:20:31.521 --> 04:20:32.737
ASHLEY: Okay.

5844
04:20:33.585 --> 04:20:35.002
So I see.

5845
04:20:36.283 --> 04:20:39.285
MATT: You don't see-- you could maybe
barely see Fjord's hand

5846
04:20:39.285 --> 04:20:42.557
just past where the mast hits the deck.

5847
04:20:42.557 --> 04:20:44.717
LAURA: Would the sword have disappeared immediately

5848
04:20:44.717 --> 04:20:47.048
when he went unconscious, or would it still be out?

5849
04:20:47.048 --> 04:20:49.482
MATT: No, the sword's still out there.

5850
04:20:49.482 --> 04:20:50.315
ASHLEY: Okay.

5851
04:20:50.315 --> 04:20:52.357
TALIESIN: The yell was, "Fjord."

5852
04:20:52.357 --> 04:20:54.497
ASHLEY: So as soon as I get up there, I see Fjord laying

5853
04:20:54.497 --> 04:20:57.758
on the ground, I unleash a battle cry.

5854
04:20:57.758 --> 04:20:58.591
So

5855
04:21:01.435 --> 04:21:04.333
"within 60 feet who can hear you

5856
04:21:04.333 --> 04:21:06.582
"gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws."

5857
04:21:06.582 --> 04:21:08.795
MARISHA: Yes! Yes!

5858
04:21:08.795 --> 04:21:11.137
ASHLEY: And I will attack

5859
04:21:12.575 --> 04:21:13.417
this guy in front of me.

5860
04:21:13.417 --> 04:21:15.440
MATT: Go for it. So you have advantage attack rolls.

5861
04:21:15.440 --> 04:21:16.989
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: And you have advantage on--

5862
04:21:16.989 --> 04:21:19.314
and you and Orly both have advantage on saving throws.

5863
04:21:19.314 --> 04:21:20.647
TRAVIS: Does that apply to an unconscious person?

5864
04:21:20.647 --> 04:21:21.898
SAM: No, you can't hear.

5865
04:21:21.898 --> 04:21:24.551
MAYY: Hmm? I'd say probably, no.

5866
04:21:24.551 --> 04:21:26.390
Battle Cry doesn't effect you when you're unconscious.

5867
04:21:26.390 --> 04:21:27.572
ASHLEY: 18.

5868
04:21:27.572 --> 04:21:29.264
MATT: 18 hits.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5869
04:21:30.749 --> 04:21:33.328
Aw shit, that doesn't work because you can't hear it.

5870
04:21:33.328 --> 04:21:34.853
Sorry, panic.

5871
04:21:34.853 --> 04:21:37.887
MARISHA: Good [inaudible], though.
TALIESIN: Good thought, good thought.

5872
04:21:37.887 --> 04:21:39.765
SAM: You think we heard you downstairs?
ASHLEY: Savage Attack.

5873
04:21:39.765 --> 04:21:41.387
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

5874
04:21:41.387 --> 04:21:42.554
ASHLEY: Much better.

5875
04:21:45.995 --> 04:21:47.709
26 points of damage.

5876
04:21:47.709 --> 04:21:50.244
MATT: 26 points of damage.
All right, so that was two attacks?

5877
04:21:50.244 --> 04:21:51.960
ASHLEY: That was one attack.
MATT: One attack. Nice.

5878
04:21:51.960 --> 04:21:52.903
ASHLEY: Second attack.

5879
04:21:52.903 --> 04:21:57.106
MATT: All right, the first attack breaks the
Charm Person that Orly had cast on it.

5880
04:21:57.106 --> 04:21:58.525
ASHLEY: Oh shit, he was charmed.

5881
04:21:58.525 --> 04:21:59.608
LAURA: You wouldn't have known that.

5882
04:21:59.608 --> 04:22:01.058
ASHLEY: I wouldn't have known that.

5883
04:22:01.058 --> 04:22:03.745
MATT: You do, however, as you strike with a melee attack,

5884
04:22:03.745 --> 04:22:05.336
the quills on its back

5885
04:22:05.336 --> 04:22:07.793
deals five points of piercing damage to you, reduced to two.

5886
04:22:07.793 --> 04:22:09.785
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Go ahead and make your second attack.

5887
04:22:13.895 --> 04:22:14.987
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

5888
04:22:14.987 --> 04:22:16.420
MATT: Woo!

5889
04:22:16.420 --> 04:22:17.259
TRAVIS: Yo.

5890
04:22:17.259 --> 04:22:18.092
MATT: Oh!

5891
04:22:19.816 --> 04:22:21.086
MARISHA: Isn't going to matter.

5892
04:22:21.086 --> 04:22:21.919
ASHLEY: Five.

5893
04:22:23.256 --> 04:22:24.247
Ten.

5894
04:22:24.247 --> 04:22:26.430
18 points of damage.

5895
04:22:26.430 --> 04:22:27.752
TRAVIS: And roll the extra.

5896
04:22:27.752 --> 04:22:29.127
MATT: That's with the dice doubled, right?

5897
04:22:29.127 --> 04:22:29.960
ASHLEY: That was the dice doubled.

5898
04:22:29.960 --> 04:22:33.873
MATT: And then roll your Brutal Critical, the additional d6.

5899
04:22:33.873 --> 04:22:36.979
ASHLEY: Additional d6, okay, okay. Plus four.

5900
04:22:36.979 --> 04:22:37.821
MATT: So 20?

5901
04:22:37.821 --> 04:22:39.016
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

5902
04:22:39.016 --> 04:22:40.824
ASHLEY: No.
TALIESIN: 22.

5903
04:22:40.824 --> 04:22:43.348
ASHLEY: 22, yeah, because it was 18.

5904
04:22:43.348 --> 04:22:45.660
MATT: Oh, sorry, the other was-- yeah, so 22.

5905
04:22:45.660 --> 04:22:47.790
He's really hurt. You do take another two points

5906
04:22:47.790 --> 04:22:50.053
of piercing damage. It was five, but reduced

5907
04:22:50.053 --> 04:22:52.133
from the quills as you strike with each melee attack.

5908
04:22:52.133 --> 04:22:53.917
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: And it spins on you (heavy breathing).

5909
04:22:53.917 --> 04:22:55.292
In your direction.

5910
04:22:55.292 --> 04:22:56.883
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right.

5911
04:22:56.883 --> 04:22:58.872
That finishes your turn, Yasha?

5912
04:22:58.872 --> 04:23:02.396
ASHLEY: (sighs) Yes.

5913
04:23:02.396 --> 04:23:03.229
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yes.

5914
04:23:04.183 --> 04:23:06.297
MATT: All right. It is now the sea spawns' turn.

5915
04:23:06.297 --> 04:23:08.225
As the guy was looking over the edge on his turn

5916
04:23:08.225 --> 04:23:10.742
off to the side of the ship.

5917
04:23:10.742 --> 04:23:12.487
TALIESIN: Just keep everyone okay for one more round.

5918
04:23:12.487 --> 04:23:15.816
TRAVIS: I'm incapacitated, so that
Hexblade's Curse goes away.

5919
04:23:15.816 --> 04:23:16.736
MATT: Gotcha.

5920
04:23:16.736 --> 04:23:19.886
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.
ASHLEY: Fucking-- another [inaudible].

5921
04:23:19.886 --> 04:23:21.890
TALIESIN: All I need is just--

5922
04:23:21.890 --> 04:23:22.723
I can do this.

5923
04:23:23.757 --> 04:23:24.707
SAM: What is that thing? More?!

5924
04:23:24.707 --> 04:23:26.827
MATT: Two of them climb back up on the edge of the ship.

5925
04:23:26.827 --> 04:23:28.268
That's what he was looking at off the side.

5926
04:23:28.268 --> 04:23:29.184
LAURA: What?
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

5927
04:23:29.184 --> 04:23:31.317
LAURA: Asshole.
LIAM: This is hot.

5928
04:23:31.317 --> 04:23:33.266
MATT: This guy's getting up there.
LIAM: It's so good.

5929
04:23:33.266 --> 04:23:34.799
MATT: And this guy's going to dart over

5930
04:23:34.799 --> 04:23:37.250
towards Yasha.

5931
04:23:37.250 --> 04:23:38.570
ASHLEY: Are they just going to keep coming?

5932
04:23:38.570 --> 04:23:40.398
LAURA: (uncertain sound)
TALIESIN: I don't know.

5933
04:23:41.306 --> 04:23:42.509
MATT: The one against you, Beauregard.

5934
04:23:42.509 --> 04:23:45.309
MARISHA: Kill these head-- yep.

5935
04:23:45.309 --> 04:23:47.350
MATT: That's going to be an 18.

5936
04:23:47.350 --> 04:23:49.225
MARISHA: Miss.
LIAM: I think it's dickheads.

5937
04:23:49.225 --> 04:23:50.077
MATT: 14.

5938
04:23:50.077 --> 04:23:51.102
MARISHA: Miss.

5939
04:23:51.102 --> 04:23:53.829
MATT: And with its quills-- you're immune to it.

5940
04:23:53.829 --> 04:23:55.560
(laughs)
MARISHA: Yeah.

5941
04:23:55.560 --> 04:23:59.950
MATT: Against you, Yasha, It's going to be an attack.

5942
04:23:59.950 --> 04:24:01.225
17.
ASHLEY: Yep.

5943
04:24:03.098 --> 04:24:04.873
MATT: 11.
ASHLEY: Nope.

5944
04:24:04.873 --> 04:24:06.423
MATT: And with its tentacle.

5945
04:24:06.423 --> 04:24:08.273
It's 22.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5946
04:24:08.273 --> 04:24:09.770
MATT: Okay, so you take--

5947
04:24:09.770 --> 04:24:11.553
MARISHA: "Yep. Nope. Okay."

5948
04:24:11.553 --> 04:24:14.068
MATT: Six-- three points of bludgeoning damage.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5949
04:24:14.068 --> 04:24:16.460
MATT: And then from the tentacle,

5950
04:24:17.725 --> 04:24:19.642
which does grapple you,

5951
04:24:20.660 --> 04:24:25.291
oof, you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage,
reduced to seven,

5952
04:24:25.291 --> 04:24:26.683
and you are grappled by that guy.

5953
04:24:26.683 --> 04:24:27.849
TALIESIN: Goddamn it, I just have to get up there.

5954
04:24:27.849 --> 04:24:29.757
I just have to get up there. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

5955
04:24:29.757 --> 04:24:31.524
MATT: The guy you had just attacked, who's really hurt,

5956
04:24:31.524 --> 04:24:34.227
turns around and is going to attempt strike at you as well.

5957
04:24:34.227 --> 04:24:35.110
ASHLEY: Okay.

5958
04:24:35.110 --> 04:24:35.943
MATT: That is

5959
04:24:37.868 --> 04:24:39.352
15. So that's a miss.

5960
04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:43.300
18, that's a hit. And with the tentacle.

5961
04:24:43.300 --> 04:24:44.133
Oof!

5962
04:24:44.133 --> 04:24:45.982
It's another 24.

5963
04:24:45.982 --> 04:24:49.457
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right, so you take

5964
04:24:50.670 --> 04:24:52.973
10, five points of bludgeoning damage.

5965
04:24:52.973 --> 04:24:54.690
Then from the other tentacle,

5966
04:24:54.690 --> 04:24:56.290
that's going to be 11 points,

5967
04:24:56.290 --> 04:24:59.940
so another five points of bludgeoning damage.

5968
04:24:59.940 --> 04:25:02.762
The one over there that's with Marius is going to go ahead

5969
04:25:02.762 --> 04:25:05.523
and attack him three times.

5970
04:25:05.523 --> 04:25:06.606
That's a miss.

5971
04:25:07.740 --> 04:25:09.978
Wow, a miss. Marius is being all dodgy suddenly.

5972
04:25:09.978 --> 04:25:11.917
SAM: Yeah! He's inspired by Beau's--

5973
04:25:11.917 --> 04:25:14.674
MATT: And miss! I rolled a three, and a four, then a four.

5974
04:25:14.674 --> 04:25:17.775
Marius is like, "Try me, bitch!"

5975
04:25:17.775 --> 04:25:19.782
No impact there.

5976
04:25:19.782 --> 04:25:22.715
All right, and the one down there that is currently

5977
04:25:22.715 --> 04:25:26.865
in base to base with you guys is going to go ahead and--

5978
04:25:28.593 --> 04:25:30.860
you're the one on the ground still,
so it's going to go after--

5979
04:25:30.860 --> 04:25:32.118
TALIESIN: Takes damage at the start of its turn.

5980
04:25:32.118 --> 04:25:35.477
MATT: That's true, yes, you're right. So the save is--

5981
04:25:37.062 --> 04:25:39.012
That's a failure on the save.

5982
04:25:39.012 --> 04:25:44.012
TALIESIN: That's, let's see, 12.
14 points of radiant damage.

5983
04:25:44.073 --> 04:25:45.832
MATT: 14 points of radiant damage.
SAM: Has that guy been damaged yet?

5984
04:25:45.832 --> 04:25:48.249
LAURA: Yeah, he went through Blade Barrier, so.

5985
04:25:48.249 --> 04:25:49.770
MATT: Yeah. That'll do it.

5986
04:25:49.770 --> 04:25:51.486
(cheering)

5987
04:25:51.486 --> 04:25:54.948
So it doesn't even attack. It goes turns towards Jester,

5988
04:25:54.948 --> 04:25:57.690
and as it does, the beetles swarm over it.

5989
04:25:57.690 --> 04:26:00.235
You hear the (buzzing) and then as the beetles scatter away,

5990
04:26:00.235 --> 04:26:04.003
you see the dull bones beneath
that are bendy and cartilage-like.

5991
04:26:04.003 --> 04:26:05.828
LAURA: ♪ I like the beetles! ♪

5992
04:26:05.828 --> 04:26:07.111
TRAVIS: Like a bone processor.

5993
04:26:07.111 --> 04:26:07.944
MATT: Yeah.

5994
04:26:08.872 --> 04:26:12.995
All righty, that finishes their turn.

5995
04:26:12.995 --> 04:26:14.678
Caleb, you're up.

5996
04:26:14.678 --> 04:26:16.670
LIAM: Caleb looks down the entire length of the boat

5997
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:19.615
and this is terrible. He pulls out a raven's feather

5998
04:26:19.615 --> 04:26:22.455
and waves his hand in the air and casts Fly on himself.

5999
04:26:22.455 --> 04:26:23.288
MATT: Okay.

6000
04:26:23.288 --> 04:26:26.310
LIAM: And he is going to move quickly up this way

6001
04:26:26.310 --> 04:26:30.017
and out one of the same holes that the sea spawn came in.

6002
04:26:30.017 --> 04:26:30.934
SAM: Snea snawn.

6003
04:26:30.934 --> 04:26:32.617
LIAM: And--
MATT: Five--

6004
04:26:32.617 --> 04:26:34.080
TALIESIN: There's a knife wall there.

6005
04:26:34.080 --> 04:26:35.601
LIAM: No, I thought it dropped.

6006
04:26:35.601 --> 04:26:36.498
TALIESIN: Not yet.

6007
04:26:36.498 --> 04:26:38.728
LAURA: It's going to drop on my turn.

6008
04:26:38.728 --> 04:26:41.833
MATT: Correct, so you have to go out this way.

6009
04:26:41.833 --> 04:26:43.423
If you want to.

6010
04:26:43.423 --> 04:26:46.481
I will say, make a

6011
04:26:46.481 --> 04:26:47.984
general strength check for me.

6012
04:26:47.984 --> 04:26:48.817
LIAM: Strength check.

6013
04:26:50.896 --> 04:26:52.566
It is a--

6014
04:26:52.566 --> 04:26:53.832
12.
MATT: Okay.

6015
04:26:53.832 --> 04:26:58.120
So yeah. You get just outside of that gun porthole there.

6016
04:26:58.120 --> 04:27:00.347
LIAM: That's as far as I can go?
I can't get up and see deck?

6017
04:27:00.347 --> 04:27:01.813
MATT: What's your fly feet?
LIAM: 60 feet.

6018
04:27:01.813 --> 04:27:03.977
MATT: Oh, 60. Okay, sorry, I thought that was 30.

6019
04:27:03.977 --> 04:27:06.677
So then that'll get you

6020
04:27:07.801 --> 04:27:08.634
I'd say.

6021
04:27:09.622 --> 04:27:11.439
SAM: Snea snong.

6022
04:27:13.430 --> 04:27:14.510
Yeah.

6023
04:27:14.510 --> 04:27:15.867
MATT: Right there.
SAM: There's the boy.

6024
04:27:15.867 --> 04:27:17.680
TRAVIS: That's a flying wizard.

6025
04:27:17.680 --> 04:27:19.813
LIAM: Move there as equally, or--

6026
04:27:19.813 --> 04:27:22.099
MATT: Yeah, that's fine, I think.

6027
04:27:22.099 --> 04:27:23.295
LIAM: That's it. It's the end of my turn.

6028
04:27:23.295 --> 04:27:24.895
MATT: All right.

6029
04:27:24.895 --> 04:27:28.103
MARISHA: Just Doctor Strange-ing.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6030
04:27:28.103 --> 04:27:29.360
LAURA: With this dramatic music.

6031
04:27:29.360 --> 04:27:30.193
MARISHA: Yeah.

6032
04:27:31.168 --> 04:27:32.649
TALIESIN: ♪ La la! ♪

6033
04:27:32.649 --> 04:27:35.232
(laughter)

6034
04:27:35.232 --> 04:27:36.619
MATT: That brings us to

6035
04:27:38.160 --> 04:27:39.426
this fella's turn.

6036
04:27:39.426 --> 04:27:40.701
SAM: Ew.
LAURA: Oh no.

6037
04:27:40.701 --> 04:27:42.859
MATT: He is going to go ahead and--

6038
04:27:42.859 --> 04:27:44.833
you watch his jaws (fluttering)

6039
04:27:44.833 --> 04:27:46.146
LAURA: Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. No!

6040
04:27:46.146 --> 04:27:47.377
MATT: (screeches)

6041
04:27:47.377 --> 04:27:49.802
He screeches out because he hasn't done it yet.

6042
04:27:49.802 --> 04:27:50.769
I need everybody to go ahead

6043
04:27:50.769 --> 04:27:53.228
and make a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

6044
04:27:54.095 --> 04:27:57.075
SAM: What happens if you get stunned when you're flying?

6045
04:27:57.075 --> 04:27:58.005
LIAM: Drop in the ocean.

6046
04:27:58.005 --> 04:27:59.105
SAM: Oh Jesus!

6047
04:27:59.105 --> 04:28:00.463
Maybe? No?

6048
04:28:01.527 --> 04:28:03.402
Oh, fuck this.

because of Battle Cry, right?

ASHLEY: Good call.

MATT: The two other crew. We have Shelda...

6074
04:28:45.765 --> 04:28:49.850
Fails. Shelda is stunned down below deck.

6075

SAM: That's stunned.

6078
04:28:57.441 --> 04:28:59.103
What can you do when you're stunned?
MATT: Finishing that.

6079
04:28:59.103 --> 04:29:02.003
MARISHA: You can't do shit when you're stunned.
You're just stunned.

6080
04:29:02.003 --> 04:29:07.003
SAM: "Incapacitated. You can't move,
you can speak falteringly."

6081
04:29:07.455 --> 04:29:10.368
MATT: And is going to go ahead and move.

6082
04:29:10.368 --> 04:29:14.292
MARISHA: People have advantage on you when they attack.

6083
04:29:14.292 --> 04:29:18.720
MATT: 25, I'll say, to get up there. Goes past stunned Beau,

6084
04:29:18.720 --> 04:29:21.670
like, darts and clambers over the edge of the ship to

6085
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:24.210
get back up on the back deck there.

6086
04:29:24.210 --> 04:29:27.943
All right, that finishes his go.

6087
04:29:27.943 --> 04:29:29.248
Caduceus and Veth.

6088
04:29:29.248 --> 04:29:31.664
Veth, you are stunned. Caduceus.
SAM: Can't do shit.

6089

TALIESIN: I'm going to take my full movement to get up.

6090
04:29:34.195 --> 04:29:37.897
Are there two-- full movement to get up.

6091

6092
04:29:42.048 --> 04:29:42.881
30.

6093
04:29:44.225 --> 04:29:46.197
You can't get out because Yasha.

6094
04:29:46.197 --> 04:29:47.155
TALIESIN: Double my move now.

6095
04:29:47.155 --> 04:29:49.540
LAURA: But you can go out that one.

6096
04:29:49.540 --> 04:29:51.437
TALIESIN: Are there two stairs?
LAURA: There's two stairs.

6097
04:29:51.437 --> 04:29:53.845
MATT: Oh, that's true. So instead, we can go--

6098
04:29:53.845 --> 04:29:54.985
TALIESIN: Okay.

6099
04:29:54.985 --> 04:29:56.187
MATT: Well, no, this goes below deck.

6100
04:29:56.187 --> 04:29:58.437
LAURA: Oh, I thought they both went up.

6101
04:29:58.437 --> 04:30:00.009
MATT: Yasha is right there in the way.

6102
04:30:00.009 --> 04:30:02.520
And, you know what? I'll say you can pass through,

6103
04:30:02.520 --> 04:30:04.390
if you want to, and come out on this side.

6104
04:30:04.390 --> 04:30:05.320
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay.

6105
04:30:05.320 --> 04:30:08.995
Do I still have-- I'm going to--

6106
04:30:08.995 --> 04:30:11.250
can I see everybody?

6107
04:30:11.250 --> 04:30:12.508
MATT: You can see...

6108
04:30:15.305 --> 04:30:16.722
You can see most everybody.

6109
04:30:17.688 --> 04:30:19.494
TALIESIN: Okay, um...

6110
04:30:19.494 --> 04:30:21.630
LAURA: Save the day, Caduceus!
Save the day, Caduceus!

6111
04:30:21.630 --> 04:30:24.530
TALIESIN: I was trying to figure out--
everyone's within, like, 60 feet right?

6112
04:30:24.530 --> 04:30:25.363
MATT: Yeah.

6113
04:30:25.363 --> 04:30:28.020
TALIESIN: Okay and I can see even
the unconscious people from where I am?

6114
04:30:28.020 --> 04:30:29.976
MATT: You can. You had to use your
action to get up here, by the way.

6115
04:30:29.976 --> 04:30:31.520
TALIESIN: I know.

6116
04:30:31.520 --> 04:30:33.386
Is that my full movement or--?

6117
04:30:35.637 --> 04:30:37.287
MATT: I'll say you can probably get--

6118
04:30:37.287 --> 04:30:38.685
TALIESIN: Just so I can just really--

6119
04:30:38.685 --> 04:30:42.730
All right, I'm going to
cast as my bonus action.

6120
04:30:42.730 --> 04:30:44.013
Watch this shit.

6121
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:47.920
Where did my bonus action go?

6122
04:30:47.920 --> 04:30:49.587
I'm too far, hold on.

6123
04:30:51.350 --> 04:30:52.365
Not Healing Word--

6124
04:30:52.365 --> 04:30:55.931
MATT: Actually as a point, because you
did move into Yasha's space in this way,

6125
04:30:55.931 --> 04:30:58.860
that guy does get an attack of opportunity against you.

6126
04:30:58.860 --> 04:31:00.427
TALIESIN: Oh, what, because I moved into the space?

6127
04:31:00.427 --> 04:31:03.877
MATT: Because you moved through
Yasha's space to get through there.

6128
04:31:05.658 --> 04:31:07.808
So, he would get an attack on you.

6129
04:31:08.930 --> 04:31:11.214
That is a 21 to hit.
TALIESIN: That hits.

6130
04:31:12.207 --> 04:31:13.323
MATT: You take...

6131
04:31:20.433 --> 04:31:23.967
That would be nine points of bludgeoning damage

6132
04:31:23.967 --> 04:31:25.690
and you are grappled.
MARISHA: Are you breaking the fourth wall?

6133
04:31:25.690 --> 04:31:28.590
TALIESIN: I can still cast and do shit like that?

6134
04:31:28.590 --> 04:31:29.898
LAURA: Yeah. You can still cast--

6135
04:31:29.898 --> 04:31:31.900
MATT: You can still cast, but grappling

6136
04:31:31.900 --> 04:31:34.150
gets a little weird here. This is a problem.

6137
04:31:34.150 --> 04:31:36.753
You moved out of the space--
TALIESIN: Oh, if I didn't move--

6138
04:31:36.753 --> 04:31:38.340
I mean, he would have stopped
me from moving any further

6139
04:31:38.340 --> 04:31:39.740
than where I am so I'm still--

6140
04:31:39.740 --> 04:31:41.523
MATT: Well, no, because you would have--

6141
04:31:41.523 --> 04:31:43.639
as soon as you left he would
have triggered the attack.

6142
04:31:43.639 --> 04:31:44.820
Which would have kept you in that space,

6143
04:31:44.820 --> 04:31:46.620
but Yasha's already occupying it.

6144
04:31:46.620 --> 04:31:48.754
TALIESIN: Oh, then--
LAURA: You'd be, like, up against Yasha.

6145
04:31:48.754 --> 04:31:51.100
MATT: So you'd be, like, back in the hallway

6146
04:31:51.100 --> 04:31:53.108
like right behind Yasha.

6147
04:31:56.130 --> 04:31:57.530
'Cause to be grappled you have to be--

6148
04:31:57.530 --> 04:32:01.010
TALIESIN: Can I see the deck from where I am?

6149
04:32:01.010 --> 04:32:02.559
MATT: From where you are, you can see the deck.

6150
04:32:02.559 --> 04:32:05.768
You would be potentially right
here, right behind Yasha--

6151
04:32:05.768 --> 04:32:08.194
TALIESIN: Cool, so can I see Orly?

6152
04:32:08.194 --> 04:32:10.254
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Can I see Fjord?

6153
04:32:10.254 --> 04:32:12.590
MATT: No, because you're still below deck.
SAM: Goddamn it.

6154
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:14.190
TALIESIN: I'm not level enough?

6155
04:32:14.190 --> 04:32:16.117
LAURA: Like his head is not above--

6156
04:32:16.117 --> 04:32:18.542
MATT: Your head is up, but right now--
TALIESIN: I am tall.

6157
04:32:18.542 --> 04:32:20.317
MATT: You are pretty tall.

6158
04:32:22.660 --> 04:32:26.163
It's finicky based on that this is in the way, technically,

6159
04:32:26.163 --> 04:32:28.770
of the space and you're in the stairs

6160
04:32:28.770 --> 04:32:30.502
behind Yasha and this other guy there.

6161
04:32:30.502 --> 04:32:33.045
I'll say roll a perception check with disadvantage.

6162
04:32:33.045 --> 04:32:33.878
TALIESIN: That's fair.

6163
04:32:33.878 --> 04:32:36.453
MATT: We'll go with this to see.

6164
04:32:37.600 --> 04:32:38.910
TALIESIN: That's 19.

6165
04:32:38.910 --> 04:32:39.743
MATT: 19.

6166
04:32:39.743 --> 04:32:42.274
Yeah, I'll say you can see him.

6167
04:32:42.274 --> 04:32:45.547
TRAVIS: Oh, man.
MATT: So yeah. I'll say you can--

6168
04:32:45.547 --> 04:32:47.222
You cannot see Orly, but you can see Fjord.

6169
04:32:47.222 --> 04:32:50.463
TALIESIN: And I'm rolling my--
do I roll my constitution save

6170
04:32:50.463 --> 04:32:52.928
for my concentration spell now or later?

6171
04:32:52.928 --> 04:32:54.261
MATT: You do.
MARISHA: You get advantage.

6172
04:32:54.261 --> 04:32:55.169
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6173
04:32:56.112 --> 04:32:57.656
TALIESIN: That's...

6174
04:32:57.656 --> 04:33:00.101
17.
MATT: 17, okay.

6175
04:33:00.101 --> 04:33:01.480
TALIESIN: And now--
MATT: Technically--

6176
04:33:01.480 --> 04:33:04.479
MATT: That's where it's--
TALIESIN: Yep, that's fine.

6177
04:33:04.479 --> 04:33:07.330
Now I'm going to cast as my bonus action...

6178
04:33:07.330 --> 04:33:09.188
Lord, where is it, where is it?

6179
04:33:11.230 --> 04:33:12.730
Mass Healing Word?

6180
04:33:14.000 --> 04:33:15.434
MATT: Mass Healing Word, nice.

6181
04:33:15.434 --> 04:33:17.855
TALIESIN: Mass Healing Word at level four.
MATT: Okay.

6182
04:33:17.855 --> 04:33:21.680
TALIESIN: So every friendly within 60 feet

6183
04:33:21.680 --> 04:33:24.863
who I can see-- hold on,

6184
04:33:27.518 --> 04:33:29.151
gets--

6185
04:33:29.151 --> 04:33:31.751
if you're unconscious, wait.
SAM: Wait, you can see?

6186
04:33:31.751 --> 04:33:33.910
TALIESIN: Everybody within 60 feet that I can see.

6187
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:36.699
LAURA: But you can see Veth, too, right?

6188
04:33:36.699 --> 04:33:37.532
TALIESIN: No.
MATT: No.

6189
04:33:37.532 --> 04:33:39.610
TALIESIN: Just above deck.

6190
04:33:39.610 --> 04:33:41.900
Six-- gets 11 hit points.

6191
04:33:41.900 --> 04:33:43.480
MATT: So 11 points to you, Fjord.

6192
04:33:43.480 --> 04:33:45.410
TALIESIN: No, Fjord, because he's unconscious--

6193
04:33:45.410 --> 04:33:47.400
MATT: Oh, that's right.
TALIESIN: Gets 13.

6194
04:33:47.400 --> 04:33:48.785
MATT: Right, it's max'ed.

6195
04:33:48.785 --> 04:33:50.470
TALIESIN: And Orly also gets 13.

6196
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:52.762
MATT: That's true.
SAM: Orly!

6197
04:33:52.762 --> 04:33:54.195
ASHLEY: Yes.
TRAVIS: Thank you very much.

6198
04:33:54.195 --> 04:33:56.980
TALIESIN: And Caleb's gets--
LIAM: I'm at full.

6199
04:33:56.980 --> 04:33:58.060
MATT: All right
LIAM: But thank you.

6200
04:33:58.060 --> 04:33:59.928
TALIESIN: Fuck my life.

6201
04:33:59.928 --> 04:34:01.770
TRAVIS: Thank you very much.
ASHLEY: That was awesome.

6202
04:34:01.770 --> 04:34:04.778
MATT: That was that was some
finicky stuff and you did well.

6203
04:34:04.778 --> 04:34:05.986
That was great.

6204
04:34:05.986 --> 04:34:09.686
All righty. Finishing Caduceus' turn. Veth, you're stunned.

6205
04:34:09.686 --> 04:34:12.003
SAM: Yep.
MATT: The crew.

6206
04:34:12.003 --> 04:34:14.052
Stunned. He's going to go ahead and move.

6207
04:34:14.052 --> 04:34:16.516
SAM: "What's going on upstairs?"

6208
04:34:16.516 --> 04:34:18.436
MATT: 30, "what the fuck?"

6209
04:34:18.436 --> 04:34:20.338
SAM: "Oh god, there's blades all over my face!"

6210
04:34:20.338 --> 04:34:21.771
MATT: "What the fuck?! What? Jesus Christ!"

6211
04:34:21.771 --> 04:34:23.308
LAURA: I did it out of (mumbles).

6212
04:34:23.308 --> 04:34:24.876
I avoided the stairs.

6213
04:34:24.876 --> 04:34:26.479
MATT: I would s--

6214
04:34:26.479 --> 04:34:27.737
SAM: Take them down.

6215
04:34:28.812 --> 04:34:30.294
LAURA: No, god! Gallan, Caleb, and Jester--

6216
04:34:30.294 --> 04:34:34.544
MATT: No, Gallan rolled high enough to where he was like,

6217
04:34:34.544 --> 04:34:35.860
"Shit!"

6218
04:34:35.860 --> 04:34:39.795
Didn't get an a bunch more axe wounds to the face.

6219
04:34:39.795 --> 04:34:40.886
That's the end of his turn now.

6220
04:34:40.886 --> 04:34:42.915
All right, Jester, you're up.

6221
04:34:42.915 --> 04:34:45.465
LAURA: I can't get upstairs
because everybody's blocking everything.

6222
04:34:45.465 --> 04:34:47.468
MATT: Yep.
TALIESIN: Hmm.

6223
04:34:47.468 --> 04:34:49.231
LAURA: This is stupid.
TALIESIN: Sorry.

6224
04:34:49.231 --> 04:34:50.064
MATT: It's a traffic jam.

6225
04:34:50.064 --> 04:34:50.978
ASHLEY: Sorry.

6226
04:34:50.978 --> 04:34:52.613
LAURA: I know, but it's going to use up all my--

6227
04:34:52.613 --> 04:34:54.480
it's an action to do it.

6228
04:34:56.795 --> 04:34:58.885
I'm going to drop Blade Barrier,

6229
04:34:58.885 --> 04:35:00.676
so I don't set off any sparks.

6230
04:35:00.676 --> 04:35:02.719
MATT: All right.
SAM: Except for the--

6231
04:35:02.719 --> 04:35:05.653
LAURA: -- the ones that I've been doing.

6232
04:35:05.653 --> 04:35:08.736
MATT: Thankfully, like, all the gun powder is here. (laughs)

6233
04:35:10.382 --> 04:35:11.215
LAURA: I'm going to--

6234
04:35:17.230 --> 04:35:18.645
I've got a question.

6235
04:35:18.645 --> 04:35:20.145
MATT: Yeah?
LAURA: With my

6236
04:35:21.498 --> 04:35:25.052
Spiritual Weapon, since it's not actually corporeal,

6237
04:35:25.052 --> 04:35:27.147
can I float it up and through the ceiling

6238
04:35:27.147 --> 04:35:28.268
with its 20 movement?

6239
04:35:28.268 --> 04:35:30.140
MATT: You still have to be able to see where it's going.

6240
04:35:30.140 --> 04:35:30.973
LAURA: Okay.

6241
04:35:32.290 --> 04:35:36.332
If I use my action to Dimension Door

6242
04:35:37.372 --> 04:35:38.763
MATT: Then I would allow you to move it up through the floor

6243
04:35:38.763 --> 04:35:40.704
because it is ethereal, or spiritual.

6244
04:35:40.704 --> 04:35:43.580
LAURA: Okay, then I'm use my action to Dimension Door.

6245
04:35:43.580 --> 04:35:44.413
MATT: Okay.

6246
04:35:45.406 --> 04:35:47.002
LAURA: I don't know what's going on above deck

6247
04:35:47.002 --> 04:35:50.702
so I'm going to bamf up to here.

6248
04:35:50.702 --> 04:35:53.165
MATT: (boof) All right.

6249
04:35:53.165 --> 04:35:54.432
LAURA: And then I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon.

6250
04:35:54.432 --> 04:35:56.662
I'm going to move it up through.

6251
04:35:56.662 --> 04:35:57.770
MATT: It comes up to about right

6252
04:35:57.770 --> 04:36:00.362
where Fjord is, as far as placement there.

6253
04:36:00.362 --> 04:36:02.836
SAM: It hits Fjord and kills him.
LAURA: Can it hit anything?

6254
04:36:02.836 --> 04:36:05.598
MATT: It can move over here and hit this guy, if you'd like.

6255
04:36:05.598 --> 04:36:07.052
LAURA: Okay, yeah.
MATT: With the last of its movement.

6256
04:36:07.052 --> 04:36:07.885
Go for it.

6257
04:36:09.970 --> 04:36:11.188
LAURA: That hits. 26.

6258
04:36:11.188 --> 04:36:12.563
MATT: 26. Yeah, it does.

6259
04:36:18.516 --> 04:36:20.593
LAURA: Ten, 15 points.

6260
04:36:20.593 --> 04:36:22.026
MATT: 15 points.

6261
04:36:22.026 --> 04:36:24.526
LAURA: Of serrated lollipop damage.

6262
04:36:25.853 --> 04:36:26.730
SAM: Ginsu lollipop.

6263
04:36:26.730 --> 04:36:30.072
MATT: Which it does. It shreds the creature.

6264
04:36:33.767 --> 04:36:34.600
LAURA: Okay.

6265
04:36:34.600 --> 04:36:37.342
TRAVIS: Is taking a health potion
an action or a bonus action?

6266
04:36:37.342 --> 04:36:40.384
MATT: We usually say consider it as

6267
04:36:40.384 --> 04:36:41.799
a bonus action to take it.

6268
04:36:45.425 --> 04:36:47.545
All right, that finish your turn?

6269
04:36:47.545 --> 04:36:48.926
All right, Jester's done.

6270
04:36:48.926 --> 04:36:49.776
Beau.

6271
04:36:49.776 --> 04:36:51.751
MARISHA: Stunned.
MATT: You're stunned. All right.

6272
04:36:51.751 --> 04:36:53.719
It is this guy's turn now.

6273
04:36:53.719 --> 04:36:54.891
SAM: It's just me and Shelda.

6274
04:36:54.891 --> 04:36:56.862
LIAM: Which one? Big bad?

6275
04:36:56.862 --> 04:36:58.692
MATT: The angry guy up there.

6276
04:36:58.692 --> 04:36:59.892
TRAVIS: This cat, right?

6277
04:36:59.892 --> 04:37:01.060
MATT: Yep.

6278
04:37:01.060 --> 04:37:03.193
He is very--

6279
04:37:05.217 --> 04:37:09.050
just going to leap down. Make an acrobatics check.

6280
04:37:09.050 --> 04:37:10.857
It's cocked.

6281
04:37:10.857 --> 04:37:12.190
Yeah, he's fine.

6282
04:37:13.923 --> 04:37:15.737
SAM: You want to seem cool, but it's like--

6283
04:37:15.737 --> 04:37:20.102
TRAVIS: Well, he just jumped down in the fracas.

6284
04:37:20.102 --> 04:37:22.128
MATT: Watching the healing spell go out there

6285
04:37:22.128 --> 04:37:24.350
and looking down at all of a sudden the rising center

6286
04:37:24.350 --> 04:37:27.680
just gets angry and just as opposed to, like,

6287
04:37:27.680 --> 04:37:29.022
staying in the back and watching from a distance,

6288
04:37:29.022 --> 04:37:31.105
pulls out the Sword of Fathoms, leaps down,

6289
04:37:31.105 --> 04:37:33.768
and walks right up to Fjord on the ground.

6290
04:37:33.768 --> 04:37:35.238
LAURA: Oh god!
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

6291
04:37:35.238 --> 04:37:36.071
MARISHA: No, come on.

6292
04:37:36.071 --> 04:37:38.571
MATT: Because you are

6293
04:37:38.571 --> 04:37:40.501
prone, it has advantage on the attacks.

6294
04:37:40.501 --> 04:37:42.231
SAM: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

6295
04:37:42.231 --> 04:37:44.255
MATT: So first.
SAM: You've got 13 hit points.

6296
04:37:44.255 --> 04:37:46.535
MATT: First, it's going to attempt to

6297
04:37:47.441 --> 04:37:48.441
to bite you.

6298
04:37:50.240 --> 04:37:51.553
That's a natural 20.

6299
04:37:51.553 --> 04:37:52.561
LAURA: Wait. He can bite--

6300
04:37:52.561 --> 04:37:55.027
He's biting you while you're on the ground?

6301
04:37:55.027 --> 04:37:57.732
That means he has to lean forward
with his mouth and be like--

6302
04:37:57.732 --> 04:37:58.677
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Very romantic.

6303
04:37:58.677 --> 04:38:01.260
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: How far is Fjord?

6304
04:38:01.260 --> 04:38:03.387
MATT: Fjord is about 25 feet from you.

6305
04:38:03.387 --> 04:38:05.720
TALIESIN: I'll cancel that just
for fucking shits and giggles.

6306
04:38:05.720 --> 04:38:06.561
MATT: Good on you.

6307
04:38:06.561 --> 04:38:09.067
MARISHA: (chanting) Grave cleric, grave cleric.

6308
04:38:09.067 --> 04:38:11.102
TALIESIN: It's not going to help
that much, but I don't know.

6309
04:38:11.102 --> 04:38:13.085
LAURA: It's something!

6310
04:38:13.085 --> 04:38:15.252
MATT: That's going to bring us to

6311
04:38:18.058 --> 04:38:19.280
nine points piercing damage.

6312
04:38:19.280 --> 04:38:21.690
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Hey! That's not bad.

6313
04:38:21.690 --> 04:38:24.507
MATT: Its first attack with the Sword of Fathoms

6314
04:38:24.507 --> 04:38:28.348
is going to be a 15 to hit.

6315
04:38:28.348 --> 04:38:29.181
TRAVIS: Hits.

6316
04:38:29.181 --> 04:38:30.948
LAURA: Why don't you have any armor on?

6317
04:38:30.948 --> 04:38:31.781
TALIESIN: He was asleep.
TRAVIS: He stabbed me

6318
04:38:31.781 --> 04:38:34.388
in the chest while I was sleeping.

6319
04:38:34.388 --> 04:38:36.102
LAURA: You didn't sleep with your armor on?

6320
04:38:36.102 --> 04:38:37.901
TRAVIS: I guess not.
LAURA: I always sleep with armor on.

6321
04:38:37.901 --> 04:38:39.005
MATT: Technically, you weren't sleeping armor on.

6322
04:38:39.005 --> 04:38:41.176
We totally forgot when we were calculating your armor stuff.

6323
04:38:41.176 --> 04:38:42.234
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: So, technically, you should've taken

6324
04:38:42.234 --> 04:38:43.430
a lot more damage,

6325
04:38:43.430 --> 04:38:45.155
but it's fine.

6326
04:38:45.155 --> 04:38:47.413
LAURA: I always sleep with armor on, so.

6327
04:38:47.413 --> 04:38:48.246
MATT: Okay. That means

6328
04:38:48.246 --> 04:38:50.263
you also wake up with exhaustion points every morning.

6329
04:38:50.263 --> 04:38:51.485
LAURA: Okay, I don't always don't do that.

6330
04:38:51.485 --> 04:38:53.040
MATT: I made some mistakes in there, I'm not

6331
04:38:53.040 --> 04:38:54.768
considering the fact that
all of you guys should have no armor on.

6332
04:38:54.768 --> 04:38:56.135
ASHLEY: It's a lot to manage.

6333
04:38:56.135 --> 04:38:59.527
MATT: That's my bad, but you know what, that's fine.

6334
04:38:59.527 --> 04:39:00.850
I'll just give myself a few more bonuses

6335
04:39:00.850 --> 04:39:02.158
here on their end even it out.

6336
04:39:02.158 --> 04:39:04.278
MARISHA: (unhappy laugh)
LAURA: (fake sobbing)

6337
04:39:04.278 --> 04:39:05.153
MATT: All right.

6338
04:39:05.153 --> 04:39:06.361
SAM: Ooh boy.

6339
04:39:06.361 --> 04:39:07.200
MATT: You take--

6340
04:39:07.200 --> 04:39:09.737
SAM: I'm unconscious just from dropping a bunch.

6341
04:39:09.737 --> 04:39:11.270
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage.

6342
04:39:11.270 --> 04:39:12.230
TRAVIS: I am unconscious.

6343
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:16.372
MATT: And four points psychic. You are unconscious.

6344
04:39:18.735 --> 04:39:20.175
Hits you with an auto-critical.

6345
04:39:20.175 --> 04:39:21.767
You immediately lose two death savings throws.

6346
04:39:21.767 --> 04:39:23.527
SAM: (groans)

6347
04:39:23.527 --> 04:39:24.928
TRAVIS: Two down.
MARISHA: So you only get that

6348
04:39:24.928 --> 04:39:26.703
Relentless Endurance thing once a day?

6349
04:39:26.703 --> 04:39:27.744
TRAVIS: Once a day.

6350
04:39:29.417 --> 04:39:32.035
MATT: All right, that finishes his turn.

6351
04:39:32.035 --> 04:39:34.607
You see as, like, it's jamming the blade into Fjord's chest,

6352
04:39:34.607 --> 04:39:36.503
as Fjord screams out and he goes unconscious

6353
04:39:36.503 --> 04:39:38.595
and is, like, digging into his sternum with the blade

6354
04:39:38.595 --> 04:39:40.970
like he's trying to carve a watermelon.

6355
04:39:40.970 --> 04:39:43.390
TRAVIS: Pulled out a health potion and I (gurgles)

6356
04:39:43.390 --> 04:39:45.044
It's just sitting in my hand.

6357
04:39:45.044 --> 04:39:48.581
MATT: All right. Fjord, it's your turn.

6358
04:39:48.581 --> 04:39:51.037
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: I need you to make a death throw for me.

6359
04:39:51.037 --> 04:39:52.860
MARISHA: Oh, this is it.

6360
04:39:52.860 --> 04:39:54.280
Oh, I hate this!

6361
04:39:54.280 --> 04:39:56.530
SAM: Yeah, this is, like, the worst.

6362
04:39:58.095 --> 04:39:59.128
TRAVIS: 11.

6363
04:39:59.128 --> 04:40:00.485
MATT: All right, that was a success.

6364
04:40:00.485 --> 04:40:05.468
(cheering)
That's a success.

6365
04:40:07.210 --> 04:40:09.519
Yasha, your turn.

6366
04:40:09.519 --> 04:40:12.097
ASHLEY: Too stressful! Okay.

6367
04:40:12.097 --> 04:40:13.498
MATT: You are grappled and you're in melee

6368
04:40:13.498 --> 04:40:14.378
with two of those guys.

6369
04:40:14.378 --> 04:40:17.508
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so porcupine guy.

6370
04:40:17.508 --> 04:40:20.178
Is he the one who was grappling me?

6371
04:40:20.178 --> 04:40:21.982
MATT: Technically, no, it's this guy here

6372
04:40:21.982 --> 04:40:23.625
that's grappling you in front of you.

6373
04:40:23.625 --> 04:40:27.933
ASHLEY: (growls) Okay, I will attack.

6374
04:40:30.761 --> 04:40:32.977
Can I try to get out of the grapple?

6375
04:40:32.977 --> 04:40:36.970
Porcupine guy has the tentacle, or they both do?

6376
04:40:36.970 --> 04:40:39.623
MATT: There's no porcupine guy here; they're both tentacle.

6377
04:40:39.623 --> 04:40:41.664
ASHLEY: They're both tentacle. Okay, got it.

6378
04:40:41.664 --> 04:40:44.164
So I will attack

6379
04:40:45.057 --> 04:40:47.328
the guy to the left first, I guess.

6380
04:40:47.328 --> 04:40:50.477
Or, well. You said the guy on the right is grappling me?

6381
04:40:50.477 --> 04:40:51.310
MATT: Mm-hmm.

6382
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:53.378
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to try to get out of that.

6383
04:40:53.378 --> 04:40:54.212
MATT: Yep, go for it.

6384
04:40:54.212 --> 04:40:55.045
ASHLEY: Okay.

6385
04:40:56.350 --> 04:40:57.675
This is an attack, or this is a--
TRAVIS: I feel like we're

6386
04:40:57.675 --> 04:40:59.710
burning a max amount of calories right now.

6387
04:40:59.710 --> 04:41:02.375
MATT: This is a-- well, are you trying to break out of it?

6388
04:41:02.375 --> 04:41:03.994
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Or are you trying to attack?

6389
04:41:03.994 --> 04:41:05.335
ASHLEY: I'll attack.
MATT: Up to you.

6390
04:41:05.335 --> 04:41:06.418
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll attack.

6391
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:10.104
That's cocked, but I forgot I was going to go reckless.

6392
04:41:10.104 --> 04:41:12.010
So just in case,

6393
04:41:12.010 --> 04:41:12.843
I'm glad I did that.

6394
04:41:12.843 --> 04:41:14.502
MATT: Okay, so you're going reckless.

6395
04:41:14.502 --> 04:41:17.333
ASHLEY: Ooh, both bad.

6396
04:41:17.333 --> 04:41:18.874
That was

6397
04:41:20.224 --> 04:41:21.407
well, 14.

6398
04:41:21.407 --> 04:41:23.742
MATT: Hits.
ASHLEY: Okay.

6399
04:41:23.742 --> 04:41:25.117
So first attack.

6400
04:41:28.666 --> 04:41:29.574
SAM: Oh boysie.

6401
04:41:29.574 --> 04:41:31.457
ASHLEY: Six, seven. Savage Attacker.

6402
04:41:31.457 --> 04:41:35.055
Can we get better? Yeah, that's better. Nine, ten.

6403
04:41:35.055 --> 04:41:37.888
20 points total for the first hit.

6404
04:41:38.817 --> 04:41:39.984
MATT: Mmkay.
ASHLEY: Okay.

6405
04:41:41.753 --> 04:41:43.461
Second hit.

6406
04:41:48.327 --> 04:41:49.795
That's good.

6407
04:41:49.795 --> 04:41:51.057
19.

6408
04:41:51.057 --> 04:41:52.026
MATT: 19 does hit.

6409
04:41:52.026 --> 04:41:52.864
ASHLEY: Okay.

6410
04:41:52.864 --> 04:41:54.272
LIAM: I'm checking line of sight.

6411
04:41:58.070 --> 04:42:00.068
ASHLEY: 15 points of damage.

6412
04:42:00.068 --> 04:42:01.618
MATT: 15, all right. He's looking hurt,

6413
04:42:01.618 --> 04:42:03.110
but he's still standing.

6414
04:42:04.183 --> 04:42:05.016
ASHLEY: Okay.

6415
04:42:05.016 --> 04:42:06.224
MATT: Is that your turn?

6416
04:42:06.224 --> 04:42:08.332
SAM: I don't want to get it back.

6417
04:42:08.332 --> 04:42:10.047
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

6418
04:42:10.047 --> 04:42:11.013
ASHLEY: That's my fucking turn.

6419
04:42:11.013 --> 04:42:12.998
MATT: Yasha's done. It's now--

6420
04:42:12.998 --> 04:42:15.764
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

6421
04:42:15.764 --> 04:42:17.197
I'm going to move a little bit.

6422
04:42:17.197 --> 04:42:18.654
MATT: You can't, you're grappled.

6423
04:42:18.654 --> 04:42:20.745
ASHLEY: I'm fucking grappled, goddamn it.

6424
04:42:20.745 --> 04:42:22.090
TALIESIN: Top of their turn, they take damage.

6425
04:42:22.090 --> 04:42:24.040
MATT: Yes, they do.

6426
04:42:24.040 --> 04:42:25.187
So go ahead and roll that.

6427
04:42:25.187 --> 04:42:26.903
TRAVIS: Choked myself to death.

6428
04:42:26.903 --> 04:42:29.386
MATT: Fail on his end and

6429
04:42:29.386 --> 04:42:30.357
both fail.

6430
04:42:30.357 --> 04:42:32.636
TALIESIN: Oh yeah! That's nice.

6431
04:42:32.636 --> 04:42:34.002
LIAM: (like the Kool-Aid Man) Oh yeah!

6432
04:42:36.782 --> 04:42:39.062
TALIESIN: Fuck, I can't count.

6433
04:42:39.062 --> 04:42:42.300
17. 21 points of radiant damage to everyone

6434
04:42:42.300 --> 04:42:43.771
in that fucking circle.

6435
04:42:43.771 --> 04:42:44.950
LAURA: That you choose.

6436
04:42:44.950 --> 04:42:47.918
TALIESIN: Yeah, except-- yeah, I'll do
21 points to anybody I don't like.

6437
04:42:47.918 --> 04:42:49.693
MATT: Both of them just, like, immediately

6438
04:42:49.693 --> 04:42:53.680
are lifted off their feet as the swarm of celestial beetles

6439
04:42:53.680 --> 04:42:55.180
just consumes them in the middle of the air,

6440
04:42:55.180 --> 04:42:58.305
leaving their weird, floppy,

6441
04:42:58.305 --> 04:43:01.721
cartilage-like skeletons to hit the ground.

6442
04:43:02.956 --> 04:43:03.789
SAM: Caduceus is killing it.

6443
04:43:03.789 --> 04:43:05.205
LAURA: Yeah, Caduceus is doing it.

6444
04:43:05.205 --> 04:43:07.602
MATT: You are no longer grappled.
TALIESIN: Nope.

6445
04:43:07.602 --> 04:43:09.658
LAURA: You're doing it Caduceus, you're doing it.

6446
04:43:09.658 --> 04:43:11.983
MATT: -- say that. You're safe.

6447
04:43:11.983 --> 04:43:14.581
LAURA: Oh my god, safe!

6448
04:43:15.917 --> 04:43:16.750
MATT: All righty.

6449
04:43:18.223 --> 04:43:23.048
This guy here is going to go ahead and leap past.

6450
04:43:23.048 --> 04:43:25.695
MARISHA: Man, being stunned sucks!

6451
04:43:25.695 --> 04:43:30.262
MATT: And is going to go ahead and attack Fjord.

6452
04:43:30.262 --> 04:43:33.746
SAM: Oh! Oh, but that's not good.

6453
04:43:33.746 --> 04:43:34.968
MATT: It's an auto-crit.

6454
04:43:34.968 --> 04:43:39.720
TRAVIS: Well, I only had one death save left, so yeah.

6455
04:43:39.720 --> 04:43:41.513
MATT: As creature has its blade in his chest,

6456
04:43:41.513 --> 04:43:44.229
staring off to the side, it gives a look towards

6457
04:43:44.229 --> 04:43:46.295
one of the spined guys who had climbed over the edge.

6458
04:43:46.295 --> 04:43:48.978
It leaps down onto the ground,

6459
04:43:48.978 --> 04:43:51.936
puts its hands on the blade, the Sword of Fathoms,

6460
04:43:51.936 --> 04:43:53.973
as well and pushes down.

6461
04:43:53.973 --> 04:43:58.799
As it stabs all the way through Fjord's chest,

6462
04:43:58.799 --> 04:44:00.402
(exhale)

6463
04:44:00.402 --> 04:44:02.735
the breath leaves his mouth.

6464
04:44:03.994 --> 04:44:04.827
TRAVIS: Whoops.

6465
04:44:09.250 --> 04:44:11.523
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: We got diamonds, right?

6466
04:44:11.523 --> 04:44:13.039
MARISHA: I think we have some.
SAM: Beauregard.

6467
04:44:13.039 --> 04:44:14.027
MATT: Caleb, it's your turn.

6468
04:44:14.027 --> 04:44:15.710
SAM: You just became the captain.

6469
04:44:15.710 --> 04:44:18.990
LIAM: Thinking about the conversation
I had with Fjord just yesterday,

6470
04:44:18.990 --> 04:44:21.310
I drag dust up my arm,

6471
04:44:21.310 --> 04:44:23.476
and point my hand at the head one

6472
04:44:23.476 --> 04:44:25.098
and cast Disintegrate.

6473
04:44:25.098 --> 04:44:27.062
MATT: Oh shit.

6474
04:44:27.062 --> 04:44:27.919
All righty.

6475
04:44:27.919 --> 04:44:31.828
LIAM: Two, four, six,

6476
04:44:31.828 --> 04:44:34.161
eight, ten.

6477
04:44:37.235 --> 04:44:39.660
TRAVIS: Like the ocean IRS, they're--

6478
04:44:41.220 --> 04:44:42.510
MATT: It's a dex saving throw for that?

6479
04:44:42.510 --> 04:44:43.559
LIAM: Three-- Yeah.

6480
04:44:43.559 --> 04:44:47.051
MARISHA: They will find you,
they will come collect from you.

6481
04:44:48.028 --> 04:44:49.636
LIAM: 67.

6482
04:44:50.732 --> 04:44:52.508
MATT: Oh, natural four, that's a fail.

6483
04:44:52.508 --> 04:44:54.533
LIAM: 67 points of damage.

6484
04:44:58.363 --> 04:44:59.583
TRAVIS: That's a lot.
MARISHA: Kill him.

6485
04:44:59.583 --> 04:45:02.863
MATT: All right. So as it blasts, the ice that's still

6486
04:45:02.863 --> 04:45:04.663
encasing its chest is scattered away

6487
04:45:04.663 --> 04:45:07.704
and you watch as the sickly green glow of the beam impacts

6488
04:45:07.704 --> 04:45:10.817
and watch as parts of its fleshy body begin to turn to dust.

6489
04:45:10.817 --> 04:45:14.290
(gasping) It backs away and it withdraws the blade from

6490
04:45:14.290 --> 04:45:16.037
the gaping wound in Fjord's chest.

6491
04:45:16.037 --> 04:45:18.993
It took some damage.

6492
04:45:18.993 --> 04:45:20.160
SAM: Not dead!

6493
04:45:21.215 --> 04:45:23.488
MATT: This guy's barely been hit this whole battle.

6494
04:45:23.488 --> 04:45:26.025
LIAM: And I would like to

6495
04:45:26.025 --> 04:45:26.858
hover

6496
04:45:30.316 --> 04:45:31.299
to here.

6497
04:45:31.299 --> 04:45:33.999
SAM: Are you super stunned still?

6498
04:45:33.999 --> 04:45:37.608
MARISHA: Until these guys' turns are over

6499
04:45:37.608 --> 04:45:39.689
because it ends on their turn.
LIAM: No, I will--

6500
04:45:39.689 --> 04:45:41.499
TRAVIS: (gasps)

6501
04:45:41.499 --> 04:45:45.150
In D&amp;D Beyond, it now says "Dead" next to my name.

6502
04:45:45.150 --> 04:45:46.650
MARISHA: Oh my god.
SAM: How did that happen?

6503
04:45:46.650 --> 04:45:48.907
TRAVIS: In parentheses, it says (Dead).

6504
04:45:48.907 --> 04:45:50.484
MARISHA: In front of it, so it's just, like, death.

6505
04:45:50.484 --> 04:45:51.317
SAM: Oh god.

6506
04:45:51.317 --> 04:45:52.150
TRAVIS: It's a look.

6507
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:54.424
SAM: Easy, easy, D&amp;D Beyond.

6508
04:45:54.424 --> 04:45:56.540
MARISHA: Dang. Brutal.

6509
04:45:56.540 --> 04:45:57.649
SAM: Take it easy, guys.

6510
04:45:57.649 --> 04:46:00.115
LAURA: Brutal.
MATT: There you go, Caleb.

6511
04:46:00.115 --> 04:46:03.727
LIAM: I missed one point. I missed a die.

6512
04:46:03.727 --> 04:46:04.819
MATT: Okay.

6513
04:46:04.819 --> 04:46:05.727
LIAM: Is he dead?

6514
04:46:05.727 --> 04:46:06.810
MATT: No.

6515
04:46:06.810 --> 04:46:10.502
One point. 53. Got it. All right, cool.

6516
04:46:10.502 --> 04:46:12.810
Finishing Caleb's turn, it's now this guy's turn.

6517
04:46:12.810 --> 04:46:13.645
The stun wears off.

6518
04:46:13.645 --> 04:46:14.503
SAM: (gasps)

6519
04:46:14.503 --> 04:46:16.536
Uk'oteauregard!

6520
04:46:16.536 --> 04:46:17.446
MATT: At the end of his turn, but just--

6521
04:46:17.446 --> 04:46:21.007
MARISHA: Just immediately start crying.

6522
04:46:21.007 --> 04:46:21.848
MATT: All right.

6523
04:46:21.848 --> 04:46:24.109
MARISHA: Stunned and couldn't do shit while my friend died.

6524
04:46:24.109 --> 04:46:26.417
LIAM: Sob fight, sob fight.
MARISHA: (sobbing)

6525
04:46:26.417 --> 04:46:28.940
MATT: This guy is going to leap down

6526
04:46:28.940 --> 04:46:33.007
and attempt to attack Orly three times.

6527
04:46:34.438 --> 04:46:36.721
MARISHA: Is still in my range?
TALIESIN: Orly didn't get his move--

6528
04:46:36.721 --> 04:46:37.954
didn't get his thing, did he?

6529
04:46:37.954 --> 04:46:39.091
MATT: No, not yet.

6530
04:46:39.091 --> 04:46:41.030
So it's going to take a sword attack.

6531
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:42.179
MARISHA: Is he in my range?

6532
04:46:42.179 --> 04:46:43.379
MATT: What's it? You're technically

6533
04:46:43.379 --> 04:46:45.045
still stunned until the end of his turn, I believe.

6534
04:46:45.045 --> 04:46:45.878
LAURA: Yeah.

6535
04:46:45.878 --> 04:46:47.670
MATT: Let me double check.

6536
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:49.358
"The end of its next turn." Yeah.

6537
04:46:50.850 --> 04:46:54.200
So it hits Orly with its sword for--

6538
04:46:55.386 --> 04:46:56.544
MARISHA: Fuck.

6539
04:46:59.813 --> 04:47:01.896
MATT: Well, Orly is unconscious.

6540
04:47:03.500 --> 04:47:06.130
And it has two more attacks.

6541
04:47:06.130 --> 04:47:08.513
MARISHA: Is he going to kill Orly, too?
MATT: That's a hit.

6542
04:47:11.980 --> 04:47:16.000
So after it slices Orly and Orly falls on the ground,

6543
04:47:16.000 --> 04:47:19.128
it jumps on top, takes the blade, and jams it from the side

6544
04:47:19.128 --> 04:47:23.310
of the shell through the armpit and inside Orly's torso.

6545
04:47:23.310 --> 04:47:24.835
He (gurgles).

6546
04:47:24.835 --> 04:47:27.586
And then twists on the inside and Orly just goes a limp.

6547
04:47:27.586 --> 04:47:29.919
(yelling and groaning)
TRAVIS: Holy fucking shit!

6548
04:47:29.919 --> 04:47:33.294
MATT: He pulls his blade out. (heavy breathing)

6549
04:47:33.294 --> 04:47:35.285
Gills (frilling)

6550
04:47:35.285 --> 04:47:36.318
on the sides of its neck.
TRAVIS: Have we ever had

6551
04:47:36.318 --> 04:47:38.176
two kills in, like?

6552
04:47:39.637 --> 04:47:41.175
And we're not even near done.

6553
04:47:41.175 --> 04:47:43.215
MARISHA: We haven't barely touched these fuckers.

6554
04:47:43.215 --> 04:47:44.538
SAM: I'm still lying in bed.

6555
04:47:44.538 --> 04:47:45.686
ASHLEY: There's two guys left?

6556
04:47:45.686 --> 04:47:47.572
LAURA: There's two big guys left.

6557
04:47:47.572 --> 04:47:48.655
TALIESIN: Are there any little guys left?
SAM: I have not

6558
04:47:48.655 --> 04:47:49.888
been able to get out of bed.

6559
04:47:49.888 --> 04:47:51.645
LIAM: Yes, there is.

6560
04:47:51.645 --> 04:47:52.478
Little guy right here.

6561
04:47:52.478 --> 04:47:53.497
TALIESIN: Okay.

6562
04:47:53.497 --> 04:47:54.871
LAURA: Little guy,

6563
04:47:54.871 --> 04:47:57.662
psycho guy, and the--
SAM: It's a hammock, so I'm just like--

6564
04:47:57.662 --> 04:48:00.412
MATT: All right. Caduceus, you're up.

6565
04:48:01.550 --> 04:48:03.132
Veth, you as well.

6566
04:48:03.132 --> 04:48:04.106
SAM: What, what's that?

6567
04:48:04.106 --> 04:48:06.543
LAURA: You're up next after Caduceus.
SAM: How fucking great.

6568
04:48:06.543 --> 04:48:08.672
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my movement

6569
04:48:08.672 --> 04:48:11.745
as close to Fjord as I can get.

6570
04:48:11.745 --> 04:48:12.578
MATT: Okay.

6571
04:48:14.180 --> 04:48:15.472
LAURA: Is that guy still alive?

6572
04:48:15.472 --> 04:48:16.925
MATT: You can get right next to Fjord.

6573
04:48:16.925 --> 04:48:17.758
TALIESIN: All right.

6574
04:48:17.758 --> 04:48:19.228
LIAM: Where are Grog's hit points now?

6575
04:48:19.228 --> 04:48:21.387
TRAVIS: I miss them every day.

6576
04:48:25.897 --> 04:48:27.799
TALIESIN: And I'm going to--

6577
04:48:27.799 --> 04:48:30.040
MARISHA: You went down as Grog, but your hit points--

6578
04:48:30.040 --> 04:48:32.055
TALIESIN: Orly's out, right?

6579
04:48:32.055 --> 04:48:33.187
MATT: Orly and Fjord are both dead.

6580
04:48:33.187 --> 04:48:35.590
TALIESIN: Okay, that's cool.

6581
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:38.015
I'm going to cast--

6582
04:48:40.893 --> 04:48:42.110
Where is it?

6583
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:43.689
SAM: Did Marius get a kill yet?

6584
04:48:43.689 --> 04:48:45.172
TRAVIS: Who? No.

6585
04:48:45.172 --> 04:48:48.690
TALIESIN: Just figuring it out.
MARISHA: His one job, he has one job.

6586
04:48:48.690 --> 04:48:50.339
MATT: He's not an adventurer, guys.

6587
04:48:51.782 --> 04:48:54.290
TRAVIS: It's not <i>what</i> he is,
it's what he <i>can</i> be.

6588
04:48:54.290 --> 04:48:55.340
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast--

6589
04:48:55.340 --> 04:48:57.906
who's the biggest problem right now?

6590
04:48:57.906 --> 04:48:59.770
LAURA: The dude that just, like--

6591
04:48:59.770 --> 04:49:01.286
MATT: I mean, there's the one guy that killed Fjord--

6592
04:49:01.286 --> 04:49:02.228
TALIESIN: That'll do.

6593
04:49:02.228 --> 04:49:04.903
MATT: -- seems to be visually the most kind of the leader.

6594
04:49:04.903 --> 04:49:07.227
They're all, like, looking and taking cues from this.

6595
04:49:07.227 --> 04:49:08.427
TRAVIS: He's the most hit pointed-up.

6596
04:49:08.427 --> 04:49:10.760
He <i>just</i> had Armor of Agathys be dispelled.

6597
04:49:10.760 --> 04:49:14.111
SAM: Are both people with your sword,
are both people with men?

6598
04:49:14.111 --> 04:49:16.467
ASHLEY: Was he the one that Caleb just hit?
TRAVIS: I can't tell the gender.

6599
04:49:16.467 --> 04:49:19.280
MATT: It's hard to tell gender.

6600
04:49:19.280 --> 04:49:20.884
What are you doing, Caduceus?

6601
04:49:20.884 --> 04:49:25.175
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast

6602
04:49:25.175 --> 04:49:26.141
Blight.

6603
04:49:26.141 --> 04:49:27.455
How far away am I from this?

6604
04:49:27.455 --> 04:49:29.480
MATT: Oh, like 10 feet.

6605
04:49:30.892 --> 04:49:32.258
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: Blight against the main guy?

6606
04:49:32.258 --> 04:49:35.260
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Blight at 5th-level

6607
04:49:35.260 --> 04:49:36.093
against the main guy.
MATT: Okay.

6608
04:49:36.093 --> 04:49:37.995
LAURA: I just put you on my water bottle.

6609
04:49:37.995 --> 04:49:39.536
MATT: That is

6610
04:49:39.536 --> 04:49:40.831
natural 18.

6611
04:49:40.831 --> 04:49:42.247
TALIESIN: Motherfucker.

6612
04:49:42.247 --> 04:49:43.697
MATT: Doesn't get a bonus.

6613
04:49:43.697 --> 04:49:45.578
Oh, no, plus four, so it'd be 22.

6614
04:49:45.578 --> 04:49:47.320
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: Still takes half damage.

6615
04:49:48.935 --> 04:49:53.214
TALIESIN: Okay, that's-- here we go. Half damage is fine.

6616
04:49:53.214 --> 04:49:54.939
LAURA: Are we still doing advantage on

6617
04:49:54.939 --> 04:49:58.170
attacks and saving throws?
MATT: Nope, that faded.

6618
04:49:58.170 --> 04:50:00.320
TALIESIN: This sucks.
ASHLEY: My turn's done.

6619
04:50:01.947 --> 04:50:03.100
12, 17.

6620
04:50:03.100 --> 04:50:05.183
ASHLEY: Oh, we went a full round.

6621
04:50:06.848 --> 04:50:07.690
TALIESIN: 17.

6622
04:50:07.690 --> 04:50:10.547
TRAVIS: Should've had Caleb do the silver string.

6623
04:50:10.547 --> 04:50:11.520
Captain's quarters.

6624
04:50:11.520 --> 04:50:14.327
MARISHA: Oh my god, yeah.
TALIESIN: I rolled wrong, hold on, sorry.

6625
04:50:14.327 --> 04:50:16.568
I was rolling wrong. I'm so sorry, one second.

6626
04:50:16.568 --> 04:50:19.399
'Cause I'm having a mild conniption.

6627
04:50:19.399 --> 04:50:21.525
TRAVIS: Only time we don't sleep in the dome.

6628
04:50:21.525 --> 04:50:22.740
TALIESIN: All right, this'll do it.

6629
04:50:22.740 --> 04:50:27.698
MARISHA: Nice, cozy, just listening
to the rain lull us to sleep.

6630
04:50:29.648 --> 04:50:33.424
TALIESIN: 12 plus 14 is--

6631
04:50:33.424 --> 04:50:34.673
please help.
LAURA: 30.

6632
04:50:34.673 --> 04:50:36.339
TALIESIN: Is 30?
LAURA: No.

6633
04:50:36.339 --> 04:50:38.235
LAURA: 12 plus 14 is 26.

6634
04:50:38.235 --> 04:50:39.476
TALIESIN: 26 and then

6635
04:50:40.620 --> 04:50:44.736
26, 29,

6636
04:50:44.736 --> 04:50:49.720
(counting)

6637
04:50:49.720 --> 04:50:51.990
44 points of necrotic damage.

6638
04:50:51.990 --> 04:50:52.823
LAURA: Wow.

6639
04:50:52.823 --> 04:50:54.488
MATT: It takes 22.

6640
04:50:54.488 --> 04:50:56.360
You see the moisture pull out of the body

6641
04:50:56.360 --> 04:50:58.820
and the gray areas, all of a sudden the veins darken

6642
04:50:58.820 --> 04:51:03.234
and the jaw turns gray on one side goes limp. (snarls)

6643
04:51:03.234 --> 04:51:04.740
Starting to look hurt.

6644
04:51:04.740 --> 04:51:06.415
SAM: <i>Starting</i> to.
TALIESIN: Yeah as a...

6645
04:51:07.842 --> 04:51:11.917
bonus action-- can I do this for a bonus action? Let's see.

6646
04:51:13.711 --> 04:51:14.939
Where are we?

6647
04:51:14.939 --> 04:51:16.388
MATT: Veth, what're you doing?
TALIESIN: Nope, never mind.

6648
04:51:16.388 --> 04:51:19.088
SAM: I'm getting out of bed.

6649
04:51:19.088 --> 04:51:20.395
MATT: There you go.

6650
04:51:20.395 --> 04:51:22.061
SAM: It's half my movement.
MATT: Yeah.

6651
04:51:22.061 --> 04:51:24.392
SAM: Use the other half to go upstairs.

6652
04:51:24.392 --> 04:51:25.690
TALIESIN: Bonus action to turn invisible.

6653
04:51:25.690 --> 04:51:28.782
MATT: You have your action still.
SAM: Bonus action to dash.

6654
04:51:30.673 --> 04:51:32.240
MATT: You emerge right next to Yasha,

6655
04:51:32.240 --> 04:51:33.523
right there, in the middle of the ship.

6656
04:51:35.182 --> 04:51:36.476
SAM: Do I see any enemies?

6657
04:51:36.476 --> 04:51:40.784
And are any of them engaged in a combat scenario?

6658
04:51:42.795 --> 04:51:45.705
MATT: Currently, yes, cause they're both next to Beauregard

6659
04:51:45.705 --> 04:51:50.497
so you can see both. The main guy has half cover,

6660
04:51:50.497 --> 04:51:52.120
the other guy here does not.

6661
04:51:52.120 --> 04:51:55.157
SAM: I will go for the one without half cover.

6662
04:51:55.157 --> 04:51:55.990
MATT: Go for it.

6663
04:51:55.990 --> 04:52:00.990
SAM: And fire-- I will cast Brenatto's Crossbow.

6664
04:52:01.294 --> 04:52:03.185
(laughter)

6665
04:52:03.185 --> 04:52:05.228
SAM: And fire my crossbow.

6666
04:52:05.228 --> 04:52:06.869
MATT: Okay.

6667
04:52:06.869 --> 04:52:08.994
SAM: Shit! 16.

6668
04:52:08.994 --> 04:52:10.502
MATT: 16 against him hits.

6669
04:52:10.502 --> 04:52:13.309
(cheering)

6670
04:52:13.309 --> 04:52:15.784
LAURA: Ooh.
SAM: Hey, that's something.

6671
04:52:16.824 --> 04:52:21.133
Okay, total: 14, 23--

6672
04:52:21.133 --> 04:52:23.530
29 points of damage.

6673
04:52:23.530 --> 04:52:25.230
MATT: Oh man, he's looking real bad.

6674
04:52:25.230 --> 04:52:27.700
(impacts, groaning)

6675
04:52:27.700 --> 04:52:29.820
It tries to pull it out.

6676
04:52:29.820 --> 04:52:32.317
The barbed end of it,

6677
04:52:32.317 --> 04:52:35.112
it pulls some internal organ and viscera with it.

6678
04:52:35.112 --> 04:52:36.930
It throws it on the ground.

6679
04:52:36.930 --> 04:52:39.120
It spatters that weird clear fluid.

6680
04:52:39.120 --> 04:52:39.953
SAM: That's all I got.

6681
04:52:39.953 --> 04:52:42.310
MATT: All right. Top the round, Jester, you're up.

6682
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:44.890
LAURA: I'm going to bring my Spiritual Weapon,

6683
04:52:44.890 --> 04:52:46.380
and slam him in the back of the head.

6684
04:52:46.380 --> 04:52:47.603
MATT: Of the main guy?
LAURA: Yeah.

6685
04:52:47.603 --> 04:52:49.870
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

6686
04:52:50.962 --> 04:52:52.083
LAURA: 22.

6687
04:52:52.083 --> 04:52:52.916
MATT: 22 hits.

6688
04:52:56.575 --> 04:52:59.025
LAURA: Come on! Nine points.

6689
04:52:59.025 --> 04:53:02.808
MATT: Nine points of damage. He takes the hit.

6690
04:53:02.808 --> 04:53:04.410
LAURA: At the same time,

6691
04:53:04.410 --> 04:53:07.205
I'm going to-- is he looking rough, did you say?

6692
04:53:07.205 --> 04:53:08.950
MATT: He's starting to look hurt, yeah.

6693
04:53:08.950 --> 04:53:11.876
LAURA: At 5th-level, I'm going to

6694
04:53:11.876 --> 04:53:14.810
shoot my hand forward and I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt.

6695
04:53:14.810 --> 04:53:17.577
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll for an attack.

6696
04:53:19.230 --> 04:53:20.470
LAURA: 25.

6697
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:22.130
MATT: 25? That definitely hits.

6698
04:53:22.130 --> 04:53:23.563
(laughs)

6699
04:53:24.746 --> 04:53:26.204
TRAVIS: Come on, 5th-level.

6700
04:53:27.660 --> 04:53:30.559
LAURA: Yep, yep. 10, 15--
MARISHA: This the super hurt one?

6701
04:53:31.715 --> 04:53:36.714
LAURA: 19, 21, and then three more.

6702
04:53:36.714 --> 04:53:37.989
SAM: Three more?!

6703
04:53:39.447 --> 04:53:40.588
LAURA: 21.

6704
04:53:40.588 --> 04:53:42.255
27, 29.

6705
04:53:43.197 --> 04:53:47.107
32 points of radiant damage.

6706
04:53:47.107 --> 04:53:48.300
MATT: 32 points of radiant damage?

6707
04:53:48.300 --> 04:53:49.133
LAURA: Yeah.

6708
04:53:49.133 --> 04:53:49.966
MATT: Okay.

6709
04:53:51.227 --> 04:53:54.530
Got it. It blasts him and you
see now he's (wincing, panting).

6710
04:53:54.530 --> 04:53:56.870
It's starting to show some real hurt,

6711
04:53:56.870 --> 04:53:58.940
and now its body is glittering.

6712
04:53:58.940 --> 04:54:00.265
LAURA: Yes.

6713
04:54:00.265 --> 04:54:01.372
TRAVIS: Oh, right, advantage on him.

6714
04:54:01.372 --> 04:54:02.696
MARISHA: Who did you hit? Did you hit--?

6715
04:54:02.696 --> 04:54:04.205
LAURA: The big guy.

6716
04:54:04.205 --> 04:54:05.038
MARISHA: On top of Fjord?

6717
04:54:05.038 --> 04:54:06.338
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

6718
04:54:08.713 --> 04:54:10.496
SAM: Are you going to move position?

6719
04:54:12.448 --> 04:54:15.364
LAURA: I'm going to run forward to the edge of the...

6720
04:54:17.364 --> 04:54:19.795
MATT: To the edge of?

6721
04:54:19.795 --> 04:54:21.777
LAURA: Can I jump down?

6722
04:54:21.777 --> 04:54:23.993
So I can see-- how far can I get?

6723
04:54:23.993 --> 04:54:27.402
MATT: You can get-- from there's (counting) 30.

6724
04:54:27.402 --> 04:54:28.235
You can get there.

6725
04:54:28.235 --> 04:54:29.413
LAURA: No, I'll be about there.

6726
04:54:29.413 --> 04:54:30.746
MATT: Okay.

6727
04:54:30.746 --> 04:54:33.582
LAURA: My god, it's just so much chaos in here.
MATT: I know, isn't it?

6728
04:54:33.582 --> 04:54:36.275
All right, that's your turn?

6729
04:54:36.275 --> 04:54:37.759
LAURA: I don't think I-- (groans)

6730
04:54:38.823 --> 04:54:40.904
MATT: Beau, you're up.

6731
04:54:40.904 --> 04:54:42.246
MARISHA: You good?

6732
04:54:44.515 --> 04:54:49.365
MARISHA: Beau is furious and is going to revert back to

6733
04:54:50.463 --> 04:54:54.088
18-year-old, barroom-brawl Beau,

6734
04:54:54.088 --> 04:54:56.170
and she's going to leap on the back of this fuck

6735
04:54:56.170 --> 04:54:57.430
that killed Fjord.

6736
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:59.096
TRAVIS: Nice, pool hall-style.
MATT: You got it.

6737
04:54:59.096 --> 04:55:00.780
MARISHA: And grab them by the front of his face

6738
04:55:00.780 --> 04:55:03.730
and just fucking pummel him in his fucking face.

6739
04:55:03.730 --> 04:55:04.563
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: Do it.

6740
04:55:04.563 --> 04:55:06.812
MARISHA: Just do, like, that crazy bitch

6741
04:55:06.812 --> 04:55:08.230
on his back.

6742
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:09.338
TRAVIS: Fucking banjo playing.

6743
04:55:09.338 --> 04:55:10.630
MARISHA: Pop.
ASHLEY: (banjo sounds)

6744
04:55:10.630 --> 04:55:11.463
MARISHA: 26.

6745
04:55:11.463 --> 04:55:12.296
MATT: That hits.

6746
04:55:12.296 --> 04:55:14.470
MARISHA: Stunning strike.

6747
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:15.453
MATT: Immune to stun.

6748
04:55:15.453 --> 04:55:16.286
LAURA: Ugh!

6749
04:55:16.286 --> 04:55:18.570
MARISHA: He's immune to stun? That one is?

6750
04:55:18.570 --> 04:55:19.403
MATT: Yep.

6751
04:55:19.403 --> 04:55:21.510
MARISHA: Because I did the thing.

6752
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:24.418
MATT: It's a different creature, a different stat set.

6753
04:55:26.311 --> 04:55:28.400
LAURA: (laughs)

6754
04:55:28.400 --> 04:55:29.233
MATT: Roll damage.

6755
04:55:29.233 --> 04:55:31.756
LAURA: How many things just popped on her?

6756
04:55:31.756 --> 04:55:33.948
TRAVIS: There's a lot. Couple of cracks over here.

6757
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:35.439
TALIESIN: 15 spinal chunks.

6758
04:55:36.317 --> 04:55:37.883
MARISHA: 11.

6759
04:55:37.883 --> 04:55:39.407
LAURA: Marisha's head just falls off.

6760
04:55:39.407 --> 04:55:42.426
MARISHA: (rolling thuds)

6761
04:55:42.426 --> 04:55:43.660
MATT: Oh god!

6762
04:55:43.660 --> 04:55:44.493
SAM: Credits roll.

6763
04:55:44.493 --> 04:55:46.405
MATT: Roll her damage.

6764
04:55:46.405 --> 04:55:50.185
MARISHA: In the Dwarven Forge cam. Second pop: 26 again.

6765
04:55:50.185 --> 04:55:51.543
MATT: 26, all right.

6766
04:55:53.010 --> 04:55:54.216
MARISHA: Eight damage.

6767
04:55:54.216 --> 04:55:55.558
MATT: Eight points of damage, all righty.

6768
04:55:55.558 --> 04:55:56.725
MARISHA: Fuck. And then--

6769
04:55:59.201 --> 04:56:01.210
Oh, I had advantage on that first one, right?

6770
04:56:01.210 --> 04:56:02.150
LAURA: Ah, you did.
MATT: Yes, you did.

6771
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.983
MARISHA: Yeah.

6772
04:56:02.983 --> 04:56:04.649
MATT: Go ahead and roll just to see.
MARISHA: A critical? Nope.

6773
04:56:04.649 --> 04:56:05.720
MATT: Okay.

6774
04:56:05.720 --> 04:56:06.761
MARISHA: And...

6775
04:56:08.543 --> 04:56:11.423
Flurry of Blows. Fuck this guy.

6776
04:56:11.423 --> 04:56:12.780
Pop pop.

6777
04:56:12.780 --> 04:56:15.280
Just four, and that one's cocked.

6778
04:56:16.180 --> 04:56:18.182
Okay, 25 and 19.

6779
04:56:18.182 --> 04:56:19.860
SAM: Yeah!
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage.

6780
04:56:19.860 --> 04:56:20.693
SAM: Killer.

6781
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:29.205
MARISHA: Ooh, double eights, 16 plus 12.

6782
04:56:30.131 --> 04:56:31.245
What is that?

6783
04:56:31.245 --> 04:56:33.320
16, 28, 30. 30!

6784
04:56:33.320 --> 04:56:35.150
MATT: 30. Ooh, he's hurting.

6785
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:37.610
MARISHA: Wait. 28. 28? 16 plus--

6786
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:38.443
TRAVIS: 18 plus 12?

6787
04:56:38.443 --> 04:56:40.109
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: 30.

6788
04:56:40.109 --> 04:56:41.543
MARISHA: 30. He's still standing?

6789
04:56:41.543 --> 04:56:43.017
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Fuck.

6790
04:56:43.017 --> 04:56:43.850
MATT: Tough one.

6791
04:56:43.850 --> 04:56:45.075
Does that finish your turn, Beau?

6792
04:56:45.075 --> 04:56:46.403
MARISHA: Yeah.

6793
04:56:47.320 --> 04:56:49.287
MATT: It's now his turn.
MARISHA: I've got him by the hair.

6794
04:56:49.287 --> 04:56:51.664
TALIESIN: Takes damage.
MATT: Yes, top of his turn.

6795
04:56:51.664 --> 04:56:53.750
LAURA: Oh, good, good, good.

6796
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:56.149
MATT: That is a 19.

6797
04:56:56.149 --> 04:56:58.307
TALIESIN: That does make his, so he takes half damage.

6798
04:56:59.820 --> 04:57:02.228
That's pretty good. That's okay.

6799
04:57:02.228 --> 04:57:06.218
(counting)

6800
04:57:06.218 --> 04:57:08.610
14. So half, that's seven points of damage.

6801
04:57:08.610 --> 04:57:09.443
MATT: You've got it.

6802
04:57:09.443 --> 04:57:10.276
TALIESIN: Of radiant damage.

6803
04:57:10.276 --> 04:57:12.046
LAURA: Did you add anything to it?
TALIESIN: There's nothing to add.

6804
04:57:12.046 --> 04:57:12.879
MATT: 7 points there.

6805
04:57:12.879 --> 04:57:16.221
TALIESIN: And half movement for inside the circles.

6806
04:57:16.221 --> 04:57:17.086
MATT: You got it.

6807
04:57:17.086 --> 04:57:19.144
All right. It's going to turn to the others and go,

6808
04:57:19.144 --> 04:57:20.669
(hissing speech)

6809
04:57:20.669 --> 04:57:21.985
ALL: No!

6810
04:57:21.985 --> 04:57:23.580
MATT: Starts speaking in a language that I don't think

6811
04:57:23.580 --> 04:57:24.413
any of you understand.

6812
04:57:24.413 --> 04:57:25.310
LIAM: Is it magical?

6813
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:26.270
MATT: No.
LIAM: No.

6814
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:28.146
MATT: Not this statement.

6815
04:57:28.146 --> 04:57:29.134
MARISHA: Is it Deep Speech?

6816
04:57:29.134 --> 04:57:31.201
MATT: Then it reaches down-- no, it is not--

6817
04:57:31.201 --> 04:57:34.834
grabs Fjord by the chest--
ASHLEY: Don't you fucking dare.

6818
04:57:34.834 --> 04:57:36.375
MATT: --and is going to attempt to Dimension Door.

6819
04:57:36.375 --> 04:57:37.230
LIAM: Counterspell.

6820
04:57:37.230 --> 04:57:38.655
SAM: Yes.
LIAM: 4th-level.

6821
04:57:40.844 --> 04:57:42.920
MATT: And does not go anywhere.

6822
04:57:42.920 --> 04:57:44.415
Well, no, because it is a 5th-level spell,

6823
04:57:44.415 --> 04:57:45.989
because it's a warlock, so you do still have to roll.

6824
04:57:45.989 --> 04:57:46.822
LIAM: Okay.

6825
04:57:46.822 --> 04:57:48.672
SAM: Ooh boy!
LAURA: Oh god!

6826
04:57:48.672 --> 04:57:51.097
SAM: Ooh.

6827
04:57:51.097 --> 04:57:54.041
MATT: Yeah, because it's all 5th-level spots
as a warlock, so roll.

6828
04:57:54.041 --> 04:57:54.974
LIAM: What am I doing here?

6829
04:57:54.974 --> 04:57:56.190
SAM: Rolling against--

6830
04:57:56.190 --> 04:57:57.060
MATT: You're rolling--

6831
04:57:57.060 --> 04:58:00.270
LIAM: A d10 plus the spell's level.

6832
04:58:00.270 --> 04:58:01.210
And it's my--

6833
04:58:01.210 --> 04:58:02.460
MATT: So a d10.

6834
04:58:02.460 --> 04:58:03.970
LIAM: And I add my modifier, right?

6835
04:58:03.970 --> 04:58:06.300
MATT: Correct, your intelligence modifier.

6836
04:58:06.300 --> 04:58:07.276
LIAM: 17.

6837
04:58:07.276 --> 04:58:08.829
MATT: He does not move.

6838
04:58:08.829 --> 04:58:10.463
(relieved cheering)

6839
04:58:10.463 --> 04:58:13.640
MATT: You watch as this purple energy begins to rise.

6840
04:58:13.640 --> 04:58:16.602
This dark ocean begins to swell up around

6841
04:58:16.602 --> 04:58:18.867
the two of them, and as it releases the incantation

6842
04:58:18.867 --> 04:58:22.823
to slam the ground, Caleb, flying up, sends his hands down

6843
04:58:22.823 --> 04:58:26.080
in this net. This spiraling net

6844
04:58:26.080 --> 04:58:30.166
of arcane runes grapples around and shatters

6845
04:58:30.166 --> 04:58:33.141
the growing doorway. Suddenly it's like, (frustrated growl).

6846
04:58:33.141 --> 04:58:35.732
Looks up angrily at you. (snarling)

6847
04:58:35.732 --> 04:58:37.692
SAM: Oh god.

6848
04:58:37.692 --> 04:58:38.730
MATT: It's going to try and move.

6849
04:58:38.730 --> 04:58:39.563
TALIESIN: Half speed.

6850
04:58:39.563 --> 04:58:42.136
MATT: Half speed with Fjord. You do have your reaction.

6851
04:58:42.136 --> 04:58:42.969
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

6852
04:58:42.969 --> 04:58:43.802
MATT: Make your attack.

6853
04:58:43.802 --> 04:58:45.091
LIAM: Kick his ass.

6854
04:58:45.091 --> 04:58:47.870
TALIESIN: Am I within range to make a reaction?

6855
04:58:47.870 --> 04:58:48.703
MATT: No.

6856
04:58:48.703 --> 04:58:49.560
MARISHA: 16 I think hits?

6857
04:58:49.560 --> 04:58:51.185
MATT: 16--

6858
04:58:51.185 --> 04:58:53.902
No. 17 is his armor class.

6859
04:58:55.393 --> 04:58:56.868
LIAM: Kick his ass, Bob!

6860
04:58:58.059 --> 04:58:58.901
SAM: Denied.

6861
04:58:58.901 --> 04:59:00.714
MATT: He's going to go ahead and --

6862
04:59:00.714 --> 04:59:02.118
TRAVIS: This way?

6863
04:59:02.118 --> 04:59:05.031
MATT: Half speed? Oh man, that half speed is fucking me up.

6864
04:59:05.031 --> 04:59:06.222
LAURA: Plus he's dragging Fjord, so.

6865
04:59:06.222 --> 04:59:10.450
MATT: Yeah, so he only gets, like, over to here.

6866
04:59:10.450 --> 04:59:12.440
LAURA: Does Marius get an attack?

6867
04:59:12.440 --> 04:59:13.850
MATT: No, technically he's in--

6868
04:59:13.850 --> 04:59:17.262
TRAVIS: Please, leave my fate to Marius.

6869
04:59:17.262 --> 04:59:19.383
(laughter)

6870
04:59:19.383 --> 04:59:23.408
SAM: "I'll help you! Ah, I'm off the boat."

6871
04:59:24.290 --> 04:59:26.608
MATT: Yeah, no, that half speed and dragging,

6872
04:59:26.608 --> 04:59:29.970
yeah, that's as far as he gets. Trying to drag Fjord

6873
04:59:29.970 --> 04:59:32.220
up on the edge because he has no other options.

6874
04:59:32.220 --> 04:59:33.957
Fucking Counterspell.

6875
04:59:33.957 --> 04:59:36.075
My bane!

6876
04:59:36.075 --> 04:59:36.908
All right.

6877
04:59:38.290 --> 04:59:39.773
Yasha, your turn.

6878
04:59:39.773 --> 04:59:41.765
MARISHA: Yasha!

6879
04:59:41.765 --> 04:59:43.148
ASHLEY: So, I'm going to--

6880
04:59:43.148 --> 04:59:44.617
can I get to him?

6881
04:59:44.617 --> 04:59:48.449
MATT: Yeah, you can get over, rushing past through Caduceus.
LAURA: Yeah, kill him!

6882
04:59:48.449 --> 04:59:49.313
MATT: You can come around this way

6883
04:59:49.313 --> 04:59:51.437
or you can go up on the edge of the boat. Up to you.

6884
04:59:51.437 --> 04:59:52.730
ASHLEY: I'll come around this way.

6885
04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:54.170
MATT: You come around this way.

6886
04:59:54.170 --> 04:59:55.253
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

6887
04:59:55.253 --> 04:59:58.410
MATT: It's dragging Fjord's lifeless corpse up towards

6888
04:59:58.410 --> 05:00:01.940
the lip of the boat, getting ready to jump into the ocean.

6889
05:00:01.940 --> 05:00:03.591
ASHLEY: Okay.

6890
05:00:03.591 --> 05:00:06.222
TRAVIS: Why? What'd I do?

6891
05:00:06.222 --> 05:00:07.937
LAURA: Because you've got the fucking thing still in you!

6892
05:00:07.937 --> 05:00:08.894
ASHLEY: 22.

6893
05:00:08.894 --> 05:00:10.888
TRAVIS: No, I don't.

6894
05:00:10.888 --> 05:00:12.262
MATT: Yeah, you do.
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do.

6895
05:00:12.262 --> 05:00:14.151
LAURA: You still got an orb in you, yo.

6896
05:00:14.151 --> 05:00:17.770
SAM: You had-- there was two. One fell out.

6897
05:00:17.770 --> 05:00:19.428
TRAVIS: But it was in the sword.

6898
05:00:19.428 --> 05:00:22.337
MATT: Well, the sword was symbolic of you having it.

6899
05:00:22.337 --> 05:00:23.281
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6900
05:00:23.281 --> 05:00:25.523
TRAVIS: Oh.

6901
05:00:25.523 --> 05:00:26.595
ASHLEY: 22.

6902
05:00:26.595 --> 05:00:28.490
MATT: 22 hits.
SAM: Should have done x-rays!

6903
05:00:29.348 --> 05:00:34.348
LAURA: The ball's been inside of me this whole time.
ASHLEY: Seven, eight. I'm going to roll Savage Attacker.

6904
05:00:34.710 --> 05:00:36.688
It's the same, okay.

6905
05:00:36.688 --> 05:00:38.297
Five, six, seven.

6906
05:00:38.297 --> 05:00:39.138
I know.

6907
05:00:39.138 --> 05:00:40.405
Eight, that was better.

6908
05:00:40.405 --> 05:00:42.429
18 for the first hit.

6909
05:00:42.429 --> 05:00:43.432
MATT: How do you want to do this?

6910
05:00:43.432 --> 05:00:44.953
(cheering)

6911
05:00:44.953 --> 05:00:48.677
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, so he has a tentacle, yeah?

6912
05:00:48.677 --> 05:00:51.025
MATT: No tentacle. He's just, like, this giant clawed hand

6913
05:00:51.025 --> 05:00:53.585
and dragging Fjord by the chest wound

6914
05:00:53.585 --> 05:00:55.252
up towards the edge of the ship.

6915
05:00:55.252 --> 05:00:57.520
ASHLEY: Okay I want to do, like, a

6916
05:00:57.520 --> 05:00:59.778
Black Widow wrap around his neck.

6917
05:00:59.778 --> 05:01:02.084
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: (choking)

6918
05:01:02.084 --> 05:01:04.614
ASHLEY: And then I want to just pull his head back

6919
05:01:04.614 --> 05:01:06.147
so his neck breaks.

6920
05:01:06.147 --> 05:01:07.078
MATT: (snapping)

6921
05:01:07.078 --> 05:01:09.261
ASHLEY: And then I want to take his body,

6922
05:01:09.261 --> 05:01:10.919
throw it over the side,

6923
05:01:10.919 --> 05:01:14.039
and wrap his claw around a belaying pin

6924
05:01:14.039 --> 05:01:16.668
so he's a warning for anybody else who would

6925
05:01:16.668 --> 05:01:18.988
try to find the ship.
TRAVIS: Fucking sick!

6926
05:01:18.988 --> 05:01:21.177
MATT: After you snap his neck, you throw the body over,

6927
05:01:21.177 --> 05:01:25.292
and because the bones are, like, weirdly flexible,

6928
05:01:25.292 --> 05:01:27.802
you take and wrap it around, and the arm actually bends,

6929
05:01:27.802 --> 05:01:30.039
and wraps as it breaks in the same way,

6930
05:01:30.039 --> 05:01:32.280
and dislodges at all the joints,

6931
05:01:32.280 --> 05:01:33.888
and you take into you wrap it in

6932
05:01:33.888 --> 05:01:36.448
and he's just now dangling off the side of the ship,

6933
05:01:36.448 --> 05:01:38.198
the rain pouring.

6934
05:01:38.198 --> 05:01:41.402
ASHLEY: Okay, and then where's Fjord at this point?

6935
05:01:41.402 --> 05:01:44.160
MATT: Fjord is on the ground
right next to you just slumped there.

6936
05:01:44.160 --> 05:01:45.480
ASHLEY: Is still there another guy?

6937
05:01:45.480 --> 05:01:48.949
LAURA: Yeah, there is. There's another guy, Yasha.

6938
05:01:48.949 --> 05:01:51.785
MATT: You have another attack, if you want.
ASHLEY: I do have another attack, okay.

6939
05:01:51.785 --> 05:01:54.193
But he's on the ship? Fjord's on the ship?

6940
05:01:54.193 --> 05:01:56.527
MARISHA: He's next to me right there.

6941
05:01:56.527 --> 05:01:59.173
ASHLEY: Okay, so the other guy, I'll take an attack on him.

6942
05:01:59.173 --> 05:02:00.618
LIAM: Can you get there?

6943
05:02:00.618 --> 05:02:02.302
ASHLEY: Well yeah, where is he? I can't see with--

6944
05:02:02.302 --> 05:02:05.275
MATT: Right there, that guy's back right there.

6945
05:02:05.275 --> 05:02:06.267
LIAM: There's a guy by Beau.

6946
05:02:06.267 --> 05:02:08.415
MARISHA: Oh. Oh, there's two guys.

6947
05:02:08.415 --> 05:02:09.340
LIAM: Two guys.
MATT: Yep.

6948
05:02:09.340 --> 05:02:11.332
ASHLEY: There's two guys, okay.

6949
05:02:12.582 --> 05:02:14.691
Whoever I can get to from there.

6950
05:02:14.691 --> 05:02:16.634
MATT: Yep, there's the guy right there.

6951
05:02:16.634 --> 05:02:17.967
ASHLEY: Okay, got it.

6952
05:02:20.746 --> 05:02:23.062
Yeah, okay, same. So

6953
05:02:23.062 --> 05:02:24.428
22.

6954
05:02:24.428 --> 05:02:25.557
MATT: 22, okay.

6955
05:02:25.557 --> 05:02:26.587
ASHLEY: Does that hit?

6956
05:02:26.587 --> 05:02:27.570
MATT: That does hit, yes.

6957
05:02:27.570 --> 05:02:28.403
ASHLEY: Okay.

6958
05:02:32.195 --> 05:02:33.592
13 points of damage.

6959
05:02:33.592 --> 05:02:35.287
MATT: 13 points of damage, got it.

6960
05:02:35.287 --> 05:02:36.724
ASHLEY: Oh, this is so stressful.

6961
05:02:36.724 --> 05:02:37.557
MATT: Okay.

6962
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:42.060
That finishes Yasha's go. It's now his turn.

6963
05:02:42.060 --> 05:02:45.003
He's going to go ahead and flee.
It's going to attempt to run--

6964
05:02:45.003 --> 05:02:47.204
LAURA: Can I get attack opportunity?
TALIESIN: And also start of his turn--

6965
05:02:47.204 --> 05:02:48.329
MATT: It does. Yep!

6966
05:02:48.329 --> 05:02:52.227
TRAVIS: Squad! What a squad!
SAM: (condescending halting noises)

6967
05:02:52.227 --> 05:02:53.975
TALIESIN: Make your save.
MATT: Fails his save.

6968
05:02:53.975 --> 05:02:55.608
TALIESIN: That's 16 points radiant damage

6969
05:02:55.608 --> 05:02:56.973
and he's still half speed.

6970
05:02:56.973 --> 05:02:58.714
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: And I--

6971
05:03:00.093 --> 05:03:01.684
I hit him with a 19.

6972
05:03:01.684 --> 05:03:03.384
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: With my axe.

6973
05:03:03.384 --> 05:03:05.155
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.
LAURA: I have an axe!

6974
05:03:05.155 --> 05:03:06.519
MATT: Yasha, you actually get an
attack of opportunity as well.

6975
05:03:06.519 --> 05:03:07.352
ASHLEY: Yes!

6976
05:03:09.809 --> 05:03:10.642
Ooh!

6977
05:03:12.121 --> 05:03:13.448
MATT: You do the additional damage, too, because--

6978
05:03:13.448 --> 05:03:15.663
LAURA: Yeah, because of the poison thing.

6979
05:03:15.663 --> 05:03:16.496
MATT: Yep.

6980
05:03:17.478 --> 05:03:19.176
LAURA: Eight points. How much extra?

6981
05:03:19.176 --> 05:03:20.827
ASHLEY: 27.
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

6982
05:03:24.580 --> 05:03:27.913
LAURA: 14 points of damage.
MATT: 14 points of damage, nice.

6983
05:03:29.136 --> 05:03:30.540
ASHLEY: 15.

6984
05:03:30.540 --> 05:03:32.654
MATT: Yeah, no. He tries to run and just gets--

6985
05:03:32.654 --> 05:03:34.763
He's like (impacts).

6986
05:03:34.763 --> 05:03:38.267
(laughter)
Fucking Ginsu-ed from every which way.

6987
05:03:38.267 --> 05:03:39.632
Caleb, you're up.

6988
05:03:39.632 --> 05:03:41.082
SAM: Wait, who's still alive?

6989
05:03:41.082 --> 05:03:42.528
MATT: There's one guy right there.

6990
05:03:42.528 --> 05:03:44.137
LAURA: Fucking--
LIAM: Big one.

6991
05:03:44.137 --> 05:03:45.262
LAURA: -- the stunner.

6992
05:03:45.262 --> 05:03:47.542
MARISHA: He's almost dead, though.
MATT: Yeah, he's looking really bad.

6993
05:03:47.542 --> 05:03:49.773
LIAM: Caleb just pulls out his adder's stomach

6994
05:03:49.773 --> 05:03:51.637
and draws it back like it's a bow

6995
05:03:51.637 --> 05:03:54.857
and releases Melf's Acid Arrow at 5th-level.

6996
05:03:54.857 --> 05:03:55.690
MATT: All right.

6997
05:03:55.690 --> 05:03:58.612
LAURA: Are you sure it's not Widogast's Acid Arrow?

6998
05:03:58.612 --> 05:04:00.581
LIAM: No, it's another famous wizard.

6999
05:04:00.581 --> 05:04:03.833
TRAVIS: Yeah!
(laughter)

7000
05:04:03.833 --> 05:04:04.674
MATT: Power play.

7001
05:04:04.674 --> 05:04:07.783
All right, is it a dexterity save or a spell attack?

7002
05:04:07.783 --> 05:04:09.124
LIAM: Make a-- it's dex.

7003
05:04:09.124 --> 05:04:10.357
MATT: Dex.

7004
05:04:10.357 --> 05:04:13.362
That is a natural two. Go ahead and roll damage.

7005
05:04:13.362 --> 05:04:16.154
LIAM: Four plus additional for everything

7006
05:04:16.154 --> 05:04:18.785
above two, so another three.

7007
05:04:18.785 --> 05:04:20.343
TRAVIS: Make him hurt.

7008
05:04:22.120 --> 05:04:24.067
LIAM: That's four--
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.

7009
05:04:24.067 --> 05:04:26.075
LIAM: -- eight, 12-- it is good.

7010
05:04:26.075 --> 05:04:28.470
16, 19.

7011
05:04:28.470 --> 05:04:29.822
MATT: How do you want to do this?

7012
05:04:29.822 --> 05:04:31.138
LIAM: 19, 21.

7013
05:04:31.138 --> 05:04:32.321
MATT: How do you want to do this, Caleb?

7014
05:04:32.321 --> 05:04:33.379
MARISHA: Lucky 21!

7015
05:04:33.379 --> 05:04:35.304
MATT: He's turning to try and jump off the ship.

7016
05:04:35.304 --> 05:04:40.003
LIAM: Yeah, as he's jumping, a beam of green arcane energy

7017
05:04:40.003 --> 05:04:41.761
shoots straight through the back of his head,

7018
05:04:41.761 --> 05:04:44.402
and then just starts to melt down and

7019
05:04:44.402 --> 05:04:46.368
melts a line down through his head,

7020
05:04:46.368 --> 05:04:48.522
down through his neck and through his chest.

7021
05:04:48.522 --> 05:04:51.587
MATT: Runs towards the edge and then (splashing)

7022
05:04:51.587 --> 05:04:54.230
slumps over the side and you watch the body slowly

7023
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:56.307
(sloughing) melts in the middle of it

7024
05:04:56.307 --> 05:05:00.730
and it just slops to the ground in two halves.

7025
05:05:00.730 --> 05:05:02.535
LIAM: And I will use my movement to fly

7026
05:05:02.535 --> 05:05:06.643
and drop right down by Fjord's body and check in.

7027
05:05:06.643 --> 05:05:09.135
And here we are.

7028
05:05:09.135 --> 05:05:11.114
SAM: So wait, we've got Orly and Fjord dead?

7029
05:05:11.114 --> 05:05:12.080
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

7030
05:05:12.080 --> 05:05:12.913
MATT: As you all--

7031
05:05:12.913 --> 05:05:15.311
ASHLEY: I'm shaking.

7032
05:05:15.311 --> 05:05:19.773
MATT: As you all, standing in the pouring rain here

7033
05:05:19.773 --> 05:05:21.848
on the deck of your ship.

7034
05:05:22.786 --> 05:05:24.619
LAURA: What is he going to do?

7035
05:05:25.978 --> 05:05:26.811
MATT: Sorry.

7036
05:05:27.949 --> 05:05:29.691
I need me some rain sounds.

7037
05:05:29.691 --> 05:05:32.524
SAM: Got to have some rain sounds for the drama.

7038
05:05:35.717 --> 05:05:38.843
MATT: You all independently walk up to see there,

7039
05:05:38.843 --> 05:05:42.243
in scattered pools of blood, unmoving,

7040
05:05:43.133 --> 05:05:48.133
the dead bodies of Fjord and Orly.

7041
05:05:48.457 --> 05:05:52.049
The storm still flashing overhead,

7042
05:05:52.049 --> 05:05:54.358
the thunder still roaring

7043
05:05:55.448 --> 05:05:58.282
in the middle of this moonless night.

7044
05:05:58.282 --> 05:05:59.942
None of the other armada ships, as far as you know,

7045
05:05:59.942 --> 05:06:02.217
are aware of what transpired here.

7046
05:06:02.217 --> 05:06:03.833
It sinks in

7047
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:09.464
what had happened, possibly why,

7048
05:06:11.850 --> 05:06:15.259
and what needs to hopefully be done to rectify it.

7049
05:06:16.134 --> 05:06:17.401
And that's where we're going to end tonight's next episode.

7050
05:06:17.401 --> 05:06:19.983
TRAVIS: (groans)

7051
05:06:19.983 --> 05:06:21.524
LIAM: Wow!

7052
05:06:21.524 --> 05:06:23.779
MATT: Oh shit, we went late! I'm so sorry!

7053
05:06:23.779 --> 05:06:25.405
I wasn't even paying attention to the time.

7054
05:06:25.405 --> 05:06:26.855
Oh no, I feel really bad.

7055
05:06:26.855 --> 05:06:27.688
LIAM: What a thrill ride.

7056
05:06:27.688 --> 05:06:30.708
TRAVIS: We're the ones RPing
halfway through the boat voyage.

7057
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:33.133
MATT: No, it's great, man.
TRAVIS: No, it's good.

7058
05:06:33.133 --> 05:06:36.556
LIAM: We did a Chekhov play for the first hour.

7059
05:06:36.556 --> 05:06:40.885
TRAVIS: I'm glad this happened here and not in Chicago.

7060
05:06:40.885 --> 05:06:42.862
MARISHA: Mmm. Mmm!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

7061
05:06:42.862 --> 05:06:43.837
SAM: Wow!

7062
05:06:43.837 --> 05:06:45.136
TRAVIS: This map was out.

7063
05:06:45.136 --> 05:06:46.652
MARISHA: I know.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

7064
05:06:46.652 --> 05:06:50.500
MARISHA: Well, these were the
things he was crafting, I think.

7065
05:06:50.500 --> 05:06:52.602
MATT: Those were the things I was
building in secret in the hotel room.

7066
05:06:52.602 --> 05:06:55.255
TRAVIS: I have the third orb still in me;
it wasn't in the sword,

7067
05:06:55.255 --> 05:06:57.570
it was just representative of what's in my chest?

7068
05:06:57.570 --> 05:06:59.713
MATT: The way he was attacking you seem to be continuously

7069
05:06:59.713 --> 05:07:01.779
going for the chest--

7070
05:07:01.779 --> 05:07:05.445
TALIESIN: Keep digging.
MATT: -- where you had placed all the orbs into.

7071
05:07:05.445 --> 05:07:09.120
TRAVIS: That imagery with Yasha and the Fjord dream before

7072
05:07:09.120 --> 05:07:10.962
everything went wrong was amazing.

7073
05:07:10.962 --> 05:07:11.937
LAURA: What I loved was, like,

7074
05:07:11.937 --> 05:07:13.253
you were watching Yasha have a dream

7075
05:07:13.253 --> 05:07:14.811
and I looked over and you were like,

7076
05:07:14.811 --> 05:07:16.253
"Thank god it's not me."

7077
05:07:16.253 --> 05:07:17.914
TRAVIS: 100%.

7078
05:07:17.914 --> 05:07:20.160
LAURA: It's so hard when it's like, I know!
TRAVIS: I looked at Marisha and we like,

7079
05:07:20.160 --> 05:07:22.205
"I hate it when he gets like this--

7080
05:07:22.205 --> 05:07:23.588
"What?!"

7081
05:07:23.588 --> 05:07:25.263
ASHLEY: You try to not make eye contact with him.

7082
05:07:25.263 --> 05:07:26.445
I was, like--

7083
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:28.550
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Wow.

7084
05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:30.243
LAURA: It's so much pressure!
ASHLEY: So much pressure.

7085
05:07:30.243 --> 05:07:31.716
LIAM: Great game.
MATT: Great game, guys.

7086
05:07:31.716 --> 05:07:33.823
SAM: Revivify you have to do within a minute,

7087
05:07:33.823 --> 05:07:36.966
and it's going to be a whole week.

7088
05:07:36.966 --> 05:07:39.132
TRAVIS: It's been two rounds.

7089
05:07:39.132 --> 05:07:40.452
MATT: It's been two rounds.
LAURA: No!

7090
05:07:40.452 --> 05:07:41.285
ASHLEY: It's close.

7091
05:07:41.285 --> 05:07:42.413
LAURA: It's only-- We've got time.

7092
05:07:42.413 --> 05:07:43.350
TALIESIN: I also have--
MATT: Two rounds.

7093
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:45.837
TALIESIN: I actually have spells that can ex--

7094
05:07:45.837 --> 05:07:47.328
Yeah. There's stuff.

7095
05:07:47.328 --> 05:07:49.023
ASHLEY: There's stuff.
TALIESIN: There's stuff. I've got a lot of stuff.

7096
05:07:49.023 --> 05:07:50.982
TRAVIS: Just nobody trip on the way over, okay?

7097
05:07:50.982 --> 05:07:55.915
SAM: (falling, impact)
Oh no, I stabbed Fjord again!

7098
05:07:57.372 --> 05:07:59.798
MATT: All right, we'll pick up here next Thursday.

7099
05:07:59.798 --> 05:08:02.047
Thank you guys so much for sticking with us.

7100
05:08:02.047 --> 05:08:04.147
Have a wonderful night.

7101
05:08:04.147 --> 05:08:07.410
We love you very much and is it Thursday yet?

7102
05:08:07.410 --> 05:08:09.026
Good night.
LIAM: Wowie wowie.

7103
05:08:09.026 --> 05:08:11.776
(dramatic orchestral folk music)

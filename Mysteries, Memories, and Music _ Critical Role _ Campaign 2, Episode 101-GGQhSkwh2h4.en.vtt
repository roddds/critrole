00:00:01.152 --> 00:00:02.997
MATT: Hello everybody, and welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:02.997 --> 00:00:04.857
of Critical Role, where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:06.752
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.752 --> 00:00:11.330
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.710
MATT: Second episode back. Ah, I've missed this.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.997
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:17.317
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.754
so bear with us for just a moment.

00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:20.990
First and foremost, no sponsor tonight,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.487
but Sam, you said you wanted to say something?

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:25.417
SAM: Yeah. Tonight, I'm going to
perform the most important ad

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.717
of my career. I'm going to advertise myself.

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:30.297
ASHLEY: Oh!
SAM: Because we have no sponsor,

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:32.467
so instead, I'm offering my services

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:34.607
to the advertising world out there.

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:35.535
TRAVIS: Oh god.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.755
LIAM: He might do this every day.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.227
SAM: Advertisers, sponsors, products, companies,

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:44.057
I'm ready for you. Send me your ideas,

00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:45.785
I will sell your shit for you!

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:48.107
Doesn't matter if it's bad, I'll still sell it,

00:00:48.107 --> 00:00:52.127
I don't care, I don't have any sort of shame.

00:00:52.127 --> 00:00:54.137
So just to demonstrate my skills,

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:57.654
I'm going to take a kale chip, everybody hates kale chips!

00:00:57.654 --> 00:00:58.905
(chip crunching)

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:01.417
Mm! Amazing, so good! Right?

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:04.032
That's the kind of quality you can get in your ad.

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.217
(laughter)

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:10.036
In fact, I can even make up shitty songs, ready?

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:13.420
♪ Set sail, set sail, set sail with kale! ♪

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.165
♪ Oh no, it's a whale! We're frail; we should bail. ♪

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:17.240
(laughter)

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.988
♪ What's this? The kale, the whale likes kale! ♪

00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:22.407
♪ We won't be assailed thanks to kale! ♪

00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:24.767
See, that took me six seconds to write,

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:28.466
and I can churn out this shit all day for you.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:32.717
So, please, please, when you're thinking of insincerity,

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:33.727
think of Sam Riegel.

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.467
Back to you, Matt.
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.884
TRAVIS: How do you do our stuff?
LAURA: Yeah!

00:01:37.884 --> 00:01:40.626
(laughter)

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:42.247
MATT: Next up, Marisha, you had some announcements to make.

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:46.471
MARISHA: Oh yes, our next episode of Mighty Vibes

00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.197

And this time, it's featuring me, I'll be joining

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:18.477
with Sam and Liam.

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:20.227
SAM: Is that true?
LIAM: It was a good one!

00:02:20.227 --> 00:02:21.060
MARISHA: It's great!

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.877
SAM: It was, when we shot that episode was really good.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:28.187
MARISHA: I loved it when we talked about that thing.

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:31.705
Yeah, so you can catch that VOD,

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.297
on Thursday, next Thursday.

00:02:34.297 --> 00:02:36.377
TRAVIS: The future is awesome!

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:38.502
SAM: Not this Thursday, which is--?

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:39.736
MARISHA: Um!

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:41.469
(laughter)

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.267
A place in time.

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:47.797
Yeah, but the next Thursday.
SAM: Got it, got it, sure.

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:50.060
TRAVIS: Some DARPA math.
MARISHA: Uh-huh!

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.677
LIAM: ♪ Gonna be the future soon ♪

00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:54.367
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: Oh man.

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:56.487
LAURA: Good job, Marisha!
MATT: Well done, well done.

00:02:56.487 --> 00:02:57.987
MARISHA: Yay!

00:02:57.987 --> 00:03:00.973
MATT: And good Jonathan Coulton drop, Liam.

00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:02.147
Laura and Taliesin, you guys had

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:03.567
something to talk about, right?

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.317
LAURA: Well, I'll start it off.
TALIESIN: Yeah, please.

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:10.270
LAURA: Yeah, so we have been working with

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.716
(gasp) McFarlane Toys!
(exclaiming)

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:17.037
For quite a while now, I'm very happy to let you know

00:03:17.037 --> 00:03:22.037
that our figure-- I don't want to say what it is yet--

00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:25.917
is available in the US and the UK stores right now!

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:26.750
TALIESIN: Whoa.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.750
LAURA: And it's never going to
get made again, so it's there.

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:36.997
So I will show you a-this!

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.187
Is the box, can you guess who it is?

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.847
Yeah, so this is our Mollymauk figure.

00:03:43.847 --> 00:03:47.377
It's a freaking phenomenal box.

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:48.467
TALIESIN: It's got foil.

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:51.217
LAURA: The inside is! (gasps)
SAM: Wait, where's the thing!

00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:52.747
LAURA: Oh no!
LIAM: It got away!

00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:54.457
LAURA: Where is the figure?
SAM: It died!

00:03:54.457 --> 00:03:57.979
TALIESIN: Oh, you mean this thing?
(exclaiming)

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.637
ASHLEY: Gorgeous!
MATT: That's so cool.

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:03.027
TALIESIN: Turning him, turning him.
MARISHA: Look!

00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:06.717
LAURA: I mean, it's insane!
TRAVIS: He's sexy!

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:08.807
LAURA: So yeah, Molly has--
ASHLEY: I want on so bad.

00:04:08.807 --> 00:04:12.037
LAURA: -- his signature robe, and tarot cards in his hand.

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:15.015
You may notice his two scimitars,

00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:15.967
that's what they're called, right?

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:18.543
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, you're doing fine.

00:04:18.543 --> 00:04:20.177
LAURA: They're removable!
TALIESIN: Of course they are!

00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:23.337
Actually, in proper McFarlane fashion,

00:04:23.337 --> 00:04:26.257
they are removable, and it does take about 30 minutes

00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:27.696
to get it out of the packaging.

00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:28.947
(laughter)

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:30.707
Which is honestly all I ever want

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:31.917
out of a McFarlane toy figure.

00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:34.987
I want to sit there with an Exacto knife and tweezers,

00:04:34.987 --> 00:04:36.097
going, "Goddamn it!"

00:04:36.097 --> 00:04:37.849
So.
(laughter)

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.207
It's very well packaged, and actually,

00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:41.917
our box art is so beautiful, the whole thing is!

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:43.947
LAURA: It's so beautiful, and Taliesin--
LIAM: Look at that beautiful peacock!

00:04:43.947 --> 00:04:46.127
LAURA: Taliesin gave notes every single step of the way,

00:04:46.127 --> 00:04:50.131
and just really, like-- everything is based on canon,

00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:52.335
and his ideas for what the character looks like,

00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:54.068
and it's just amazing.

00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:56.610
MATT: Long may he reign.
LAURA: Thank you to McFarlane Toys,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.900
check out this limited edition Molly figurine.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.066
SAM: We've got toys!

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:01.694
LAURA: What!
TALIESIN: This is all I ever wanted.

00:05:01.694 --> 00:05:03.227
(laughter)
Right here.

00:05:03.227 --> 00:05:04.060
MATT: So exciting.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.067
LIAM: Holy crap!

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:06.947
TALIESIN: If I knew I just had to traumatize our audience

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:08.836
to get an action figure, I would've done it earlier.

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:10.837
(laughter)

00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:13.252
MATT: It's all it took the whole time!

00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:15.090
TALIESIN: Thank you for your pain, everybody.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.107
(laughter)

00:05:17.107 --> 00:05:20.097
MATT: Cool, I think that is the end of our announcements.

00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:20.930
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.821
MATT: Much shorter this week than last week.

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.617
And as such, I think it's time to go ahead

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:28.444
and jump into tonight's episode of

00:05:28.444 --> 00:05:30.934

MATT: And welcome back.

00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:12.503
So last we left off:

00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:17.502
The Mighty Nein, after helping aid the negotiation

00:07:17.502 --> 00:07:20.382
between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire

00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:22.782
come to a momentary close.

00:07:22.782 --> 00:07:24.798
You separated yourselves to head

00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:27.759
around the island of Urukayxl and the Inkclaw Reef,

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.236
making your way towards Rumblecusp,

00:07:29.236 --> 00:07:31.451
where you had planned in the near future,

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.932
to hold Traveler Con.
LAURA: Woo!

00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:37.607
MATT: Along the way, you drew the
attention of a dangerous entity

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:39.707
in the sea, what turned out to be a dragon turtle,

00:07:39.707 --> 00:07:42.877
a massive, massive threat.

00:07:42.877 --> 00:07:46.127
You managed to keep it at bay, fire towards it,

00:07:46.127 --> 00:07:47.527
only sustained a bit of damage to your hull

00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:49.307
before miraculously transforming it

00:07:49.307 --> 00:07:52.908
into a regular sea turtle, and then eventually a sea slug,

00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:54.616
leaving it in your wake,

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:57.687
literally, and heading a bit off course,

00:07:57.687 --> 00:07:58.917
taking a little more time in your travel,

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:02.408
but eventually making your way to the island of Rumblecusp,

00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:04.707
unscathed any further.

00:08:04.707 --> 00:08:06.867
Upon planting yourself on the outskirts of the island,

00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:08.707
and taking your ships to the shore,

00:08:08.707 --> 00:08:11.267
you began to-- you left the rest of the crew there,

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:13.987
on the beach, to keep an eye,

00:08:13.987 --> 00:08:17.677
while you began to enter the jungle proper.

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:21.917
There, within the tangled tree mass-- What? What did I miss?

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:23.097
TRAVIS: No, no, I'm just thinking,

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:24.807
I'm regretting leaving them on the shore.

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:27.795
We should have told them to hide or some shit!

00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:31.011
MATT: I'm sure it's fine.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.417
MARISHA: I forgot about them. Anyway.

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:35.427
MATT: Heading into the jungles,

00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:40.427
a short time in, you found yourselves being hunted.

00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:44.297
And as these creatures, these black, panther-like beasts,

00:08:44.297 --> 00:08:46.117
you've seen before in the past,

00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:50.077
began to present themselves, ready to pounce, and attack.

00:08:50.077 --> 00:08:53.572
They themselves were assaulted by a small hunting party,

00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:56.464
of two individuals in appeared to be

00:08:56.464 --> 00:08:59.647
a semi-humanoid-bear state.

00:08:59.647 --> 00:09:01.247
Upon killing one of these creatures,

00:09:01.247 --> 00:09:02.407
and sending the other scattering,

00:09:02.407 --> 00:09:05.587
they began to prepare it for

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:08.507
bringing back to their village, which you discovered

00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:12.012
exists in this island, a commune known as Vo,

00:09:12.012 --> 00:09:14.117
and they were eager to tell you about it,

00:09:14.117 --> 00:09:16.737
they were excited to meet newcomers to the island,

00:09:16.737 --> 00:09:18.827
and to show you the safest route

00:09:18.827 --> 00:09:21.977
back to the place that they call home.

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:25.097
These individuals, named Pono and Jaina,

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:28.817
carried the corpse of this displacer beast

00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:31.825
and alongside you, you are brought to this

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:36.825
makeshift, driftwood, patchwork

00:09:37.349 --> 00:09:39.257
village.

00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:41.437
Some buildings looking much older than others,

00:09:41.437 --> 00:09:44.209
you can see large bridge networks that connected

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.297
different structures, held aloft at different points

00:09:47.297 --> 00:09:49.817
in the few trees that still remain in this clearing,

00:09:49.817 --> 00:09:53.517
in the center of this dense jungle on Rumblecusp.

00:09:53.517 --> 00:09:56.497
People who lived here begin to come out excitedly

00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:59.500
and whisper about the new arrivals,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.027
until eventually you are brought to bear,

00:10:02.027 --> 00:10:05.457
and meet two of the three leaders of this village,

00:10:05.457 --> 00:10:10.457
one of which is a tall, lanky, male orc figure,

00:10:10.727 --> 00:10:14.277
with gray skin, bright smile,

00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:16.487
multiple tools hanging from his belt,

00:10:16.487 --> 00:10:18.712
that clangle as he walks,

00:10:18.712 --> 00:10:20.287
his hair pulled back into braids,

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:23.470
to about the midpoint of his back,

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.042
and a half-elf woman that you saw

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:29.697
being brought down by a cluster of moving vines

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:32.717
from atop a structure higher up in the tree.

00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:35.820
This half-elf female, tan of skin,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.173
sun-bleached, long, wild hair,

00:10:38.173 --> 00:10:42.280
with a leg made of vines, it looks like,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.279
steps down onto the ground,

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:46.596
and approaches before saying,

00:10:46.596 --> 00:10:50.496
"Welcome, so what brings you here?"

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.409
SAM: (audible nervous swallow)

00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:54.727
MATT: A moment of silence comes over as

00:10:54.727 --> 00:10:56.287
everyone is now waiting with baited breath

00:10:56.287 --> 00:11:00.177
to hear what the newcomers have to say.

00:11:00.177 --> 00:11:01.010
LAURA: Well,

00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:07.864
we were hoping to have a festival here.

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:13.717
We heard beautiful things about Rumblecusp,

00:11:13.717 --> 00:11:16.030
and how tropical and fabulous it was,

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.667
and we thought maybe we should

00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:22.143
just have a bunch of people worship a god.

00:11:22.143 --> 00:11:26.307
It's not your god, but it's our god named the Traveler.

00:11:27.607 --> 00:11:31.507
MATT: The woman named Viridian turns and looks to Lukash,

00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:34.947
and he gives a quirky grin in her direction.

00:11:34.947 --> 00:11:37.615
And she looks back towards you,

00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:42.277
"I'm curious

00:11:42.277 --> 00:11:45.797
"about the ramifications of bringing

00:11:45.797 --> 00:11:50.585
"a god to an island that already is home to one,

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:56.140
"but we can certainly discuss the possibilities.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.737
"But this is your reason for coming, you say?"

00:11:58.737 --> 00:12:01.937
TRAVIS: It is. Unfortunately, we weren't aware

00:12:01.937 --> 00:12:04.917
that there was civilization on this island.

00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:07.287
I'm afraid none of us were familiar with Rumblecusp

00:12:07.287 --> 00:12:10.237
prior to landing here.

00:12:10.237 --> 00:12:11.667
MATT: "That's all right."

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:16.667
LAURA: But good news is, the Traveler is super cool,

00:12:17.057 --> 00:12:20.647
and super likable, and everybody that meets him

00:12:20.647 --> 00:12:21.887
thinks he's really great,

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:23.675
so I'm sure

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:28.334
Vokodo will like him, too.

00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:31.207
MATT: "Perhaps."

00:12:31.207 --> 00:12:33.587
TALIESIN: We also got chased here by a giant turtle,

00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:34.907
I don't know if that's relevant,

00:12:34.907 --> 00:12:37.897
but it's all I've been thinking about for a while now.

00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:41.107
MATT: "A giant turtle, you say?"
TALIESIN: There was a giant turtle!

00:12:41.107 --> 00:12:42.357
MARISHA: A giant dragon turtle--

00:12:42.357 --> 00:12:43.697
TALIESIN: Oh that, yeah.
MARISHA: -- to be specific.

00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:46.387
ASHLEY: It was like a moving island.

00:12:46.387 --> 00:12:47.989
MATT: "And it followed you here?"

00:12:47.989 --> 00:12:48.822
SAM: No!

00:12:48.822 --> 00:12:51.306
TALIESIN: No, we gave chase, we got way away from it.

00:12:51.306 --> 00:12:54.990
LAURA: It's just definitely looking for us, but--

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.597
LIAM: We gave it the slip.

00:12:56.597 --> 00:12:58.727
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:00.697
MATT: You can see Viridian think for second,

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:04.227
then turn and look off to one section of the village there,

00:13:04.227 --> 00:13:05.907
and there are handful of individuals,

00:13:05.907 --> 00:13:08.967
look like they're wearing some fishing-based attire.

00:13:08.967 --> 00:13:10.919
Which of you speak Elven?

00:13:12.597 --> 00:13:13.917
Anybody here speak Elven?
TRAVIS: Cool!

00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:15.537
MARISHA: I think so.
TRAVIS: Oh good!

00:13:15.537 --> 00:13:17.057
SAM: Thank heavens.
MATT: Okay.

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:18.500
You got one!

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.737
LAURA: Do you still have Tongues activated?

00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:21.667
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Tight.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.177
LIAM: Well, not activated, but I have it.

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:25.050
MATT: He has it prepared.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.972
TALIESIN: I speak Elvish.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.879
MATT: Yeah, so you hear Viridian shout off to them,

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:30.987
"Gather the fishers.

00:13:30.987 --> 00:13:32.907
"Go ahead and locate the beach where they arrived,

00:13:32.907 --> 00:13:37.652
"and keep an eye for anything untoward making its way."

00:13:39.007 --> 00:13:41.147
Viridian turns the attention back,

00:13:42.597 --> 00:13:45.617
"I apologize, we are but two of three here at the moment,

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.727
"as the hunters are still returning

00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:50.687
"before the sun vanishes on the horizon.

00:13:51.867 --> 00:13:54.717
"There is not much in the way of decisions we can make

00:13:54.717 --> 00:13:57.467
"without a full quorum,

00:13:57.467 --> 00:14:01.208
"but there is to be a meal tonight.

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:02.507
"We can prepare a place.

00:14:02.507 --> 00:14:07.507
"If you are to stay, we can give you shelter to sleep,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.487
"and we can get to know each other,

00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:15.107
"over a roaring fire, here safe in our village."

00:14:15.107 --> 00:14:17.634
LIAM: We would graciously accept your hospitality.

00:14:17.634 --> 00:14:19.687
LAURA: (breathes) Hah-hah!

00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:20.520
MATT: "Are you all right?"

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.717
LIAM: Is that an anime gasp?

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:23.437
LAURA: I had to sneeze.

00:14:23.437 --> 00:14:26.137
SAM: It's good, it's good, it's good.

00:14:26.137 --> 00:14:27.857
Just in case, right?

00:14:27.857 --> 00:14:29.917
TRAVIS: I'm afraid we've been quite rude, actually.

00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:31.607
We didn't introduce ourselves.

00:14:31.607 --> 00:14:33.432
We are The Mighty Nein.

00:14:33.432 --> 00:14:35.817
We are a group of adventurers.

00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:39.997
You said "safe." Is it become much more dangerous

00:14:39.997 --> 00:14:42.884
when the sun goes down?

00:14:42.884 --> 00:14:43.957
MATT: "No, it's,

00:14:46.057 --> 00:14:48.527
"sometimes as dangerous, depending on where you go.

00:14:48.527 --> 00:14:50.554
"The island itself is a

00:14:51.751 --> 00:14:52.584
"a strange

00:14:55.451 --> 00:14:58.492
"collection, if you will.

00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:04.127
"You've come straight here, yes?"

00:15:04.127 --> 00:15:06.797
LAURA: Like, what do you mean? Like, from where?

00:15:06.797 --> 00:15:09.857
TALIESIN: That's a very broad question.
LAURA: Because--

00:15:09.857 --> 00:15:12.560
TRAVIS: No, we haven't come straight here,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.260
we were actually

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.227
just east of Urukayxl,

00:15:20.227 --> 00:15:23.473
before arriving at this island, just west,

00:15:23.473 --> 00:15:26.189
southeast, sorry.

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:28.157
MARISHA: All the directions.

00:15:28.157 --> 00:15:29.282
TALIESIN: We get around.

00:15:30.987 --> 00:15:35.260
MATT: "Well, here on this island, among the Vo,

00:15:36.177 --> 00:15:40.340
"as it is the central focus of the world around us,

00:15:41.547 --> 00:15:43.447
"it is home to many strange slivers

00:15:43.447 --> 00:15:45.987
"of different parts of the world, as well,

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.905
"that create this landmass.

00:15:49.087 --> 00:15:51.727
"Beneath the trees, there are odd landmarks

00:15:51.727 --> 00:15:56.367
"that claim shelter to other dangerous beasts

00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:59.762
"that may be a surprise to find here on the ocean.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:04.427
"A number of unnatural, dangerous denizens.

00:16:04.427 --> 00:16:05.857
"We've lost many through the generations

00:16:05.857 --> 00:16:08.167
"to some of these hazards,

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:12.347
"predators, but so long as the scouting and hunting parties

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:13.977
"are keeping watch,

00:16:13.977 --> 00:16:18.977
"and I am able to defend this village,

00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:20.868
"we endure

00:16:20.868 --> 00:16:23.739
"under the light of our god."

00:16:24.787 --> 00:16:27.477
TRAVIS: You said "through the generations,"

00:16:27.477 --> 00:16:31.704
do mind if we ask how long you've been on this island?

00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:35.887
MATT: "I myself have only been for close to three decades,

00:16:35.887 --> 00:16:40.147
"personally, but we've had at least 10-11 generations,

00:16:40.147 --> 00:16:44.617
"I believe, since the village began."

00:16:44.617 --> 00:16:49.117
TRAVIS: And where were you before being on the island?

00:16:50.187 --> 00:16:52.029
MATT: "It's interesting.

00:16:52.877 --> 00:16:54.727
"There is something about this island,

00:16:55.967 --> 00:16:58.059
"that gives and takes away.

00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:00.817
"By finding your destiny here,

00:17:00.817 --> 00:17:03.072
"and being a part of the

00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:08.477
"important presence of Vokodo,

00:17:08.477 --> 00:17:10.627
"and keeping these people safe,

00:17:10.627 --> 00:17:15.515
"and gathering from the island's many rewards and boons,

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:18.607
"it also takes from you the things

00:17:18.607 --> 00:17:20.687
"that are less important in life.

00:17:20.687 --> 00:17:24.557
"So many, if not most of us,

00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:29.459
"don't quite recall where we were from.

00:17:31.157 --> 00:17:33.907
"But in the long run, that's not as important, anyway."

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:37.227
LAURA: Do you remember, like, any locations at all in general?

00:17:37.227 --> 00:17:39.217
Or do you just not remember where you're from?

00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:42.637
Like, does anything exist outside of the island here?

00:17:42.637 --> 00:17:47.177
MATT: "I mean, the greater world of Exandria, yes."

00:17:49.797 --> 00:17:52.987
TRAVIS: Nations, ruling parties,

00:17:52.987 --> 00:17:54.939
powerships?
MARISHA: Continents?

00:17:54.939 --> 00:17:55.977
MATT: "The--"

00:17:55.977 --> 00:17:57.907
And you can see, like, a lot of folks around there,

00:17:57.907 --> 00:17:58.827
Lukash as well,

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:00.727
they're all racking their minds a bit,

00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:04.835
and there's a communal

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:08.667
hint of cloudy confusion.

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:12.967
And you gather, rather rapidly, that probably not.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.317
LAURA: Wow.

00:18:14.317 --> 00:18:17.627
LIAM: Do you yourself remember why you came to this island?

00:18:19.107 --> 00:18:20.327
MATT: "I do not.

00:18:20.327 --> 00:18:22.630
"Many of us here

00:18:23.527 --> 00:18:25.767
"have a hard time recalling.

00:18:25.767 --> 00:18:27.347
"Some, it's by shipwreck,

"some, it's by curiosity,

"most, it's by fate."

00:18:33.927 --> 00:18:35.037
And she looks and smiles,

00:18:35.037 --> 00:18:38.567
and everyone agrees, and nods.

00:18:38.567 --> 00:18:40.467
"But for whatever reasons we come here,

00:18:41.957 --> 00:18:44.677
"some go, but most stay."

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.907
ASHLEY: So if you wanted to leave, you could leave?

00:18:48.907 --> 00:18:50.887
MATT: "We're not keeping you here, by any means."

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:56.897
MARISHA: Who was the last person
who left, that you can remember?

00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:00.625
MATT: "It's hard to recall."

00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:03.321
SAM: (laughs)

00:19:03.321 --> 00:19:04.917
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:19:04.917 --> 00:19:08.217
MATT: There's a sense of embarrassment.

00:19:08.217 --> 00:19:10.867
You get the idea, based on the reactions,

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:12.867
you especially, and you both being

00:19:12.867 --> 00:19:15.000
generally very insightful folk,

00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:18.747
these are questions, or attempts at recollection

00:19:18.747 --> 00:19:21.692
that probably don't happen too often,

00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:23.327
or haven't for a very long time,

00:19:23.327 --> 00:19:26.497
and so they're in the midst of preparing to answer

00:19:26.497 --> 00:19:28.227
and then realizing they don't have one.

00:19:28.227 --> 00:19:30.982
TALIESIN: What was the level of sincerity on

00:19:30.982 --> 00:19:33.617
"Of course you can leave"?

00:19:33.617 --> 00:19:35.283
MATT: It seemed sincere.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:36.699
MATT: Best that you can tell.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:40.937
MATT: With your ridiculous passive insight.

00:19:40.937 --> 00:19:43.687
TALIESIN: Suck it, DM.

00:19:43.687 --> 00:19:47.237
TRAVIS: We're certainly interested
in you assembling your quorum,

00:19:47.237 --> 00:19:52.220
not to be too forward, your deity, this Vokodo,

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:54.837
are they a benevolent god,

00:19:54.837 --> 00:19:56.637
are they interested in meeting outsiders,

00:19:56.637 --> 00:20:00.613
or is it more of an inner-circle type of thing?

00:20:00.613 --> 00:20:01.934
MATT: "I do not know.

00:20:05.187 --> 00:20:08.757
"Those who come to Vo do meet at least once,

00:20:08.757 --> 00:20:10.127
"but the path is treacherous,

00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:14.747
"and the journey is one of acceptance on Vokodo's behalf,

00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:18.779
"not one that can be forced, necessarily.

00:20:20.297 --> 00:20:24.727
"I myself make treks to and from
the interior of the mountain

00:20:24.727 --> 00:20:27.517
"to meet with Vokodo fairly often,

00:20:27.517 --> 00:20:28.505
"and it's between these--"

00:20:28.505 --> 00:20:30.669
LAURA: What does Vokodo look like?

00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:33.230
MATT: "Vokodo--

00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:38.607
"is the mountain, and yet is a projection

00:20:38.607 --> 00:20:41.857
"of its essence within the mountain.

00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:44.937
"You see fire and flame, but there is water.

00:20:44.937 --> 00:20:49.267
"There are caverns woven, plants, a place of life,

00:20:49.267 --> 00:20:52.687
"brimming with creation within,

00:20:52.687 --> 00:20:55.804
"within the midst of that, is where Vokodo is."

00:20:56.797 --> 00:21:00.237
SAM: Do you think if your triumvirate

00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:02.547
would agree to our proposal,

00:21:02.547 --> 00:21:07.544
that you would also need
permission from Vokodo itself?

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.427
MATT: "That would be the only permission you require."

00:21:10.427 --> 00:21:12.027
SAM: Ah, got it.

00:21:12.027 --> 00:21:14.592
MATT: "We have no issue, though I cannot confirm that

00:21:14.592 --> 00:21:16.547
"unless we are, of course, the quorum required.

00:21:16.547 --> 00:21:18.935
"We will await Terra before we can make

00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:22.197
"such sweeping decisions."

00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:24.617
SAM: Sure, no we function much the same.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.927
We make all our decisions together,

00:21:27.927 --> 00:21:30.707
and usually Caleb decides, though,

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.917
because he's sort of the leader of the group.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.837
MATT: "And you are Caleb, then?"

00:21:34.837 --> 00:21:37.135
LIAM: My name is Caleb Widogast, yes.

00:21:39.576 --> 00:21:41.164
I'm curious to know,

00:21:41.164 --> 00:21:44.381
are you aware of any other peoples on this island?

00:21:46.987 --> 00:21:50.179
MATT: "There are, and have been some."

00:21:55.165 --> 00:21:56.551
TRAVIS: (deep voice) We hate them!

00:21:56.551 --> 00:21:59.267
(laughter)

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:02.917
MATT: "There have been some wandering,

00:22:04.527 --> 00:22:07.180
"unscrupulous ships,

00:22:08.191 --> 00:22:12.122
"that have come to pry previously.

00:22:13.727 --> 00:22:15.127
"Pirates, if you will.

00:22:16.017 --> 00:22:17.789
"Some attempted to use the island

00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:19.290
"to stash materials.

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:21.727
"Sometimes they met a terrible end

00:22:21.727 --> 00:22:24.367
"by the dangerous denizens in the island

00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:26.657
"that they themselves were not prepared for,

00:22:26.657 --> 00:22:28.977
"and did not come to us for protection beforehand.

00:22:29.887 --> 00:22:32.867
"Those that did survive, were found as first,

00:22:32.867 --> 00:22:34.667
well--" and Viridian points over

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:36.685
to another side of the group over there,

00:22:36.685 --> 00:22:38.492
and you can see there's three individuals,

00:22:38.492 --> 00:22:41.297
look pretty scrappy and scarred up.

00:22:41.297 --> 00:22:43.777
Based on the missing teeth, and the

00:22:43.777 --> 00:22:45.727
rather intense demeanor, you can see

00:22:45.727 --> 00:22:47.977
they probably spent a harsh life at sea.

00:22:49.097 --> 00:22:50.957
And based on your experience,

00:22:50.957 --> 00:22:53.106
you can see some of the tattoos that mark

00:22:53.106 --> 00:22:55.072
elements of the...

00:22:56.422 --> 00:22:58.922
symbols, or older symbols of Darktow.

00:23:02.597 --> 00:23:05.849
MARISHA: Brooding-- oh sorry. Go ahead.
MATT: "So, some stay."

00:23:07.957 --> 00:23:11.717
MARISHA: Sorry, yeah I was just
curious because you mentioned

00:23:11.717 --> 00:23:16.075
this island containing slivers of

00:23:16.075 --> 00:23:17.675
land and...

00:23:19.837 --> 00:23:21.484
from all over.

00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:25.249
Could you elaborate on what you mean by that?

00:23:26.467 --> 00:23:27.683
MATT: "Well,

00:23:30.237 --> 00:23:32.547
"there are pockets of this island

00:23:32.547 --> 00:23:34.422
"that provide different bounties.

00:23:35.277 --> 00:23:37.817
"There is, for instance, the Winding Core,

00:23:37.817 --> 00:23:40.537
"which is the most abundant home,

00:23:40.537 --> 00:23:42.717
"where we mine from the very island itself

00:23:42.717 --> 00:23:45.649
"the beautiful gems and diamonds,

00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:50.037
"and various gifts from the land

00:23:50.037 --> 00:23:53.447
"that we can refine, and thus bring to Vokodo

00:23:53.447 --> 00:23:57.324
"as part of the worship and love that we offer.

00:23:59.687 --> 00:24:04.687
"There are other places, such as the Shaded Tangle,

00:24:05.007 --> 00:24:08.337
"which lies along the path towards the entrance

00:24:08.337 --> 00:24:11.137
"to Vokodo's lair within the mountain itself.

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:16.267
"A cold place, where color seems to be muted,

00:24:16.267 --> 00:24:18.175
"where the mists grow cold.

00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:23.497
"There is the Ruin, far to the north,

00:24:23.497 --> 00:24:25.971
"on the other side of the mountain.

00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:30.721
"Structures strange, and not from anywhere in Exandria

00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:32.807
"that I've encountered or can recall."

00:24:32.807 --> 00:24:34.675
SAM: Ooh!

00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:36.703
That sounds interesting!

00:24:36.703 --> 00:24:41.372
MATT: "And to the northeast,
"there are the Heaven Falls,

00:24:42.967 --> 00:24:46.560
"which is still a mystery to our people.

00:24:48.207 --> 00:24:49.542
"Many strange locations,

00:24:49.542 --> 00:24:53.817
"but there are many strange locations in Exandria, yes?"

00:24:53.817 --> 00:24:56.024
SAM: Yes, yes!
MATT: "It's the density here,

00:24:56.024 --> 00:24:59.071
"as you grow closer to the core of this world,

00:24:59.987 --> 00:25:01.712
"where everything begins to...

00:25:02.757 --> 00:25:05.707
"become a bit jumbled,

00:25:05.707 --> 00:25:07.698
"if you will."

00:25:07.698 --> 00:25:09.457
SAM: How long would you say it would take

00:25:09.457 --> 00:25:10.720
to get to some of these places?

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.135
Can you walk around the whole island in a day, or--?

00:25:14.135 --> 00:25:17.487
MATT: "In a few days to reach the northern

00:25:17.487 --> 00:25:20.417
"shore, based on being careful.

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:23.678
"It's about a seven to eight hour journey

00:25:23.678 --> 00:25:27.482
"to the base of Rumblecusp itself,

00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:30.297
"and to the entrance to the lairs.

"A couple of days, maybe, to the Heaven Falls.

00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:36.219
"It also depends on how many are going,

"and under what means, because

00:25:39.194 --> 00:25:41.809
"you want to remain safe and remain unseen."

00:25:42.797 --> 00:25:46.907
TRAVIS: Those beasts that Pono and Jaina helped,

00:25:48.107 --> 00:25:51.067
"Jahna," "Jayna"?
LIAM: "Jayna," yep.

00:25:51.067 --> 00:25:52.955
TRAVIS: But Pono, right, I wrote that down right?

00:25:52.955 --> 00:25:55.185
SAM: Yeah!
TRAVIS: Pono!

00:25:55.185 --> 00:25:57.871
Are there more of those types of beasts out there,

00:25:57.871 --> 00:26:00.594
or are there all manner of dangerous creatures as well?

00:26:00.594 --> 00:26:04.161
MATT: "Oh, there are more of those,
and all manner of beasts, yes."

00:26:05.162 --> 00:26:07.367
SAM: Well-- oh.
LAURA: This one's important.

00:26:07.367 --> 00:26:08.238
SAM: Yeah, go, go!

00:26:08.238 --> 00:26:10.694
LAURA: Have you always been
able to use vines like that?

00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:13.672
Was that a thing that was
given to you here, or what?

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:16.905
TRAVIS: What do you mean, like use vines how?
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:19.170
MATT: "Many of us have different gifts.

00:26:20.087 --> 00:26:22.024
"The children that grow up here

"origins.

"But I've always known how to do this,

00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:40.317
"just as they've always known

"how to embrace the animalistic nature,"

00:26:42.247 --> 00:26:43.887
and points over towards Jaina and Pono,

00:26:43.887 --> 00:26:45.220
as you pointed them out.

00:26:48.157 --> 00:26:50.840
SAM: So this place is like the Bermuda Triangle.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.217
TRAVIS: Uh-huh!
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:26:52.217 --> 00:26:54.317
SAM: Mixed with, like, Professor Xavier's?

00:26:54.317 --> 00:26:57.097
LAURA: That's what I was thinking, too!

00:26:57.097 --> 00:27:00.059
SAM: And the island from Lost.
ASHLEY: Island of Dr. Moreau?

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:01.377
No. This is much better.

00:27:01.377 --> 00:27:02.675
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:27:02.675 --> 00:27:06.787
SAM: Well, we are certainly
fortunate to come across you

00:27:07.767 --> 00:27:10.727
for protection and for information.

00:27:10.727 --> 00:27:14.497
We are grateful, and we'll do anything

00:27:14.497 --> 00:27:17.017
in our power to return the favor.

00:27:17.017 --> 00:27:18.604
LAURA: Do we need to go to Vokodo,

00:27:18.604 --> 00:27:20.517
like, personally, and ask permission?

00:27:20.517 --> 00:27:23.792
Or is that something you're going to do for us, or what?

00:27:25.757 --> 00:27:28.617
MATT: "I would say if you had a chance

00:27:28.617 --> 00:27:32.477
"to appeal to Vokodo

LAURA: Well, it's pretty confusing,

00:27:47.795 --> 00:27:50.427
so I guess it would make sense that--

00:27:50.427 --> 00:27:52.687
What kind of stuff does Vokodo like?

00:27:52.687 --> 00:27:53.887
SAM: Gems, right?

00:27:53.887 --> 00:27:55.557
LAURA: Gems, like...?

00:27:55.557 --> 00:27:57.217
TRAVIS: Sparkly things.

00:27:57.217 --> 00:28:00.687
LIAM: And are they of the benevolent variety,

00:28:00.687 --> 00:28:04.185
or more wrathful, as a deity?

00:28:08.037 --> 00:28:11.125
MATT: "Just like any creature,

00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:14.315

00:28:46.987 --> 00:28:49.007
"wrath could occur."

00:28:49.007 --> 00:28:52.615
LIAM: I am caught on one particular word you used:

00:28:52.615 --> 00:28:54.623
sustenance.

00:28:54.623 --> 00:28:59.623
What is it that you tend to feed Vokodo?

00:28:59.845 --> 00:29:02.917
MATT: "Oh, a figure of speech.

00:29:02.917 --> 00:29:06.492
"Vokodo does not eat, but

00:29:06.492 --> 00:29:09.267
"amasses the bounty."

00:29:11.441 --> 00:29:12.274
LIAM: Okay.

00:29:12.274 --> 00:29:14.057
TRAVIS: Benevolent for the last 30 years,

00:29:14.057 --> 00:29:17.385
pretty good track record.
(laughter)

00:29:17.385 --> 00:29:18.747
SAM: Well, it's going to be fine,

00:29:18.747 --> 00:29:22.877
because we'll bring some nice gifties, some shinies.

00:29:22.877 --> 00:29:24.952
And we'll be okay.
LAURA: I guess we're going to have to go to

00:29:24.952 --> 00:29:28.907
the Winding Cove, and get some gems.

00:29:28.907 --> 00:29:32.157
SAM: We might have some on our personal ready.

00:29:32.157 --> 00:29:34.747
MATT: "The essence of preciousness."

00:29:34.747 --> 00:29:35.907
SAM: The essence of preciousness?

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:36.740
MATT: "Things that are precious."

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.587
MARISHA: So it doesn't, like, have to be

00:29:37.587 --> 00:29:40.217
locally sourced, or anything?

00:29:40.217 --> 00:29:44.037
MATT: "No, you carry amongst yourselves here

00:29:44.037 --> 00:29:47.727
"an incredible plethora of precious things,"

00:29:47.727 --> 00:29:49.827
and you look at yourselves and look around,

00:29:49.827 --> 00:29:50.660
and you begin to really notice,

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.717
like everybody around you is wearing

00:29:53.717 --> 00:29:57.487
tattered clothing, leathers, skins, hide,

00:29:57.487 --> 00:29:59.967
rusted chain, if any previous metal,

00:29:59.967 --> 00:30:03.592
and nothing else, no accessories.

00:30:03.592 --> 00:30:07.357
Bare bones, basic attire.

00:30:07.357 --> 00:30:11.427
Even everything you see around, there's no decor

00:30:11.427 --> 00:30:14.337
that brings it beyond anything functional.

00:30:14.337 --> 00:30:16.645
And you now realize all of you,

00:30:16.645 --> 00:30:19.317
in the ways that you dress, and the armor and equipment,

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:22.827
and magical enchantments that you carry,

00:30:22.827 --> 00:30:26.367
very much stand out like a sore thumb by comparison.

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:29.134
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast detect magic really quickly.

00:30:30.647 --> 00:30:34.324
MATT: Nothing, except for what's on you.

00:30:35.447 --> 00:30:37.897
TRAVIS: If we stop and think about it,

00:30:37.897 --> 00:30:39.557
can we recall how long it took us

00:30:39.557 --> 00:30:42.472
to get from the beach to where we are now?

00:30:42.472 --> 00:30:45.717
MATT: Yeah, it took you roughly-

00:30:45.717 --> 00:30:46.987
LIAM: Precisely.

00:30:46.987 --> 00:30:49.107
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:30:49.107 --> 00:30:51.547
Precisely!

00:30:51.547 --> 00:30:54.917
Four hours, 36 minutes, and 13 seconds.

00:30:54.917 --> 00:30:56.267
LIAM: Give or take a few seconds.

00:30:56.267 --> 00:30:58.885
TRAVIS: That's very impressive.
MATT: No, precisely.

00:30:58.885 --> 00:31:00.858
(laughter)

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:03.205
LIAM: I don't like to let them feel bad, you know.

00:31:03.205 --> 00:31:04.334
Fudge it a little bit.

00:31:04.334 --> 00:31:06.457
MATT: I understand.

00:31:06.457 --> 00:31:08.047
TRAVIS: So we haven't gotten hazy

00:31:08.047 --> 00:31:09.997
on how long we've been away from the beach?

00:31:09.997 --> 00:31:10.830
MATT: No.

00:31:12.497 --> 00:31:13.330
SAM: Well--
LAURA: When--

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.337
Oh, sorry.
SAM: Oh, no, go!

00:31:14.337 --> 00:31:15.170
LAURA: No, no.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.003
Jessie, just do your thing.
TRAVIS: You two!

00:31:16.003 --> 00:31:17.560
You're like of a mind, it's amazing.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.160
LAURA: I know, well yeah.
SAM: We know.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.934
(laughter)

00:31:21.934 --> 00:31:23.357
LAURA: How long did it take you to be here

00:31:23.357 --> 00:31:25.835
before you, like, lost your memory?

00:31:26.833 --> 00:31:29.747
(laughter)

00:31:29.747 --> 00:31:31.972
SAM: I think what she means is--

00:31:33.177 --> 00:31:34.277
no, that's what she means.

00:31:34.277 --> 00:31:36.777
LAURA: How long were you here before you started forgetting?

00:31:36.777 --> 00:31:39.337
MARISHA: That question is a trap, Jester.

00:31:39.337 --> 00:31:40.946
(laughter)

00:31:40.946 --> 00:31:42.646
TALIESIN: This is when they eat our faces.

00:31:44.177 --> 00:31:47.834
TRAVIS: Our faces!
TALIESIN: (screeching)

00:31:47.834 --> 00:31:49.427
TRAVIS: (screaming)

00:31:49.427 --> 00:31:52.797
MATT: There's a bit of an amused chuckle,

00:31:52.797 --> 00:31:56.867
and then an inward furrowing to the brow.

00:31:58.067 --> 00:32:01.000
And then it relaxes once more, and Viridian says,

00:32:03.507 --> 00:32:05.407
"The taking

00:32:05.407 --> 00:32:09.109
"of these unnecessary thoughts by the island,

00:32:10.487 --> 00:32:13.027
"I do not think there is a science to it.

00:32:13.027 --> 00:32:16.117
"Maybe it pertains to how much you give?

00:32:16.117 --> 00:32:17.697
"It is a trade.

00:32:17.697 --> 00:32:21.247
"Maybe it's a slow, natural element,

00:32:21.247 --> 00:32:23.484
"but I don't think

00:32:24.337 --> 00:32:26.771
"it's a refined science."

00:32:29.462 --> 00:32:32.732
LIAM: But you all are happy here, it seems.

00:32:32.732 --> 00:32:35.357
MATT: "Well," and she opens her hands a bit,

00:32:35.357 --> 00:32:38.147
and everyone around nods.

00:32:38.147 --> 00:32:39.427
LAURA: They don't know any better!

00:32:39.427 --> 00:32:41.407
TALIESIN: Well, this is a very impressive village,

00:32:41.407 --> 00:32:43.350
this is just amazing, I was going to say.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.617
MATT: Lukash is like, "Well, thank you very much,

00:32:45.617 --> 00:32:46.887
"we take a lot of pride what we've established here."

00:32:46.887 --> 00:32:49.017
TALIESIN: Oh you should, this is great,

00:32:49.017 --> 00:32:50.637
I wish I had something like this back at home.

00:32:50.637 --> 00:32:53.651
MATT: "Well, you could."
TALIESIN: This is a lot.

00:32:53.651 --> 00:32:56.247
Oh, well. (chuckles)

00:32:56.247 --> 00:32:57.467
Appreciate the offer.

00:32:57.467 --> 00:32:59.787
MATT: "Well, just stay a while, and see if,

00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:04.003
"no pressure, but this is a grand community,

00:33:04.003 --> 00:33:06.002
"filled with wonderful people."

00:33:06.002 --> 00:33:08.479
TRAVIS: Where we are on the island, is there a--

00:33:08.479 --> 00:33:11.380
are we able to see down and in the direction

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.007
of the beach that we left the ship at?

00:33:13.007 --> 00:33:15.507
Are we up on the side of the island at all?

00:33:15.507 --> 00:33:16.340
Any kind of a--?

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.090
MATT: Well, you're in a raised area,

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.640
but the tree cover here, the jungle trees

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.477
go from, like, 100-200 or more feet up.

00:33:23.477 --> 00:33:24.310
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.907
MATT: And the canopy is extremely dense.

00:33:25.907 --> 00:33:27.767
The only reason that you knew this village was here

00:33:27.767 --> 00:33:29.997
is because Frumpkin had seen it through the clearing.

00:33:29.997 --> 00:33:32.677
And even the clearing here, it's only elements of clearing,

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:33.877
because there are still trees

00:33:33.877 --> 00:33:35.347
in the middle of this opening,

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.767
but a lot of the lumber's been pulled out

00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:39.137
to build some of these structures,

00:33:39.137 --> 00:33:41.007
and to establish this place,

00:33:41.007 --> 00:33:43.457
as well as put up, like, a perimeter fence in areas.

00:33:44.587 --> 00:33:47.857
So yeah, all you can view is the elements of the mountain

00:33:47.857 --> 00:33:49.150
that manage to peek through,

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.313
in the afternoon light,

00:33:51.313 --> 00:33:52.347
and that's about it.

00:33:52.347 --> 00:33:54.477
LAURA: Are there any children here?

00:33:54.477 --> 00:33:55.417
MATT: There are children.

00:33:55.417 --> 00:33:58.207
You see, probably about a dozen or so children.

00:33:58.207 --> 00:34:00.174
SAM: That's good. They don't eat babies, that's good, yeah.

00:34:00.174 --> 00:34:01.765
LAURA: I know, I thought maybe that was, like,

00:34:01.765 --> 00:34:03.857
they're precious.
TRAVIS: The children are the old ones.

00:34:03.857 --> 00:34:06.137
(laughter)

00:34:06.137 --> 00:34:09.241
SAM: Well, is there a place
we can freshen up before din-din?

00:34:09.241 --> 00:34:13.967
MATT: "Ah, Lukash can probably take care of that.

00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:16.067
"I'm going to continue shoring up the perimeter,

00:34:16.067 --> 00:34:18.142
"and looking for Terra's arrival.

00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:23.142
"Sometimes her and her parties can bring a few stragglers

00:34:23.627 --> 00:34:25.377
"and we have to be prepared,

00:34:25.377 --> 00:34:27.935
"based on what attention they've drawn.

00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:29.837
"But, Lukash, if you don't mind."

00:34:29.837 --> 00:34:32.067
(as Lukash) "Oh, not to worry.

00:34:32.067 --> 00:34:35.657
"Friends, Mighty Nein, you say?

00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:39.377
"Right, this way, please, follow me."

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:43.687
And Lukash leads you off, through the village.

00:34:43.687 --> 00:34:45.167
People still follow from a distance

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:46.447
before slowly scattering off,

00:34:46.447 --> 00:34:48.167
going more about their business

00:34:48.167 --> 00:34:50.247
that they were already handling throughout the day.

00:34:52.297 --> 00:34:56.447
Eventually you come to a hollowed out tree trunk.

00:34:56.447 --> 00:34:58.324
The tree is cut off about 60 feet up,

00:34:58.324 --> 00:34:59.397
although looking at it,

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:01.752
it may not have cut off, more than it just fell,

00:35:01.752 --> 00:35:03.007
maybe was old and diseased,

00:35:03.007 --> 00:35:04.847
or burned at the top, or whatever it is,

00:35:04.847 --> 00:35:07.877
at about 50 feet up, if angles off,

00:35:07.877 --> 00:35:10.087
and the interior's completely hollowed out.

00:35:10.087 --> 00:35:11.747
As you step inside, underneath where the roots are,

00:35:11.747 --> 00:35:14.597
there's this nice little wooden door that pushes in,

00:35:14.597 --> 00:35:16.297
and it's a very humble,

00:35:16.297 --> 00:35:20.987
if somewhat cramped for the seven of you, abode.

00:35:20.987 --> 00:35:22.617
There's some basic furniture,

00:35:22.617 --> 00:35:25.797
some it looks like it was scavenged from a ship previously,

00:35:25.797 --> 00:35:27.957
based on the height and size of the stools.

00:35:27.957 --> 00:35:30.057
Some of it looks to be fashioned here.

00:35:30.057 --> 00:35:33.287
There are four beds, and

00:35:33.287 --> 00:35:37.508
some like cushions and basic blankets set up.

00:35:37.508 --> 00:35:40.430
The blankets are a little old, but they're functional.

00:35:41.437 --> 00:35:43.157
And as you're lead into it,

00:35:43.157 --> 00:35:44.577
you can see waiting off to the side,

00:35:44.577 --> 00:35:47.741
there's a family of dwarves

00:35:47.741 --> 00:35:49.537
that are just nodding to you

00:35:49.537 --> 00:35:52.357
and ushering you in.

00:35:52.357 --> 00:35:53.457
LAURA: Was this your house?

00:35:54.497 --> 00:35:57.307
MATT: "It was, but we're happy to
let you stay here for a while.

00:35:57.307 --> 00:35:58.647
"We've got some--"
LAURA: Oh, no, no, no!

00:35:58.647 --> 00:36:00.857
MATT: "We've got friends to shack up with."

00:36:00.857 --> 00:36:03.713
LAURA: We can have our own tent, we have tents!

00:36:03.713 --> 00:36:06.737
MATT: "It's our honor!

00:36:06.737 --> 00:36:08.887
"Please, it's an honor to have you stay here tonight."

00:36:08.887 --> 00:36:10.097
MARISHA: What's your name?
TRAVIS: It's just too much.

00:36:10.097 --> 00:36:13.497
MATT: "It's fine, really, honestly, don't worry about it.

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:15.548
"I'm Doron, this is my family.

00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:18.277
"And we stay here most times,

00:36:18.277 --> 00:36:19.767
"if anything, it'll be nice

00:36:19.767 --> 00:36:22.569
"to have a bit of a change of pace."

00:36:23.967 --> 00:36:26.777
TRAVIS: Lukash, this is of course extremely generous,

00:36:26.777 --> 00:36:28.597
is there anything we can do to help

00:36:28.597 --> 00:36:31.067
for the evening's festivities?

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:32.457
We can be of service.

00:36:32.457 --> 00:36:33.647
SAM: Yeah, we're good cooks,

00:36:33.647 --> 00:36:37.017
and we have some spices and teas and things.

00:36:37.017 --> 00:36:37.850
MATT: (as Lukash) "Perhaps."

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:39.935
LAURA: We're good musicians, too.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

00:36:41.407 --> 00:36:44.135
MATT: "Entertainment I think would be greatly appreciated.

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:46.207
"We only have a few musicians in the island,

00:36:46.207 --> 00:36:48.697
"and, if I want to be completely honest,

00:36:48.697 --> 00:36:51.446
"they're a little out of practice.

00:36:51.446 --> 00:36:52.495
"So that would wondrous!

00:36:52.495 --> 00:36:55.957
"We have some performing bards among you?"

00:36:55.957 --> 00:36:57.967
SAM: Yes, we have a band called, I think it's

00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:00.047
Yasha and the Orphan Makers, is that what?

00:37:00.047 --> 00:37:05.047
ASHLEY: Well, yes, but we are short a member of--

00:37:05.067 --> 00:37:06.375
TALIESIN: A flautist.

00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:09.627
LAURA: Maybe you can just scream along with the music,

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:12.327
because that's what it sounded like anyway.

00:37:12.327 --> 00:37:14.457
TALIESIN: I mean, it's just not the same.

00:37:14.457 --> 00:37:15.657
SAM: Well we're not short a flautist,

00:37:15.657 --> 00:37:17.525
we're short a flaut, a flute, right?

00:37:17.525 --> 00:37:19.547
TALIESIN: Yeah, flautist is alive and well.

00:37:19.547 --> 00:37:21.397
ASHLEY: Maybe they have something that you could play?

00:37:21.397 --> 00:37:24.297
We could definitely provide some entertainment

00:37:24.297 --> 00:37:25.647
to thank you.
MATT: "Wonderful.

00:37:25.647 --> 00:37:27.067
"And for those who wish to help with the meal

00:37:27.067 --> 00:37:31.827
"I can introduce you to Anola, who handles the mass cooking

00:37:31.827 --> 00:37:33.695
"for the village."

00:37:34.727 --> 00:37:37.157
TALIESIN: That might be where I am best put to service,

00:37:37.157 --> 00:37:39.367
to be honest, so.

00:37:39.367 --> 00:37:43.317
I would love to see what it is that everybody eats out here,

00:37:43.317 --> 00:37:44.797
I'm always excited by new food.

00:37:44.797 --> 00:37:46.587
MATT: "Of course, well."
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll join you, Cad.

00:37:46.587 --> 00:37:48.457
ASHLEY: Me too.
TALIESIN: Excellent.

00:37:48.457 --> 00:37:50.837
MATT: "Rest a while a bit,
I'll come get you when it's necessary.

00:37:50.837 --> 00:37:52.527
"We're still waiting for the hunting parties to return

00:37:52.527 --> 00:37:55.147
"before we can actually prepare the extent

00:37:55.147 --> 00:37:56.167
"of tonight's meal."
SAM: Oh, yes!

00:37:56.167 --> 00:37:59.428
ASHLEY: I actually did have a question,

00:37:59.428 --> 00:38:01.107
is it safe to be outside at night,

00:38:01.107 --> 00:38:03.787
or do you all generally stay indoors?

00:38:03.787 --> 00:38:06.929
MATT: "We generally try and stay within the village.

00:38:07.797 --> 00:38:09.897
"It's dangerous in some places,

00:38:09.897 --> 00:38:12.007
"regardless of the time of day.

00:38:12.007 --> 00:38:13.977
"But there are some nocturnal predators,

00:38:13.977 --> 00:38:14.957
"that we prefer to stay

00:38:14.957 --> 00:38:18.837
"within the protective arena of the village,

00:38:18.837 --> 00:38:20.587
"both at the watch of Terra

00:38:20.587 --> 00:38:22.701
"and the hunters upon their return,

00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:25.927
"who keep an eye in shifts throughout the night,

00:38:25.927 --> 00:38:30.095
"as well as Viridian and her sleepless talents with nature."

00:38:31.147 --> 00:38:34.535
TRAVIS: Lukash, was Pono and Jaina a part of

00:38:34.535 --> 00:38:35.767
Terra's hunting party,

00:38:35.767 --> 00:38:37.897
just on a separate area of the island?

00:38:37.897 --> 00:38:39.947
MATT: "Yes, there are multiple hunting parties,

00:38:39.947 --> 00:38:42.986
"but Terra oversees and organizes them before they go out,

00:38:42.986 --> 00:38:45.287
"as well as when the night is done,

00:38:45.287 --> 00:38:47.067
"calls them in and takes stock

00:38:47.067 --> 00:38:48.987
"of what they managed to acquire and haul."

00:38:48.987 --> 00:38:51.569
TRAVIS: Please extend our thanks;
they actually came to our aid

00:38:51.569 --> 00:38:54.807
as we were being besieged upon by those terrible beasts.

00:38:54.807 --> 00:38:58.008
MATT: "Yes, I saw them guiding you into the village.

00:38:58.008 --> 00:38:59.667
"They're good folk.

00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:04.667
"A bit ornery, depending on the weather, but effective.

00:39:04.868 --> 00:39:06.883
"Anyway, should you need anything,

00:39:06.883 --> 00:39:10.466
"just let someone in the vicinity know you look for Lukash.

00:39:10.466 --> 00:39:12.717
"In the meantime, rest, and I will retrieve you

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:16.687
"when the night has begun its planning cycle."

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.307
TRAVIS: Dinner around sundown?

00:39:18.307 --> 00:39:19.667
MATT: Yes.

00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:21.527
TRAVIS: But what time of day is it, Caleb?

00:39:21.527 --> 00:39:22.360
LIAM: Oh it's--

00:39:23.267 --> 00:39:25.337
MATT: You guys, you did shave some time off,

00:39:25.337 --> 00:39:28.117
you arrived around 10:00 or so in the morning,

00:39:28.117 --> 00:39:29.127
traveled to the village,

00:39:29.127 --> 00:39:31.237
and arrival and getting situated here,

00:39:31.237 --> 00:39:33.407
now it's about 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon, I'd say,

00:39:33.407 --> 00:39:34.307
give or take.

00:39:34.307 --> 00:39:38.347
So you have a handful of hours before sundown, so.

00:39:38.347 --> 00:39:40.107
SAM: Well, thank you, Lukash.
MATT: "Of course."

00:39:40.107 --> 00:39:43.446
LIAM: Are we free to wander the village?

00:39:43.446 --> 00:39:46.225
MATT: "Yes, I would recommend not wandering too far."

00:39:46.225 --> 00:39:48.907
LIAM: How far is no longer safe?

00:39:48.907 --> 00:39:50.097
MATT: "Where the tree line comes back."

00:39:50.097 --> 00:39:50.930
LIAM: All right.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.430
LAURA: What's with the mist?

00:39:54.587 --> 00:39:56.487
MATT: "It's misty."

00:39:56.487 --> 00:39:59.317
LAURA: Why is it misty?

00:40:00.837 --> 00:40:04.325
MATT: "Because it is, it's always been misty."

00:40:05.517 --> 00:40:07.837
LAURA: Is the mist dangerous?

00:40:07.837 --> 00:40:09.807
MATT: "No, but some dangerous things use the mist

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:13.467
"to not be seen, so maybe steer clear of it."

00:40:13.467 --> 00:40:14.877
LAURA: Okay.

00:40:14.877 --> 00:40:16.167
MATT: "All right.

00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:18.922
"See you all very soon."
SAM: (breathing) Hoo-ah!

00:40:18.922 --> 00:40:21.497
ASHLEY, TRAVIS, and LAURA: (breathing) Hoo-ah!

00:40:21.497 --> 00:40:23.215
TALIESIN: Hoo-ah?

00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:24.782
MATT: "Goodbye."
SAM: Goodbye.

00:40:24.782 --> 00:40:27.709
(laughter)

00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:29.646
TALIESIN: Is this a thing we're doing now?

00:40:29.646 --> 00:40:31.187
LAURA: So, you guys?

00:40:31.187 --> 00:40:34.828
SAM: So, wow, so much to unpack!
LAURA: This place is

00:40:34.828 --> 00:40:36.794
perfect for Traveler Con!

00:40:36.794 --> 00:40:38.277
SAM: This village?
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:40:38.277 --> 00:40:39.287
LAURA: Don't you think?

00:40:39.287 --> 00:40:40.527
LIAM: The village itself?

00:40:41.747 --> 00:40:42.997
What's the plan here?

00:40:42.997 --> 00:40:45.037
TRAVIS: We'll need more than a week to prepare

00:40:45.037 --> 00:40:48.628
for the arrival of all of your... acolytes?

00:40:48.628 --> 00:40:50.627
SAM: Also, we can't have it here!

00:40:50.627 --> 00:40:53.427
They'll become villagers forever!

00:40:53.427 --> 00:40:54.352
LAURA: Well that would be great,

00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:57.857
because the Traveler really doesn't
want that many followers.

00:40:57.857 --> 00:40:59.957
TRAVIS: Yeah, but, two things;

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:03.477
one, we should find out what this Vokodo is,

00:41:03.477 --> 00:41:06.163
and two, is anybody else worried about the ship?

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:08.477
TALIESIN: Yeah, a little bit, I think we should probably

00:41:08.477 --> 00:41:10.887
let them know that they are expecting visitors,

00:41:10.887 --> 00:41:11.927
and they should probably.
LAURA: I can send a message.

00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:14.957
TRAVIS: Or just hide, I feel like
they're going to burn the ship.

00:41:14.957 --> 00:41:16.867
SAM: Why would they burn the ship, they seem nice enough?

00:41:16.867 --> 00:41:18.533
TRAVIS: They said that nobody leaves-
MARISHA: They said pirates!

00:41:18.533 --> 00:41:19.967
TRAVIS: But that might also because they don't have

00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:21.687
the means to leave after they arrive.

00:41:21.687 --> 00:41:24.030
LAURA: We didn't mention that we have any crew, did we?

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.657
TRAVIS: We didn't.

00:41:25.657 --> 00:41:26.577
SAM: Maybe we did.

00:41:26.577 --> 00:41:28.892
MARISHA: But beyond that.
TRAVIS: I can't remember.

00:41:28.892 --> 00:41:30.273
LAURA: (gasps)

00:41:30.273 --> 00:41:32.317
SAM: Wait, what's your name again?

00:41:32.317 --> 00:41:33.567
SAM: What's your face?

00:41:33.567 --> 00:41:34.997
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Orly

00:41:34.997 --> 00:41:36.887
before I forget who Orly is.

00:41:36.887 --> 00:41:38.414
SAM: Oh actually, you know what?
LAURA: What?

00:41:38.414 --> 00:41:39.622
SAM: Caleb-- no, do that,

00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:41.297
but Caleb, you have a lot of paper,

00:41:41.297 --> 00:41:42.917
and writing implements, right?

00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:45.537
LIAM: I am actually out of paper, and need some.

00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:47.432
LAURA: Oh man, I was going to ask to use some of it!

00:41:47.432 --> 00:41:49.927
MARISHA: You're, like, always out of paper!

00:41:49.927 --> 00:41:51.667
We buy paper and then you're instantly out!

00:41:51.667 --> 00:41:52.769
LIAM: I go through it quickly.

00:41:52.769 --> 00:41:54.587
MARISHA: (scoffs)
LIAM: I'm efficient.

00:41:54.587 --> 00:41:56.774
MARISHA: Yeah, like an inkjet!

00:41:56.774 --> 00:41:59.307
SAM: Wait, I was just thinking, maybe,

00:41:59.307 --> 00:42:01.587
in case we start losing our memories,

00:42:01.587 --> 00:42:03.697
maybe we should write down a quick log

00:42:03.697 --> 00:42:06.587
of everything that's happened to us since we've been here.

00:42:06.587 --> 00:42:07.420
MARISHA: Oh, I mean, I'm already doing that.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.267
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, that's a really, that's right.

00:42:09.267 --> 00:42:11.387
SAM: For real, or is that Marisha?

00:42:11.387 --> 00:42:13.737
MARISHA: No, Beau also really does that.

00:42:13.737 --> 00:42:15.982
SAM: Okay, will you be in charge of that, Beau?

00:42:15.982 --> 00:42:17.124
MARISHA: Yeah, I can take notes.

00:42:17.124 --> 00:42:20.640
I wasn't walking and taking notes, but yeah.
LIAM: I also don't forget anything.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.447
SAM: Well, I know, but what if you do forget something?

00:42:22.447 --> 00:42:23.407
LIAM: No, but I don't.

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.320
MARISHA: But what if it's supernatural?
SAM: But what if you do?

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.447
MARISHA: Your brain can still be affect by things, man!

00:42:27.447 --> 00:42:29.317
TALIESIN: Well, why would you remember to find it in a book,

00:42:29.317 --> 00:42:30.867
then, after that?

00:42:30.867 --> 00:42:32.047
SAM: Jeez, we should write a note

00:42:32.047 --> 00:42:34.761
to remind us to look in the book.

00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:36.349
MARISHA: All right, that'll be my first note.

00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:37.727
Look in this book.

00:42:37.727 --> 00:42:40.875
TRAVIS: From our two clerics, do either of you have any

00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:43.087
experience with like--
LAURA: Greater Restoration!

00:42:43.087 --> 00:42:45.020
What?
TRAVIS: Diseases, or--

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.737
LAURA: Greater Restoration!
TALIESIN: Greater Restoration!

00:42:46.737 --> 00:42:48.067
I almost got it that time!

00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:50.437
LAURA: Yeah. Do have it prepared? Because I don't.

00:42:50.437 --> 00:42:52.557
TALIESIN: Yeah, probably, usually.

00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:53.967
LAURA: I mean, that makes sense that

00:42:53.967 --> 00:42:56.217
Clay would have it prepared.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got it.

00:42:56.217 --> 00:42:59.287
SAM: Would that get rid of a loss of memory?

00:42:59.287 --> 00:43:01.007
TALIESIN: Depends.
SAM: A magical curse of--?

00:43:01.007 --> 00:43:02.157
LAURA: It depends.
TALIESIN: Possibly, maybe.

00:43:02.157 --> 00:43:03.457
TRAVIS: And Wild Mother has also given me

00:43:03.457 --> 00:43:06.437
the ability to remove a poison or cure a disease,

00:43:06.437 --> 00:43:09.587
if this is a biological thing that this mist is doing,

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.267
so we could try that on one of the-

00:43:11.267 --> 00:43:14.087
TALIESIN: This seems more spooky-ookie.

00:43:14.087 --> 00:43:16.527
LAURA: This feels like--
MARISHA: I agree.

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:19.859
LAURA: -- like Modify Memory gone
really wrong or something, you know?

00:43:19.859 --> 00:43:21.783
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if--

00:43:21.783 --> 00:43:24.977
what if maybe they wanted to forget?

00:43:24.977 --> 00:43:26.231
MARISHA: That's what I was just thinking.

00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:29.507
ASHLEY: What if they came, something brought them here

00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:33.338
because they wanted to forget things from their former life?

00:43:33.338 --> 00:43:34.777
MARISHA: I mean, they're convinced that this place

00:43:34.777 --> 00:43:36.316
is the center of the universe.

00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:39.592
I feel like, eventually, you're just going to believe that,

00:43:39.592 --> 00:43:42.917
no matter what you're told.
LAURA: Everybody that comes here, stays.

00:43:42.917 --> 00:43:44.877
TRAVIS: Yeah, the percentages are just so high.

00:43:44.877 --> 00:43:46.637
LAURA: Does that mean all of us came here

00:43:46.637 --> 00:43:49.217
because we wanted to forget?

00:43:49.217 --> 00:43:52.394
TALIESIN: On the other end of it, I mean,

00:43:53.417 --> 00:43:56.150
they've got this Vokodo,

00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:00.547
who demands precious things,

00:44:00.547 --> 00:44:03.534
not things of worth, but things that are precious.

00:44:03.534 --> 00:44:05.487
And when you run out of precious things,

00:44:05.487 --> 00:44:08.897
what are you left with to give?

00:44:08.897 --> 00:44:11.177
LAURA: Yourself.
TALIESIN: Than yourself?

00:44:11.177 --> 00:44:13.435
Maybe that's what--

00:44:13.435 --> 00:44:14.701
Maybe that's what it takes.

00:44:14.701 --> 00:44:18.118
LAURA: Just eating at them, all the time?
TRAVIS: But it doesn't seem like most deities require

00:44:19.137 --> 00:44:20.231
material things?

00:44:20.231 --> 00:44:21.977
TALIESIN: I'm not convinced this is a deity.

00:44:21.977 --> 00:44:22.810
MARISHA: Me neither.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.587
It's got to be something else.
LAURA: I really want to meet him, though!

00:44:24.587 --> 00:44:26.737
LIAM: Yes, we are going to have many questions unanswered

00:44:26.737 --> 00:44:28.457
until we find this Vokodo.

00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:30.435
LAURA: What if it's just a giant avocado?

00:44:30.435 --> 00:44:32.137
(laughter)

00:44:32.137 --> 00:44:34.817
TALIESIN: That would be delicious.
TRAVIS: Like the kind you eat?

00:44:34.817 --> 00:44:35.967
LAURA: Yeah!

00:44:35.967 --> 00:44:36.800
LIAM: Avocoto?

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.163
TALIESIN: I'd never leave.

00:44:39.163 --> 00:44:41.127
TRAVIS: A giant av-- I can just see the drawing now.

00:44:41.127 --> 00:44:43.207
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Orly before I forget

00:44:43.207 --> 00:44:45.500
that I said I was going to send a message to Orly.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.967
MATT: Okay.

00:44:46.967 --> 00:44:48.987
LAURA: Orly!
TRAVIS: Avocado!

00:44:48.987 --> 00:44:52.207
LAURA: We found-- count this, Fjord.

00:44:52.207 --> 00:44:53.167
Count this.
TRAVIS: Count what?

00:44:53.167 --> 00:44:54.000
LAURA: She's sending a message.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.517
LAURA: Orly!
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:44:55.517 --> 00:44:58.472
TALIESIN: We found-- Fjord, count this.
LAURA: We found-- no!

00:44:58.472 --> 00:45:01.047
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:45:01.047 --> 00:45:02.937
LAURA: -- a village.

00:45:05.827 --> 00:45:08.547
The people here could be crazy,

00:45:08.547 --> 00:45:11.887
maybe you guys should hide.

00:45:11.887 --> 00:45:14.237
Also, they might

00:45:14.237 --> 00:45:18.131
try to destroy ship.

00:45:18.131 --> 00:45:21.199
(laughter)

00:45:21.199 --> 00:45:23.337
SAM: Well, they're not going to hide the ship!

00:45:23.337 --> 00:45:24.337
LAURA: Well no, I'm just saying,

00:45:24.337 --> 00:45:25.517
like, if they come and they're like,

00:45:25.517 --> 00:45:27.237
"We're going to destroy the ship because nobody's around,"

00:45:27.237 --> 00:45:29.677
then Orly and the crew can come out and be like, "Fuck you!"

00:45:29.677 --> 00:45:31.077
And then they can destroy the people.

00:45:31.077 --> 00:45:33.217
SAM: Orly and our crew? There's four people,

00:45:33.217 --> 00:45:34.907
and one of them's Marius!
TRAVIS: Marius is--

00:45:34.907 --> 00:45:38.847
LAURA: Marius is so tough!
SAM: Dead, they're dead!

00:45:38.847 --> 00:45:40.807
MATT: You do get a response from Orly.
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

00:45:40.807 --> 00:45:43.218
MATT: He goes,

00:45:43.218 --> 00:45:46.701
"Appreciate the heads up.

00:45:48.037 --> 00:45:49.485
"We're

00:45:49.485 --> 00:45:52.802
"m-m-mighty

00:45:52.802 --> 00:45:54.235
"well-hidden.

00:45:55.407 --> 00:45:57.119
"We'll keep an eye.

00:45:58.157 --> 00:46:00.927
"Woe be unto--" and he just trails off.

00:46:00.927 --> 00:46:03.067
(laughter)

00:46:03.067 --> 00:46:06.254
TRAVIS: "Woe be unto."
LAURA: I love him!

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:08.757
MARISHA: Okay.

00:46:08.757 --> 00:46:11.467
SAM: Okay, so we just go to dinner, what's the plan?

00:46:11.467 --> 00:46:13.999
We're going to, what?
LAURA: (gasps)

00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:14.832
SAM: What?

00:46:15.832 --> 00:46:19.957
LAURA: I can give the villagers tarot card readings!

00:46:19.957 --> 00:46:22.023
TALIESIN: I don't know what that's going to do.

00:46:22.023 --> 00:46:25.397
TRAVIS: Is that what we're going to do
for the next few hours?

00:46:25.397 --> 00:46:28.097
SAM: They seem like they're living in the moment.

00:46:28.097 --> 00:46:30.354
They've given up all worldly possessions,

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:31.817
and their memories.

00:46:31.817 --> 00:46:33.417
They're just living for the now,

00:46:33.417 --> 00:46:35.322
so I don't know if they would care about their future.

00:46:35.322 --> 00:46:36.577
TALIESIN: I think their past and future

00:46:36.577 --> 00:46:39.427
is all in the volcano at the moment.

00:46:39.427 --> 00:46:42.457
LAURA: Every card I pull is just a volcano!

00:46:42.457 --> 00:46:43.957
(laughter)

00:46:43.957 --> 00:46:46.667
TALIESIN: I don't-- I think they'll agree.

00:46:46.667 --> 00:46:49.177
TRAVIS: Do you remember how long he said it was to the-

00:46:49.177 --> 00:46:51.280
MATT: Yes!
(laughter)

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.797
TRAVIS: The Shaded Tangle, do we remember how long

00:46:52.797 --> 00:46:54.547
he said it was to get to that door?

00:46:55.897 --> 00:46:57.354
From here?

00:46:57.354 --> 00:46:58.317
LAURA: He said eight hours to get to the volcano.

00:46:58.317 --> 00:46:59.307
LIAM: Eight hours to the volcano,

00:46:59.307 --> 00:47:01.872
and the shady thing leads to, yeah.

00:47:01.872 --> 00:47:03.297
LAURA: I want to go to Heaven Falls!

00:47:03.297 --> 00:47:05.096
TALIESIN: Heaven Falls, or the Ruin.

00:47:05.096 --> 00:47:07.462
MARISHA: Heaven Falls was northeast.
LAURA: Both of those sound awesome!

00:47:07.462 --> 00:47:10.387
MARISHA: But those were further, and then the Ruins

00:47:10.387 --> 00:47:11.917
are on the far north side.

00:47:11.917 --> 00:47:13.617
LAURA: Yeah, and Heaven Falls is at the north, too,

00:47:13.617 --> 00:47:14.917
so we could hit up both!

00:47:14.917 --> 00:47:17.607
TALIESIN: The Ruins could also be, like, the ruins of

00:47:17.607 --> 00:47:19.417
an old hotel and convention center,

00:47:19.417 --> 00:47:20.250
could work out really well.
LAURA: I know!

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.420
MARISHA: You're not wrong.
LAURA: What if Heaven Falls is just like beautiful--

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.967
I mean, Heaven Falls, what if that's, like,

00:47:23.967 --> 00:47:25.687
the perfect place to hold a--?

00:47:25.687 --> 00:47:27.757
LIAM: I assumed we would be location scouting.

00:47:27.757 --> 00:47:28.590
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:32.037
LIAM: And find a proper place
for your guests to arrive and stay

00:47:32.037 --> 00:47:33.637
whether it's this village or somewhere else,

00:47:33.637 --> 00:47:35.487
and you want to get the lay of the land

00:47:35.487 --> 00:47:37.827
before you talk with the big cheese?

00:47:37.827 --> 00:47:38.660
LAURA: Yeah!

00:47:39.496 --> 00:47:42.677
I know, I got to tell him where to let everybody go!

00:47:42.677 --> 00:47:43.937
MARISHA: But that is an excellent point.

00:47:43.937 --> 00:47:47.057
I mean, this island is a lot bigger than we anticipated.

00:47:47.057 --> 00:47:49.907
How do we know how to direct people when they land?

00:47:49.907 --> 00:47:51.417
There could be beaches all around this island?

00:47:51.417 --> 00:47:53.897
LAURA: Well we say-- if we are going to Heaven Falls,

00:47:53.897 --> 00:47:57.904
we go, "Land on the north side of the beach."

00:47:57.904 --> 00:47:59.477
MARISHA: Have the Traveler disseminate?

00:47:59.477 --> 00:48:01.607
TRAVIS: How are you communicating this?

00:48:01.607 --> 00:48:02.897
LAURA: Because I'm going to tell the Traveler,

00:48:02.897 --> 00:48:04.257
and he's going to tell everyone.

00:48:04.257 --> 00:48:07.492
LIAM: I also can create some sort of a beacon

00:48:07.492 --> 00:48:10.777
for your fellow acolytes to come to.

00:48:10.777 --> 00:48:12.357
LAURA: Oh, so it can shoot up in the air or something?

00:48:12.357 --> 00:48:13.317
LIAM: Well yeah, I can put something in to-

00:48:13.317 --> 00:48:14.367
LAURA: Like search lights?

00:48:14.367 --> 00:48:16.047
SAM: Or we can make a bonfire, at least,

00:48:16.047 --> 00:48:18.037
with smoke coming up and?

00:48:18.037 --> 00:48:21.927
LAURA: Oh man, I put the banner at the other side!

00:48:21.927 --> 00:48:23.934
I have to go back and get the fucking banner.

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:25.757
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Just let that banner go.

00:48:25.757 --> 00:48:26.827
It's fine.
SAM: No, no wait,

00:48:26.827 --> 00:48:29.437
I have some stuff, too, that I should get,

00:48:29.437 --> 00:48:32.007
maybe we can have Marius run it up to us.

00:48:32.007 --> 00:48:33.347
MARISHA: We could just sail around the island.

00:48:33.347 --> 00:48:34.837
LAURA: Marius? Please.

00:48:34.837 --> 00:48:36.547
He would lose his memory in two seconds

00:48:36.547 --> 00:48:38.667
and be stuck here forever.

00:48:38.667 --> 00:48:39.547
MARISHA: Yeah, he does suck.

00:48:39.547 --> 00:48:41.740
SAM: Well, as long as he brought the stuff.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.975
LIAM: I can make you another banner, as well.

00:48:44.975 --> 00:48:46.590
LAURA: Oh.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:48:47.967 --> 00:48:50.877
TRAVIS: Marius still hasn't killed anyone, has he?

00:48:50.877 --> 00:48:52.237
MARISHA: No, he sucks, that's what I said!

00:48:52.237 --> 00:48:53.217
LAURA: No, he's fine, he's good.

00:48:53.217 --> 00:48:54.817
TALIESIN: Plenty of reasonable people I know

00:48:54.817 --> 00:48:55.949
haven't killed anybody.

00:48:55.949 --> 00:48:58.109
MARISHA: (scoffs)
TRAVIS: Name one.

00:48:59.067 --> 00:49:00.251
TALIESIN: Okay, that's a fair point.

00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:02.384
(laughter)

00:49:04.348 --> 00:49:05.307
LAURA: That's really sad.

00:49:05.307 --> 00:49:06.457
TRAVIS: I know, yes.
ASHLEY: It is sad.

00:49:06.457 --> 00:49:07.627
TRAVIS: We need to be better people.

00:49:07.627 --> 00:49:10.517
TALIESIN: I'm seriously worrying about a lot of decisions

00:49:10.517 --> 00:49:12.847
I made in my life.
(laughter)

00:49:12.847 --> 00:49:14.852
TRAVIS: Yes, but they were all bad.

00:49:14.852 --> 00:49:16.462
TALIESIN: I mean, it's rough out there.

00:49:17.397 --> 00:49:19.950
LAURA: What if we turn into giant birds,

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:21.727
and we just grab everyone, and we fly,

00:49:21.727 --> 00:49:24.097
and that way we don't have to walk across the island?

00:49:24.097 --> 00:49:25.617
And we can get there super fast!

00:49:25.617 --> 00:49:27.957
SAM: Grab everyone, you mean us, grab us?

00:49:27.957 --> 00:49:29.437
LAURA: Yeah!
SAM: Yeah, that sounds good.

00:49:30.597 --> 00:49:33.127
TALIESIN: Are we going to Wonder Twins
this, is that the plan?

00:49:33.127 --> 00:49:35.327
TRAVIS: Or you could just go and come back before dinner,

00:49:35.327 --> 00:49:36.524
unless you wanted to also

00:49:36.524 --> 00:49:40.492
scope out the Shaded Tangle entrance?

00:49:40.492 --> 00:49:44.476
TALIESIN: I'll also say:
I'm a little worried about eating the food.

00:49:44.476 --> 00:49:45.867
LAURA: I know, I am, too.

00:49:45.867 --> 00:49:48.357
MARISHA: Well, we volunteered to help cook,

00:49:48.357 --> 00:49:50.212
so we'll get a closer--
TALIESIN: That's why I did.

00:49:50.212 --> 00:49:52.557
SAM: Is it because of gluten?

00:49:52.557 --> 00:49:56.527
TALIESIN: I mean, that's a concern,
but I'm pretty sure I'm fine.

00:49:56.527 --> 00:49:57.493
No.
MARISHA: The avocado thing,

00:49:57.493 --> 00:49:58.493
makes sense.
TRAVIS: International food

00:49:58.493 --> 00:49:59.467
can be quite rewarding.

00:49:59.467 --> 00:50:00.787
You should really give it a try.

00:50:00.787 --> 00:50:03.349
TALIESIN: Considering that the only person who's eaten

00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:05.504
anything on this island so far is--

00:50:05.504 --> 00:50:08.737
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was a little tough to eat,

00:50:08.737 --> 00:50:13.145
but I think I'm very excited to try the food of the land.

00:50:13.145 --> 00:50:15.887
LAURA: Do you feel like it's going to give you the shits?

00:50:15.887 --> 00:50:16.720
ASHLEY: Say again?

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.817
TRAVIS: It was spicy, wasn't it?

00:50:17.817 --> 00:50:21.697
ASHLEY: It was spicy, but I don't think it's going to go bad

00:50:21.697 --> 00:50:24.427
the further down it goes, you know?

00:50:24.427 --> 00:50:27.267
I think it's okay. I think the food's going to be very good.

00:50:27.267 --> 00:50:29.527
TALIESIN: I worry that the food
might be part of the problem.

00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:31.287
TRAVIS: (upset stomach noises)

00:50:31.287 --> 00:50:34.727
TALIESIN: I don't have the tools right now to really know.

00:50:34.727 --> 00:50:36.581
MARISHA: There was a lot of nodding and smiling,

00:50:36.581 --> 00:50:38.217
in all the villagers, you notice that?

00:50:38.217 --> 00:50:41.235
Like everyone, you were like, "Hey, are you happy?

00:50:41.235 --> 00:50:42.567
"Do you like it here?" and they were just like--

00:50:42.567 --> 00:50:45.327
LIAM: No, they are not right in the head.
SAM: They're nice people!

00:50:45.327 --> 00:50:46.197
MARISHA: And then they were like,

00:50:46.197 --> 00:50:47.999
"We don't want to move into your house.

00:50:47.999 --> 00:50:49.587
We can totally camp outside."

00:50:49.587 --> 00:50:50.917
And they were like (vocalizing)

00:50:50.917 --> 00:50:54.427
SAM: They're nice. That's what nice people look like, Beau!

00:50:54.427 --> 00:50:56.677
MARISHA: Name one nice person. We just talked about how

00:50:56.677 --> 00:50:58.467
we only know people-- that's not real!

00:50:58.467 --> 00:50:59.967
SAM: We've killed all the nice people.

00:50:59.967 --> 00:51:03.085
LIAM: It's unsettling. They don't
know why they've come here,

00:51:03.085 --> 00:51:04.857
they don't remember where they came from,

00:51:04.857 --> 00:51:07.632
they have nothing on them except for rags.

00:51:07.632 --> 00:51:10.587
TALIESIN: Yeah, I love nice, but you got to have boundaries.

00:51:10.587 --> 00:51:11.620
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:17.185
TRAVIS: Okay, so what are we doing before dinner?

00:51:17.185 --> 00:51:19.702
Flying back and coming back?

00:51:20.687 --> 00:51:23.077
Or only a few going, and the rest of us stay?

00:51:23.077 --> 00:51:24.337
LAURA: Going what, to the boat?

00:51:24.337 --> 00:51:25.170
TRAVIS: I thought you said you were going

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:26.128
to get supplies or some shit!

00:51:26.128 --> 00:51:27.664
SAM: I think she was talking about flying us across

00:51:27.664 --> 00:51:30.413
the island to go to the Ruins.
LAURA: Yes, that's what I said.

00:51:30.413 --> 00:51:32.553
TRAVIS: Oh great, so we're just hanging out until dinner, then?
ASHLEY: I'm very curious about these Ruins.

00:51:32.553 --> 00:51:33.547
SAM: I think so.
LAURA: I think so.

00:51:33.547 --> 00:51:36.707
LIAM: Well, I don't-- are we just
going to scope it out further?

00:51:36.707 --> 00:51:38.685
We're not going to go exploring?

00:51:38.685 --> 00:51:39.997
TRAVIS: I guess we could walk around the village, yeah.

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:41.727
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that.

00:51:41.727 --> 00:51:43.517
LAURA: Yeah, let's walk around.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:45.258
TRAVIS: We grab our hotel room keys,

00:51:45.258 --> 00:51:47.191
and we head out to explore the resort.

00:51:47.191 --> 00:51:48.362
(laughter)

00:51:48.362 --> 00:51:49.528
MATT: All right.

00:51:52.224 --> 00:51:53.399
We'll say for the purposes of--

00:51:53.399 --> 00:51:54.623
MARISHA: Four Seasons Tree Trunk!
MATT: -- the circumstance, you guys

00:51:54.623 --> 00:51:56.037
have spent a little bit time in the house,

00:51:56.037 --> 00:51:57.367
just getting your bearings,

00:51:57.367 --> 00:51:59.045
like a short rest, while you're in there.

00:51:59.045 --> 00:52:00.607
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I need a short rest.

00:52:01.617 --> 00:52:03.678
MATT: If you needed it.

00:52:03.678 --> 00:52:07.687
You do sense, and still in this house,

00:52:08.927 --> 00:52:11.247
it hasn't really left you,

00:52:11.247 --> 00:52:13.567
and you guys haven't talked about it openly,

00:52:13.567 --> 00:52:17.137
but you all still feel that creeping sense

00:52:18.017 --> 00:52:19.875
that you're being watched.

00:52:21.467 --> 00:52:23.607
TALIESIN: You know--
TRAVIS: You keep fucking saying that, DM!

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.897
MARISHA: Is that something we should talk about? (laughter)

00:52:25.897 --> 00:52:27.822
MATT: You don't have to if you don't want to, but

00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:30.238
I will say--
SAM: Fjord,

00:52:30.238 --> 00:52:32.437
do you want to do your See Invisibility thing, maybe?

00:52:32.437 --> 00:52:34.377
LAURA: That would be so smart! Ooh, ooh!

00:52:34.377 --> 00:52:36.797
TRAVIS: My what?
LAURA: Is that okay to drink?

00:52:36.797 --> 00:52:38.757
TRAVIS: It's been here for, you know, a couple weeks.

00:52:39.748 --> 00:52:40.607
(laughter)

00:52:40.607 --> 00:52:42.047
I can see invisibility?

00:52:42.047 --> 00:52:44.897
SAM: Yes, you can see invisibility!

00:52:44.897 --> 00:52:47.137
TRAVIS: Sure! (explosion) I'll summon the sword.

00:52:47.137 --> 00:52:48.102
MATT: All right.

00:52:48.102 --> 00:52:48.935
(laughter)

00:52:48.935 --> 00:52:50.737
TRAVIS: And I will (explosion)

00:52:50.737 --> 00:52:54.197
cast See Invisibility.
(laughter)

00:52:54.197 --> 00:52:55.652
ASHLEY: Cool!

00:52:55.652 --> 00:52:58.217
MATT: You do, and as your vision shimmers,

00:52:58.217 --> 00:53:02.397
that faint veil of silver gossamer

00:53:02.397 --> 00:53:05.087
that permeates the vicinity,

00:53:05.087 --> 00:53:08.827
that would itself adhere to and bring prominently forth,

00:53:08.827 --> 00:53:11.209
anything that is invisible,

00:53:11.209 --> 00:53:14.733
reveals nothing out of the ordinary.

00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:17.167
TRAVIS: They're ... everywhere!

00:53:17.167 --> 00:53:18.737
LAURA: What?
MARISHA: What, what is?

00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:21.297
TRAVIS: Beasts of incalculable size--

00:53:21.297 --> 00:53:23.035
no, I can't fucking-- there's nothing, we're fine.

00:53:23.035 --> 00:53:24.537
(laughter)

00:53:24.537 --> 00:53:25.497
SAM: When we walk around the village,

00:53:25.497 --> 00:53:27.947
should I go invisible, just in case you want me

00:53:27.947 --> 00:53:29.777
to, like, go scope something out

00:53:29.777 --> 00:53:31.847
that's behind the curtain or something?

00:53:31.847 --> 00:53:33.407
MARISHA: Yeah! That sounds great!
SAM: Yeah?

00:53:33.407 --> 00:53:34.357
LAURA: We'll just say you're sleeping.

00:53:34.357 --> 00:53:35.937
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:35.937 --> 00:53:37.227
MARISHA: Yeah, you got indigestion.

00:53:37.227 --> 00:53:39.627
SAM: Yeah, I ate some of the flower things.

00:53:39.627 --> 00:53:40.837
ASHLEY: You ate some of the flowers.

00:53:40.837 --> 00:53:44.137
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going
to burn a Divine Intervention.

00:53:44.137 --> 00:53:45.811
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:53:45.811 --> 00:53:47.465
TALIESIN: What's watching us?

00:53:48.897 --> 00:53:49.818
Nope.

00:53:49.818 --> 00:53:52.367
(laughter)

00:53:52.367 --> 00:53:54.917
It-- never going to happen, but it's always worth trying.

00:53:54.917 --> 00:53:55.750
MATT: Sure.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.867
If you got a Commune spell later, you could always try that.

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:58.757
TALIESIN: Not 'til tomorrow.

00:53:58.757 --> 00:54:01.859
TRAVIS: Do we see Doron as we're leaving?

00:54:01.859 --> 00:54:04.637
The dwarf whose family normally resides here?

00:54:04.637 --> 00:54:07.169
MATT: No, the family is no longer
waiting outside of the abode.

00:54:07.169 --> 00:54:08.517
You guys have been left on your own,

00:54:08.517 --> 00:54:10.556
and there's nobody waiting for you when you exit.

00:54:10.556 --> 00:54:14.777
Everyone's returned to their general routine.

00:54:14.777 --> 00:54:17.597
MARISHA: Are there dwarves-- sorry.
MATT: I do, however,

00:54:17.597 --> 00:54:21.105
if I could get everyone, if you don't mind

00:54:21.105 --> 00:54:23.866
to just make an investigation check for me?

00:54:25.491 --> 00:54:26.836
TALIESIN: I hate investigation checks.

00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:28.487
MARISHA: I love it!

00:54:30.259 --> 00:54:33.817
TRAVIS: Woo, yeah!
MARISHA: What? Ooh hoo hoo.

00:54:33.817 --> 00:54:35.277
TRAVIS: 25.
ASHLEY: Damn!

00:54:35.277 --> 00:54:37.417
LAURA: 18.
LIAM: 21.

00:54:37.417 --> 00:54:39.250
SAM: Natural 20 plus 11.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:41.217
(exclaiming)

00:54:41.217 --> 00:54:42.977
ASHLEY: 17.
MATT: All right.

00:54:42.977 --> 00:54:44.017
TALIESIN: 15.
MATT: Okay.

00:54:44.017 --> 00:54:45.717
MARISHA: 23.
LAURA: Wow!

00:54:45.717 --> 00:54:47.214
MATT: Not too bad.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:54:47.214 --> 00:54:48.530
MATT: All right, cool.

00:54:49.367 --> 00:54:50.200
So you continue on.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.047
MARISHA: Well wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:54:52.047 --> 00:54:53.105
SAM: We didn't get to see.

00:54:53.105 --> 00:54:55.717
MARISHA: Are the drawers-- are there cabinets in this house?

00:54:55.717 --> 00:54:56.995
Is there a safe?

00:54:56.995 --> 00:54:59.239
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: What did they leave behind?

00:54:59.239 --> 00:55:01.127
MATT: It's basic furniture. There's no cabinets.

00:55:01.127 --> 00:55:04.727
There isn't a massive need for cabinetry here.

00:55:04.727 --> 00:55:07.279
MARISHA: Well, bedside-- hotels. Is there, you know--?

00:55:07.279 --> 00:55:08.862
MATT: (laughs) There is no Gideon's Bible.

00:55:08.862 --> 00:55:10.925
TRAVIS: Gideon Bible, yeah!
(laughter)

00:55:10.925 --> 00:55:14.092
MATT: But like I said, there's a

00:55:14.092 --> 00:55:16.458
handful of really simple

00:55:16.458 --> 00:55:19.987
bed platforms, and there is a table, and some stools,

00:55:19.987 --> 00:55:21.487
and that's primarily it.

00:55:21.487 --> 00:55:22.867
MARISHA: No other belongings?
ASHLEY: No decorations?

00:55:22.867 --> 00:55:24.207
MARISHA: Yeah, decorations?

00:55:24.207 --> 00:55:27.357
MATT: No decorations.
SAM: Do it with two hands!

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.082
MARISHA: No other

00:55:30.082 --> 00:55:32.740
sign that it feels like someone's home?

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:37.007
Does it just look like a crash pad?

00:55:37.007 --> 00:55:39.337
MATT: Kind of. Things may have been taken out.

00:55:39.337 --> 00:55:42.237
TALIESIN: Is there a sense maybe, just in the discoloration

00:55:42.237 --> 00:55:43.627
of the walls or otherwise that

00:55:43.627 --> 00:55:46.584
there was once furniture or things in here?

00:55:46.584 --> 00:55:48.407
You know how sometimes you just get a little impression

00:55:48.407 --> 00:55:50.747
from things of being against a wall for too long,

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:51.963
and then you...
MATT: Um...

00:55:53.007 --> 00:55:55.437
TALIESIN: Just if there's anything that hints

00:55:55.437 --> 00:55:57.804
that this was once a more lavish home?

00:55:59.177 --> 00:56:00.560
MATT: Go ahead...

00:56:02.035 --> 00:56:03.164
Go ahead and make an investigation check.

00:56:03.164 --> 00:56:03.997
TALIESIN: All right.

00:56:03.997 --> 00:56:05.067
MARISHA: Come on, Cad!

00:56:05.067 --> 00:56:07.645
TALIESIN: I'm going to boost this
one because this is something--

00:56:07.645 --> 00:56:09.347
TRAVIS: How do you boost it?

00:56:09.347 --> 00:56:11.367
TALIESIN: I'm using Guidance.
LAURA: Guidance!

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:13.959
TRAVIS: Didn't know if you were, like, (choir vocalizing).

00:56:13.959 --> 00:56:14.826
ASHLEY: (choir vocalizing)

00:56:14.826 --> 00:56:16.396
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:56:16.396 --> 00:56:18.029
All right, that's

00:56:18.879 --> 00:56:20.337
22!

00:56:20.337 --> 00:56:21.170
MATT: Nice!

00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:24.191
TALIESIN: No. (laughter)

00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:25.441
MATT: Best that you can tell,

00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:28.557
the only things that have been taken

00:56:28.557 --> 00:56:32.297
have been simple weapons or tools.

00:56:32.297 --> 00:56:36.737
Things that might-- you can see a little bit

00:56:36.737 --> 00:56:38.757
of dust residue around the shapes of some things

00:56:38.757 --> 00:56:41.357
that were taken, but no art pieces,

00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:43.187
no pieces of furniture were removed.

00:56:43.187 --> 00:56:48.127
MARISHA: No like, you know, pencil
marks carved into door frames

00:56:48.127 --> 00:56:51.575
to signify their kids growing. Nothing like that?

00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:54.957
MATT: Not in this particular abode, no.

00:56:54.957 --> 00:56:56.087
MARISHA: Don't trust it.

00:56:56.087 --> 00:56:57.978
TALIESIN: No-- yeah.

00:56:57.978 --> 00:56:59.467
TRAVIS: We're all in that video game

00:56:59.467 --> 00:57:00.933
where they can't leave the first level.

00:57:00.933 --> 00:57:02.577
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughter)

00:57:02.577 --> 00:57:04.290
TALIESIN: No plaster patches from nails in the wall

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.804
for, like, a Pink Floyd poster?

00:57:05.804 --> 00:57:06.965
MATT: Right. No, nothing like that.

00:57:06.965 --> 00:57:09.657
ASHLEY: It's a tree? We're at the base of the tree?

00:57:09.657 --> 00:57:12.995
MATT: Yeah, you guys are inside the hollowed out tree,

00:57:13.847 --> 00:57:15.767
getting ready to exit, from what you were saying, so.

00:57:15.767 --> 00:57:18.536
ASHLEY: The ceiling is just of the top of the...?

00:57:18.536 --> 00:57:20.427
MATT: If you look up into the hollow,

00:57:20.427 --> 00:57:22.907
there-- it just goes straight up,

00:57:22.907 --> 00:57:24.937
and you can see where it breaks off the top,

00:57:24.937 --> 00:57:27.047
and there are a couple of small,

00:57:27.047 --> 00:57:29.857
looks like shelf platforms above.

00:57:29.857 --> 00:57:31.087
About 20 or so feet up.

00:57:32.202 --> 00:57:33.157
TALIESIN: I'd like to take a look at that.

00:57:33.157 --> 00:57:34.447
MARISHA: Oh hell yeah!

00:57:34.447 --> 00:57:35.797
LIAM: I send Frumpkin up.

00:57:35.797 --> 00:57:37.297
TALIESIN: Oh that'll do, too.
MATT: Okay.

00:57:38.557 --> 00:57:40.465
Frumpkin heads up.

00:57:40.465 --> 00:57:42.007
In the shelf units there, you can see

00:57:42.007 --> 00:57:45.028
there is a small wooden chest

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:48.555
that is tucked into one of the little platforms there,

00:57:48.555 --> 00:57:50.108
with a folded blanket.

00:57:50.108 --> 00:57:53.575
And on the other platform a little further up,

00:57:53.575 --> 00:57:57.537
you see some jeweler's tools.

00:57:57.537 --> 00:58:00.107
Like a small kit for jewel making.

00:58:00.107 --> 00:58:01.347
Jewelry making.

00:58:01.347 --> 00:58:02.857
TRAVIS: You totally found the hidden shit.

00:58:02.857 --> 00:58:05.839
MARISHA: It's a platformer, yeah! (laughter)

00:58:06.889 --> 00:58:07.722
ASHLEY: How did it get up--?

00:58:07.722 --> 00:58:09.377
LIAM: Beauregard, there's some things up above.

00:58:09.377 --> 00:58:12.417
Would you like to do your monk thing you do?

00:58:12.417 --> 00:58:13.557
MARISHA: Yep.

00:58:13.557 --> 00:58:15.187
Dope monk shit, coming up.

00:58:15.187 --> 00:58:17.839
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, wall climb.

00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:19.687
MATT: And what's your-- your movement is?

00:58:19.687 --> 00:58:20.547
MARISHA: 50.

00:58:20.547 --> 00:58:21.892
MATT: Yeah, that's enough to get there.

00:58:21.892 --> 00:58:23.890
(scoffs) Monks.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:25.867
So yeah, you run up one side,

00:58:25.867 --> 00:58:27.867
and leap off the other one, just ricocheting,

00:58:27.867 --> 00:58:29.819
parkouring, until eventually you grab

00:58:29.819 --> 00:58:31.407
(grunting) one of the platforms,

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:32.797
and pull yourself up.
LAURA: (clapping)

00:58:32.797 --> 00:58:35.787
There's just enough space, to, like, barely stand on it,

00:58:35.787 --> 00:58:38.169
with your arms on the wall.

00:58:38.169 --> 00:58:40.967
MARISHA: Can I do that cool, like, wedge myself thing?

00:58:40.967 --> 00:58:42.147
Is it close enough?

00:58:42.147 --> 00:58:43.447
MATT: The other wall's not close enough

00:58:43.447 --> 00:58:44.307
to wedge yourself between.
MARISHA: Oh.

00:58:44.307 --> 00:58:45.867
MATT: At this point, you're having to jump off,

00:58:45.867 --> 00:58:47.827
and then catch the edge to get up there,

00:58:47.827 --> 00:58:49.437
but the actual platform itself is thin,

00:58:49.437 --> 00:58:50.687
based on the chest that's there,

00:58:50.687 --> 00:58:52.437
so you're having to straddle a little bit,

00:58:52.437 --> 00:58:53.545
and push yourself against the wall.

00:58:53.545 --> 00:58:56.197
MARISHA: How big is the chest?
LIAM: Frumpkin lands on your head, Dagon-style.

00:58:56.197 --> 00:58:57.088
MATT: There you go.

00:58:57.088 --> 00:58:59.617
MARISHA: Get! Get!

00:58:59.617 --> 00:59:01.867
Is it-- can I push the chest off?
MATT: That is one hit point.

00:59:03.737 --> 00:59:06.217
MARISHA: Is it heavy enough that I can push the chest off?

00:59:07.437 --> 00:59:08.917
MATT: It's pretty light.

00:59:08.917 --> 00:59:10.907
MARISHA: Okay. Fjord, catch!

00:59:10.907 --> 00:59:12.117
TRAVIS: What?
MARISHA: (grunts)

00:59:12.117 --> 00:59:15.217
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! (laughter)

00:59:15.217 --> 00:59:17.024
How big is this fucking chest you just threw at me?

00:59:17.024 --> 00:59:18.612
MARISHA: He said it was light-ish!

00:59:18.612 --> 00:59:20.037
MATT: It's light. It's not full.

00:59:20.037 --> 00:59:21.417
TRAVIS: 50 fucking feet in the air!

00:59:21.417 --> 00:59:22.937
MATT: Yeah!
TRAVIS: Piece of shit!

00:59:22.937 --> 00:59:23.847
MARISHA: Incoming!

00:59:23.847 --> 00:59:25.217
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check for me.

00:59:25.217 --> 00:59:26.277
TRAVIS: I'm not catching that!

00:59:26.277 --> 00:59:27.628
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: I'm getting outta the way!

00:59:27.628 --> 00:59:30.378
MATT: Okay. Yeah, it shatters on the ground.

00:59:30.378 --> 00:59:32.927
ASHLEY: I, oh, okay. (laughter)

00:59:32.927 --> 00:59:34.627
MATT: You throw it, you say, "Fjord,"

00:59:34.627 --> 00:59:36.117
Fjord goes, "No no no no no!"

00:59:36.117 --> 00:59:37.636
and then just refuses to grab it!

00:59:37.636 --> 00:59:38.707
TRAVIS: Yep!

00:59:38.707 --> 00:59:40.451
LAURA: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Can I try to grab it?

00:59:40.451 --> 00:59:42.567
MATT: Roll a dexterity saving throw for me.

00:59:42.567 --> 00:59:43.400
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.233
TRAVIS: What are you, nuts?

00:59:44.233 --> 00:59:47.542
MATT: To see if you have just enough reflex timing.

00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:50.165
TRAVIS: Stick your head out of
a four-story window and be like, "Here!"

00:59:50.165 --> 00:59:51.797
ASHLEY: Okay, so.
TRAVIS: Catch this air conditioner!

00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:53.227
MARISHA: You want a TV?
(laughter)

00:59:53.227 --> 00:59:54.147
MATT: This isn't a trap,

00:59:54.147 --> 00:59:55.987
so you don't have advantage on. This isn't, like, a hazard.

00:59:55.987 --> 01:00:00.390
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, so that was an 18 plus...

01:00:01.775 --> 01:00:03.208
3. 21.

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.777
MATT: Okay, as you pull back your hands,

01:00:05.777 --> 01:00:08.067
diving between your legs,

01:00:08.067 --> 01:00:10.777
and catching it right before it hits the ground,

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:12.874
your knuckles crack into the ground.

01:00:12.874 --> 01:00:14.767
(exclaiming)
ASHLEY: That was heavy!

01:00:14.767 --> 01:00:16.497
MATT: But only just from the-

01:00:16.497 --> 01:00:17.517
ASHLEY: The weight of the fall.

01:00:17.517 --> 01:00:19.087
MATT: Yeah, the moment of it hitting your hands,

01:00:19.087 --> 01:00:20.967
but you do prevent it from shattering.

01:00:20.967 --> 01:00:25.017
MARISHA: Sorry, I think the gravity added to the weight.

01:00:25.017 --> 01:00:26.669
ASHLEY: It's fine, I just didn't want to ruin--

01:00:26.669 --> 01:00:29.117
TRAVIS: Would you get down here? What are you thinking?

01:00:29.117 --> 01:00:30.427
MARISHA: Wait, there's another. Hang on.

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:32.987
TRAVIS: No, no, don't throw anymore shit!

01:00:32.987 --> 01:00:33.820
MARISHA: Other platform.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.953
MATT: You move to the other platform, yeah,

01:00:34.953 --> 01:00:37.957
and there is a little,

01:00:37.957 --> 01:00:39.767
looks like a collection on a stool.

01:00:39.767 --> 01:00:41.152
Some of the stools down below,

01:00:41.152 --> 01:00:44.009
and it has a little leather, partially unrolled,

01:00:45.127 --> 01:00:46.157
tool kit in there,

01:00:46.157 --> 01:00:48.827
that has all sorts of small jeweler's tools.

01:00:48.827 --> 01:00:50.197
It's a jeweler's kit.

01:00:50.197 --> 01:00:51.617
MARISHA: Very similar to the one that I keep?

01:00:51.617 --> 01:00:52.527
MATT: Yeah.

01:00:52.527 --> 01:00:55.697
MARISHA: Any other jewels or anything else up here?

01:00:55.697 --> 01:00:56.530
MATT: Just that.

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:57.427
LAURA: Does it look like it's been used?

01:00:57.427 --> 01:01:00.030
TRAVIS: Is anybody watching us do this?

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.977
MATT: Make a perception check.
LIAM: Something is.

01:01:01.977 --> 01:01:05.217
TALIESIN: Well you still have, see invisible things as well.

01:01:05.217 --> 01:01:06.807
TRAVIS: That's true, 16.

01:01:06.807 --> 01:01:09.147
MATT: 16. You don't notice anyone paying attention to you

01:01:09.147 --> 01:01:10.037
in the vicinity.

01:01:10.037 --> 01:01:11.137
MARISHA: Yeah, are they coated in dust?

01:01:11.137 --> 01:01:13.537
Does it look like they've been used recently?
MATT: No, but they're fairly rusted.

01:01:13.537 --> 01:01:15.333
They look old.

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:17.187
But they've been used. You can see where--

01:01:17.187 --> 01:01:18.627
the areas where they would mostly be used,

01:01:18.627 --> 01:01:20.377
the rust has been rubbed off of it.

01:01:22.197 --> 01:01:23.102
The ocean air,

01:01:23.102 --> 01:01:24.377
as it often does,

01:01:24.377 --> 01:01:26.227
with iron and other metals like that,

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:30.135
has done some exterior damage to the areas

01:01:30.135 --> 01:01:32.317
that aren't put to most use,

01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:34.597
but it's a functional jeweler's kit.

01:01:34.597 --> 01:01:36.380
MARISHA: How did they get up here?

01:01:37.269 --> 01:01:40.067
When coming up the wall, did I notice any type

01:01:40.067 --> 01:01:42.847
of, like, handholds or grooves,

01:01:42.847 --> 01:01:43.887
something that they've could've used?

01:01:43.887 --> 01:01:45.277
MATT: There are. It's not smooth.

01:01:45.277 --> 01:01:47.907
Like it's a rough, hollowed out interior of the trees.

01:01:47.907 --> 01:01:49.887
There are-- and it's what you use to jump off,

01:01:49.887 --> 01:01:51.297
and get yourself up there, was just

01:01:51.297 --> 01:01:55.575
the somewhat uneven interior of the tree bark.

01:01:56.657 --> 01:01:58.667
MARISHA: Doron's got moves, I think.

01:01:58.667 --> 01:02:00.922
I think he's got to be ripped under there, man!

01:02:00.922 --> 01:02:03.617
TALIESIN: But what do you see?
LAURA: Well, maybe it's not his.

01:02:04.477 --> 01:02:05.310
MARISHA: That's true.

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:08.127
LAURA: I mean, I have a feeling, like, the families maybe

01:02:08.127 --> 01:02:09.057
they are not allowed to have

01:02:09.057 --> 01:02:11.027
any materialistic things, right?

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.755
They're not allowed to own anything.

01:02:12.755 --> 01:02:14.367
MARISHA: Yeah, who knows how long?

01:02:14.367 --> 01:02:16.712
LAURA: They don't have assigned houses, you know?

01:02:16.712 --> 01:02:19.887
SAM: They just go around to each house,

01:02:19.887 --> 01:02:23.847
as they, like, providing sexual favors for each other?

01:02:23.847 --> 01:02:25.667
LAURA: Maybe, maybe. Oh!

01:02:25.667 --> 01:02:28.327
Maybe that's the thing here?
SAM: Is that a thing?

01:02:28.327 --> 01:02:30.207
ASHLEY: That's a thing!

01:02:30.207 --> 01:02:33.667
TRAVIS: I bring you jewels, you
cut them up, and then we bone.

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:34.587
Is that how it goes?

01:02:34.587 --> 01:02:35.877
SAM: Yeah, I've heard of-

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:38.952
TALIESIN: They were surprisingly
excited by your dick statues.

01:02:40.787 --> 01:02:42.467
MARISHA: Is there anything else up here? (laughter)

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:43.742
MATT: Nope. (clears throat)

01:02:43.742 --> 01:02:45.587
MARISHA: Okay, now does it go up any higher?

01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:47.227
Can I touch the--?

01:02:47.227 --> 01:02:49.477
MATT: You're towards the top of where the tree itself

01:02:49.477 --> 01:02:52.197
is broken, and it opens up into the sky.

01:02:52.197 --> 01:02:55.347
TRAVIS: Get up there. See if it's still misty and shit!

01:02:55.347 --> 01:02:57.847
MARISHA: Can I shimmy my way up and put--

01:02:57.847 --> 01:02:59.807
MATT: I'd say you be able to, yeah, it's rough enough.

01:02:59.807 --> 01:03:02.307
And you're very well practiced at this sort of thing,

01:03:02.307 --> 01:03:05.074
so you eventually leap up, grab, part of it

01:03:05.074 --> 01:03:06.147
starts to crack and pull back,

01:03:06.147 --> 01:03:07.787
and so you quickly leap, and not put your full weight

01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:10.647
on that one side, and then eventually pull yourself up over,

01:03:10.647 --> 01:03:12.337
where you can look beyond the peak

01:03:12.337 --> 01:03:14.657
of the broken part of the tree itself.

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:15.947
As you look down, you can see the village

01:03:15.947 --> 01:03:18.208
from a higher height.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.687
There are still trees that are taller around you,

01:03:19.687 --> 01:03:20.937
so you can't see above the canopy.

01:03:20.937 --> 01:03:22.037
This is not the tallest tree,

01:03:22.037 --> 01:03:22.870
and it's partially broken down,

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.737
but you have a nice view of the village

01:03:24.737 --> 01:03:26.327
from a slightly higher perspective

01:03:26.327 --> 01:03:29.587
and it's kinda cool, as simple as it is.

01:03:29.587 --> 01:03:31.697
Like it's beautiful, people are working together.

01:03:33.097 --> 01:03:35.087
It's simple, but functional.

01:03:35.087 --> 01:03:36.897
You can see now that there is--

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:38.267
on the northern side of the village,

01:03:38.267 --> 01:03:40.797
there are bonfires being set up.

01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:41.967
There is one large, central one,

01:03:41.967 --> 01:03:45.227
and there are two smaller ones to each side of it.

01:03:45.227 --> 01:03:47.563
It looks like chairs and tables are being set up now,

01:03:47.563 --> 01:03:50.247
probably for the feast tonight.

01:03:50.247 --> 01:03:52.502
MARISHA: Just doing a quick scan of the people.

01:03:52.502 --> 01:03:53.568
MATT: Yes.

01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:56.957
MARISHA: Do I notice anyone who
looks shifty, or being weird?

01:03:56.957 --> 01:03:57.790
They all look shifty.

01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:58.677
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:03:58.677 --> 01:03:59.917
MARISHA: Okay.

01:03:59.917 --> 01:04:02.345
TRAVIS: I love that you are judging people by their looks.

01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:03.187
MARISHA: I am totally-- (laughter)

01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:04.397
TALIESIN: Shifty, happy people everywhere.

01:04:04.397 --> 01:04:06.230
MARISHA: -- totally profiling.

01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:08.059
MATT: Not holding hands, though.

01:04:08.059 --> 01:04:11.118
MARISHA: What was it, perception? 14.

01:04:11.118 --> 01:04:12.459
MATT: 14.

01:04:12.459 --> 01:04:13.828
I mean.

01:04:13.828 --> 01:04:15.097
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: There isn't anybody

01:04:15.097 --> 01:04:16.517
in the corner with a long trench coat

01:04:16.517 --> 01:04:19.218
going like, "Ooh, they'll never see me!"

01:04:19.218 --> 01:04:21.017
Everyone seems to be,

01:04:21.017 --> 01:04:23.507
you know, they're from all over the map,

01:04:23.507 --> 01:04:25.434
as far as backgrounds look.

01:04:25.434 --> 01:04:26.427
SAM: That's my next character.

01:04:26.427 --> 01:04:30.155
MATT: You have some people where their attire resembles

01:04:30.155 --> 01:04:32.577
aspects of a Marquesian background.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:36.927
There are some folks that have some Dwendalian attire.

01:04:36.927 --> 01:04:38.557
There's a handful of folk look like they might--

01:04:38.557 --> 01:04:40.047
MARISHA: I guess I mean more in their demeanor

01:04:40.047 --> 01:04:41.567
than their appearance.

01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:42.883
MATT: Right. Best that you can tell,

01:04:42.883 --> 01:04:45.367
most everyone is going about a daily routine.

01:04:45.367 --> 01:04:48.477
A lot of them are helping set up the meal for the evening.

01:04:48.477 --> 01:04:49.310
MARISHA: Okay.

01:04:50.259 --> 01:04:53.662
MATT: But nobody is hiding in the shadows, or having

01:04:54.997 --> 01:04:57.794
clandestine conversations

01:04:57.794 --> 01:05:00.477
in the unseen corners of the village.

01:05:00.477 --> 01:05:01.647
MARISHA: I'm going to scoop up the jeweler's kit

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:03.237
on the way back down and head on down.

01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:04.070
MATT: Okay.

01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:10.687
LIAM: Veth, do you want to safely take a look at this chest?

01:05:10.687 --> 01:05:12.187
SAM: Oh yes, of course!

01:05:12.187 --> 01:05:14.967
TALIESIN: Do we think it might be magical, or?

01:05:14.967 --> 01:05:16.317
SAM: I'll check it for traps!

01:05:16.317 --> 01:05:17.317
MATT: Go for it.

01:05:19.377 --> 01:05:20.337
SAM: 26!

01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:21.847
MATT: 26, it is not trapped.

01:05:21.847 --> 01:05:23.737
SAM: I will unlock it!

01:05:23.737 --> 01:05:26.747
MATT: You go to it, and the lock is rusted and broken,

01:05:26.747 --> 01:05:29.851
you can just (pop) and it pulls off the wood.

01:05:29.851 --> 01:05:31.393
The wood just splinters.

01:05:31.393 --> 01:05:32.559
LAURA: Was it dusty at all--
SAM: I've done it!

01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:34.372
LAURA: -- or did it look like it's been opened recently?

01:05:34.372 --> 01:05:35.796
TRAVIS: Vokodo doesn't allow locks.
MATT: It looks fairly dusty.

01:05:35.796 --> 01:05:36.629
LAURA: Okay.

01:05:37.537 --> 01:05:38.379
SAM: (creaking)

01:05:38.379 --> 01:05:40.244
MATT: Okay, you look inside--
TRAVIS: (explosion)

01:05:40.244 --> 01:05:42.100
MATT: -- and you... (laughter)

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.597
TALIESIN: (explosion)
LIAM: Blue ink!

01:05:44.727 --> 01:05:46.346
MATT: Shards of diamond glass into your eye.

01:05:46.346 --> 01:05:48.307
SAM: (screaming)

01:05:48.307 --> 01:05:50.967
MATT: You look inside and there are two sets

01:05:50.967 --> 01:05:55.687
of pristine outfits, like, really nice, silk outfits,

01:05:55.687 --> 01:05:57.337
folded and placed in there.

01:05:57.337 --> 01:06:02.337
There is a mostly clean, if a little damp in the underside,

01:06:03.357 --> 01:06:04.190
child's doll.

01:06:05.157 --> 01:06:06.507
SAM: There's nothing creepier than that!

01:06:06.507 --> 01:06:07.937
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:09.215
TRAVIS: Yes, there is.
LAURA: Are there any notes?

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:10.566
Are there are note in the inside lid or anything?

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:12.017
SAM: Are these grownup attire?

01:06:12.017 --> 01:06:12.850
MATT: No, there are no notes.

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:15.979
You do see, however, a silver pocket watch.

01:06:17.467 --> 01:06:19.517
SAM: So the pocket watch, two outfits.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.797
Like, are they ceremonial attire?

01:06:21.797 --> 01:06:25.958
MATT: No, they look to be more middle to upper class-

01:06:25.958 --> 01:06:26.887
TRAVIS: Nightgowns?

01:06:27.827 --> 01:06:29.007
MATT: No.
LAURA: Clothes.

01:06:29.007 --> 01:06:30.909
MATT: Just clothes.

01:06:30.909 --> 01:06:32.197
LAURA: Is the pocket watch engraved?

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:33.387
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: On the back side of it,

01:06:33.387 --> 01:06:36.355
there are initials carved into it, B.V.

01:06:36.355 --> 01:06:38.658
SAM: B.V.?

01:06:38.658 --> 01:06:41.177
LIAM: Come on, B.V.Ds.
TRAVIS: Big Van!

01:06:41.177 --> 01:06:43.818
LAURA: B.V.?
MATT: B.V.

01:06:45.096 --> 01:06:46.423
LAURA: B period, V period?

01:06:46.423 --> 01:06:47.997
MATT: Correct.

01:06:47.997 --> 01:06:49.436
LAURA: B period, V period.

01:06:49.436 --> 01:06:52.187
SAM: Does it work? Can I wind it up a bit?

01:06:52.187 --> 01:06:54.427
MATT: It is not currently working at the moment.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.477
If you want to take a moment to wind it, you can try.

01:06:56.477 --> 01:06:58.437
SAM: Yeah, I'll do that.

01:06:58.437 --> 01:07:02.167
MATT: You tinker with it for a bit,

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:03.299
because you are proficient--

01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:04.377
are you proficient in Tinker's Tools?

01:07:04.377 --> 01:07:05.954
SAM: I <i>have</i> Tinker's Tools.

01:07:05.954 --> 01:07:07.601
MATT: But you are not proficient with it,

01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:09.267
go ahead and make a Tinker's Tools check for me.
SAM: I don't even have Tinker's Tools,

01:07:09.267 --> 01:07:10.827
I have Thieves' Tools.

01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:11.907
MATT: Oh, you do not have Tinker's Tools?

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:12.947
SAM: No.

01:07:12.947 --> 01:07:16.008
MATT: Huh. Okay, good to know.

01:07:16.008 --> 01:07:18.000
Just make an intelligence check for me.

01:07:19.227 --> 01:07:20.144
SAM: Three!

01:07:22.858 --> 01:07:24.627
MATT: You start

01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:26.293
messing with it a bit.
SAM: Oh, I do have Tinker's Tools!

01:07:26.293 --> 01:07:27.637
I do have them!

01:07:27.637 --> 01:07:28.987
SAM: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Jesus!

01:07:28.987 --> 01:07:29.897
LIAM: No, I don't!

01:07:30.827 --> 01:07:32.127
MATT: Add your proficiency bonus.

01:07:32.127 --> 01:07:33.637
Are you proficient with Tinker's Tools,

01:07:33.637 --> 01:07:34.927
or you just have them?

01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:37.447
SAM: No, I am not proficient with them.

01:07:38.327 --> 01:07:39.267
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

01:07:39.267 --> 01:07:42.647
SAM: Yes, because in here it says-- it's not under Tools,

01:07:42.647 --> 01:07:45.557
but over here in Equipment, I do have them.

01:07:45.557 --> 01:07:47.957
MATT: Okay, because you have the Tinker's Tools,

01:07:47.957 --> 01:07:50.047
you do not break the watch,

01:07:50.047 --> 01:07:52.197
but you do not get it functioning, either.

01:07:52.197 --> 01:07:53.030
SAM: Got it.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:58.027
MATT: You fail to get it back to
a state of actually keeping time.

01:07:58.027 --> 01:08:00.810
TALIESIN: That might be a job for Jester?

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.177
LAURA: I know, I was thinking about that, right?

01:08:02.177 --> 01:08:04.797
TALIESIN: Yeah, that might be right up your alley.

01:08:04.797 --> 01:08:06.497
LAURA: Mending!

01:08:06.497 --> 01:08:07.330
SAM: Oh.

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:09.407
MATT: Okay, you cast Mending on it?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:08:09.407 --> 01:08:12.577
MATT: As you release your hand for a second,

01:08:12.577 --> 01:08:15.897
you see a faint, swirl of greenish blue energy,

01:08:15.897 --> 01:08:17.477
(whooshing) around it

01:08:17.477 --> 01:08:19.377
before dissipating and as it does,

01:08:19.377 --> 01:08:21.317
you hear (ticking)

01:08:21.317 --> 01:08:23.077
SAM: Ooh, you fixed it!

01:08:23.077 --> 01:08:24.507
MATT: The springs, the gears.

01:08:24.507 --> 01:08:26.647
It is now a functional pocket watch.

01:08:26.647 --> 01:08:29.297
TRAVIS: The initials are still carved into it, right?

01:08:29.297 --> 01:08:30.741
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah, it doesn't change that.

01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:33.377
SAM: And the doll, is it a human doll?

01:08:33.377 --> 01:08:36.207
Is it a Planet of the Apes sort of human doll?

01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:38.667
MATT: It is humanoid, but it is simple in its design,

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:40.247
and you can't tell if it was intended to be

01:08:40.247 --> 01:08:41.887
a human, an elf, a dwarf, whatever,

01:08:41.887 --> 01:08:44.237
but it appears to be human.

01:08:44.237 --> 01:08:46.217
Appears to be female, in the way that it has

01:08:46.217 --> 01:08:50.470
stringy, yarn-like hair.

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:52.257
It's a little mildewed on one leg.

01:08:52.257 --> 01:08:53.090
SAM: Ew!

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:55.037
TRAVIS: You're not planning on keeping that, are you?

01:08:55.037 --> 01:08:57.517
LAURA: Keeping what?
TRAVIS: The pocket watch.

01:08:57.517 --> 01:08:58.857
LAURA: No, I think we should find out

01:08:58.857 --> 01:09:01.397
whoever has the initials B.V. here.

01:09:01.397 --> 01:09:02.747
TRAVIS: Right, but we put it back, right?

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:05.013
We're not going to steal on our first day?

01:09:05.013 --> 01:09:07.338
LAURA: I have a feeling whoever this belonged to

01:09:07.338 --> 01:09:09.867
doesn't remember that they ever had it!

01:09:09.867 --> 01:09:10.960
TRAVIS: What if they do?

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.937
LAURA: They don't, Fjord, nobody remembers anything!

01:09:13.937 --> 01:09:15.147
SAM: She's right, she's right.

01:09:15.147 --> 01:09:16.857
LAURA: I bet they knew they had to give

01:09:16.857 --> 01:09:18.147
all of their precious items away,

01:09:18.147 --> 01:09:21.647
and somebody here put this stuff in a box

01:09:21.647 --> 01:09:24.077
and said, "I don't want to give this away."

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.167
TRAVIS: Right, but what if they do remember?

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:27.287
What if it's important to them?

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:29.497
What if they do remember and they don't want to speak up

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.277
for fear of, I don't know, retribution,

01:09:31.277 --> 01:09:33.127
or being outed, or something, we shouldn't take it!

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.877
TALIESIN: What if someone hears the ticking sound

01:09:34.877 --> 01:09:35.927
that follows us everywhere?

01:09:35.927 --> 01:09:38.158
TRAVIS: We know the initials, we can put it back.

01:09:38.158 --> 01:09:39.607
It'll be a nice treat to open the box,

01:09:39.607 --> 01:09:40.957
and they find it's working.

01:09:42.047 --> 01:09:45.107
LAURA: It was pretty dusty, but sure.

01:09:45.107 --> 01:09:46.987
I'll put it back.

01:09:46.987 --> 01:09:49.087
TALIESIN: The trunk.
LAURA: Fjord's feeling honorable.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.295
SAM: Okay.

01:09:52.295 --> 01:09:55.878
TALIESIN: What kind of wood is made out of?

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:59.922
SAM: The box?
TALIESIN: The box, is the box local--

01:09:59.922 --> 01:10:02.877
SAM: (swishing)
TALIESIN: -- or was it from somewhere else?

01:10:02.877 --> 01:10:03.757
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:10:03.757 --> 01:10:06.287
TALIESIN: All right.
(laughter)

01:10:06.287 --> 01:10:07.325
SAM: I'm going to steal the pocket watch.

01:10:07.325 --> 01:10:10.833
TRAVIS: At least I still have this from my dead parents!

01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:12.817
MATT: Roll sleight of hand for me.

01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:14.552
TALIESIN: 14.

01:10:15.517 --> 01:10:16.350
SAM: 26.

01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:18.342
MATT: Yeah, no one notices.

01:10:19.797 --> 01:10:22.447
It feels like a darker cherry wood,

01:10:22.447 --> 01:10:23.987
which is not local to this place.

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:25.677
TALIESIN: All right, so this came here,

01:10:25.677 --> 01:10:29.697
this wasn't built here, this came here.

01:10:29.697 --> 01:10:32.647
MARISHA: And do we have any idea what the fancy clothes

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:34.597
look like they came from?

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.237
MATT: You want to pull them out and inspect?

01:10:36.237 --> 01:10:37.070
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:10:38.599 --> 01:10:39.432
TRAVIS: (explosion)

01:10:39.432 --> 01:10:41.227
MATT: They're not Dwendalian in nature.

01:10:41.227 --> 01:10:42.127
SAM: (gasps)

01:10:42.127 --> 01:10:45.327
MATT: They are elements that--
SAM: (gasps)

01:10:45.327 --> 01:10:46.597
MATT: What?
LAURA: You figure it out?

01:10:46.597 --> 01:10:47.897
SAM: Maybe!

01:10:47.897 --> 01:10:48.730
MARISHA: What?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.283
TALIESIN: Keep--

01:10:52.324 --> 01:10:53.757
MATT: But-- I don't know what you're doing

01:10:53.757 --> 01:10:56.325
with your face right now. But.

01:10:57.191 --> 01:10:58.067
SAM: I'll text you!

01:10:58.067 --> 01:11:00.750
MATT: They seem to be--

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.091
best you can tell, somewhat,

01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:13.212
I'm trying to say, like-- specifically. My brain's a little

01:11:13.212 --> 01:11:15.037
wander-y at the moment,

01:11:16.737 --> 01:11:18.227
Concordesque.

01:11:18.227 --> 01:11:21.287
Definitely coastal, Swavain Island-style,

01:11:21.287 --> 01:11:22.257
but it is upper class,

01:11:22.257 --> 01:11:24.517
which leads it to be one of the coastal cities

01:11:24.517 --> 01:11:25.987
of the Clovis Concord.

01:11:25.987 --> 01:11:28.900
You aren't able to really--

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.287
Make a history check for me.

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:31.207
MARISHA: Okay.

01:11:34.297 --> 01:11:35.130
Okay.

01:11:38.387 --> 01:11:40.729
18 plus 12,

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:44.271
is 30.

01:11:44.271 --> 01:11:46.267
MATT: (laughs) Shit!

01:11:46.267 --> 01:11:48.625
MARISHA: I rolled an 18.
MATT: Okay!

01:11:52.536 --> 01:11:53.637
MATT: It's not so much the style,

01:11:53.637 --> 01:11:57.827
more than you notice that there is a stitched

01:11:57.827 --> 01:11:59.691
engraving on the inside of one of the shirts.

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:02.927
This outfit was hand crafted

01:12:02.927 --> 01:12:06.867
by an extremely well-known crafter of finer silk clothing

01:12:07.727 --> 01:12:11.437
in Port Zoon, along the Menagerie Coast.

01:12:11.437 --> 01:12:13.487
MARISHA: Where we just were, like, not too long ago?

01:12:13.487 --> 01:12:14.757
MATT: You haven't been to Port Zoon yet.

01:12:14.757 --> 01:12:17.057
MARISHA: Oh, we haven't. It's north of Port Damali, right?

01:12:17.057 --> 01:12:17.907
Port Zoon?

01:12:17.907 --> 01:12:21.167
MATT: Port Zoon's northwest of Nicodranas.

01:12:21.167 --> 01:12:22.000
MATT: Right.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.027
TRAVIS: So yes, it would be in that northwest area.

01:12:23.027 --> 01:12:23.860
MARISHA: Like, north of, yeah, it's north.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.017
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you went up the coast.

01:12:25.017 --> 01:12:27.347
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:30.717
From-- it's made-- okay.

01:12:30.717 --> 01:12:32.217
So it's made, okay.

01:12:32.217 --> 01:12:35.007
MATT: So this clothing source would've been

01:12:35.007 --> 01:12:37.514
along the Menagerie Coast, probably Port Zoon.

01:12:37.514 --> 01:12:39.387
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:12:41.797 --> 01:12:42.797
LAURA: I just texted you!

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.152
This is me whispering!

01:12:47.119 --> 01:12:48.847
I'm just going to say it!

01:12:48.847 --> 01:12:49.680
MARISHA: Say it!

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.307
LAURA: What is Vandran's first name, Fjord?

01:12:51.307 --> 01:12:53.367
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.
TRAVIS: That is his first name!

01:12:53.367 --> 01:12:55.737
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah! (laughter)

01:12:55.737 --> 01:12:56.707
LAURA: What is his last name?

01:12:56.707 --> 01:12:59.078
TRAVIS: What do you think, I call him, like, Williams?

01:12:59.078 --> 01:13:01.595
(laughter)

01:13:01.595 --> 01:13:03.483
LAURA: I've heard of people calling this guy Foster,

01:13:03.483 --> 01:13:05.147
I don't know.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.317
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: That's a silly name.

01:13:06.317 --> 01:13:08.057
TRAVIS: I don't know if Vandran has a last name.

01:13:08.057 --> 01:13:09.604
SAM: Maybe it was Baby Vandran!

01:13:09.604 --> 01:13:10.987
It's his baby!

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:11.820
TRAVIS: Big Vandran!

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.680
SAM: Big Vandran!

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.047
MATT: You guys remember Big Vandran?

01:13:16.047 --> 01:13:18.427
ASHLEY: Wait, but you only know him by Vandran, then?

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:21.321
So you don't really know if it's his first or last name?

01:13:21.321 --> 01:13:23.217
MARISHA: Bartholomew Vandran!
TRAVIS: I guess that's true.

01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:24.767
Yeah, no, I only ever--

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.657
MARISHA: Barry Vandran!

01:13:27.777 --> 01:13:29.367
TRAVIS: Keep going.

01:13:29.367 --> 01:13:31.503
MARISHA: Bob, Bob Vandran.

01:13:31.503 --> 01:13:33.095
LAURA: Bobby, Bobby Vandran!
LIAM: Bob Villa.

01:13:33.095 --> 01:13:34.797
TRAVIS: Ol' B.V.!

01:13:34.797 --> 01:13:35.630
TALIESIN: Bo Vandran.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:36.977
TRAVIS: Vandran is the only name I ever heard.

01:13:36.977 --> 01:13:37.877
ASHLEY: I'll just let--
MARISHA: Hmm.

01:13:39.467 --> 01:13:41.317
MATT: So what else would you guys like to do?

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:45.167
TALIESIN: I think we should put all of this back, for now.

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:46.277
SAM: Are we going walking?

01:13:46.277 --> 01:13:48.577
LAURA: Didn't we, like, see him on an island?

01:13:48.577 --> 01:13:49.607
And he was happy?

01:13:49.607 --> 01:13:51.167
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:54.287
LAURA: But what if he was happy
just because he was forgetting?

01:13:54.287 --> 01:13:55.437
What if he's here?

01:13:55.437 --> 01:13:58.087
TRAVIS: (shushing)

01:13:58.087 --> 01:13:58.920
ASHLEY: Wait?

01:13:59.917 --> 01:14:01.675
SAM: Why are you shushing?

01:14:01.675 --> 01:14:03.175
TRAVIS: Huh?
SAM: Why are you shushing?

01:14:03.175 --> 01:14:04.387
TRAVIS: Because the DM's trying to talk.

01:14:04.387 --> 01:14:06.307
SAM: Oh, oh he is?
MARISHA: Is the DM trying to talk?

01:14:06.307 --> 01:14:07.696
MATT: No, DM's asking what you guys want to do.

01:14:07.696 --> 01:14:09.085
(laughter)

01:14:09.085 --> 01:14:10.717
LIAM: He's waiting for us to stop dicking around.

01:14:10.717 --> 01:14:11.667
We should make a choice.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:14.676
MARISHA: Well we're all-- the lede here.

01:14:14.676 --> 01:14:15.767
LAURA: Let's go for a walk!

01:14:15.767 --> 01:14:16.837
TRAVIS: That's a long way away.

01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:20.377
TALIESIN: But let's put the candle back,

01:14:20.377 --> 01:14:25.147
you know, let's just put the trunk.
TRAVIS: Put the candle back!

01:14:25.147 --> 01:14:26.338
MATT: It takes a little bit, but you manage to

01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:29.047
replace the things that-- or at least the chest.

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:30.007
TALIESIN: The chest, at the very least.

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:31.977
MATT: The chest as been replaced.

01:14:31.977 --> 01:14:32.810
TALIESIN: We know where it is.

01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:34.537
MARISHA: And these fancy clothes are for,

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:37.068
one for a female, and for a male?

01:14:37.068 --> 01:14:38.467
LAURA: Or are they both for a dude?

01:14:38.467 --> 01:14:39.837
MARISHA: Were they both for men?

01:14:39.837 --> 01:14:40.807
MATT: The styling?

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:43.707
One appears of them appears to be very male in cut,

01:14:43.707 --> 01:14:45.997
the other one is ambiguous, you're uncertain.

01:14:47.732 --> 01:14:48.717
TALIESIN: All right.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:51.937
MARISHA: Okay, maybe Vandran got married?

01:14:51.937 --> 01:14:54.744
Had a wife, maybe it's Bonnie Vandran?

01:14:54.744 --> 01:14:56.957
SAM: That's right!

01:14:56.957 --> 01:14:58.627
MARISHA: Bella Vandran!

01:14:58.627 --> 01:14:59.587
SAM: I like Bonnie.
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:14:59.587 --> 01:15:02.987
TALIESIN: Let's walk around and see if we can meet somebody,

01:15:02.987 --> 01:15:04.677
meet a B.V. somewhere in the--

01:15:04.677 --> 01:15:06.669
LAURA: Yeah, we'll have a look for B.V.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.969
SAM: I'm not a big fan of B.V., but you know.

01:15:08.969 --> 01:15:09.817
(laughter)

01:15:09.817 --> 01:15:12.027
MATT: All right, so.
SAM: It's sort of a stinky watch.

01:15:12.027 --> 01:15:14.027
MATT: So in the hours before dinner is to happen,

01:15:14.027 --> 01:15:16.817
what are you guys looking to accomplish in the village?

01:15:16.817 --> 01:15:18.017
TRAVIS: Should we just wander about,

01:15:18.017 --> 01:15:18.850
and take in what we can,

01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:21.992
locate landmarks?
LAURA: We'll ask everybody their name.

01:15:21.992 --> 01:15:23.300
TALIESIN: See if there's any community buildings,

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.177
get a lay of the land and then

01:15:25.177 --> 01:15:27.347
head in at some point to help cook?

01:15:27.347 --> 01:15:28.637
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:15:28.637 --> 01:15:33.494
LAURA: And I also want to talk to the Traveler

01:15:33.494 --> 01:15:35.553
while I'm walking. I know he's probably busy,

01:15:35.553 --> 01:15:38.417
and he's not going to come and say hi or anything,

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:41.467
but just so you know, this place is really creepy!

01:15:41.467 --> 01:15:43.167
I mean, it's not super creepy.

01:15:43.167 --> 01:15:44.617
There's, like, some weird stuff going on,

01:15:44.617 --> 01:15:47.867
and there's already another god here, so.

01:15:47.867 --> 01:15:50.327
But we're check out some places, like falls,

01:15:50.327 --> 01:15:52.503
Heaven Falls, anyway.

01:15:52.503 --> 01:15:54.727
You should come talk to me because

01:15:54.727 --> 01:15:55.927
I just want to get your input.

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:58.361
So come over whenever you get a chance.

01:15:58.361 --> 01:16:00.747
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: That's all.

01:16:00.747 --> 01:16:03.647
MATT: As you are walking, one of the villagers

01:16:03.647 --> 01:16:06.132
sidles up next to you, Jester.

01:16:06.132 --> 01:16:07.737
LAURA: Mm!

01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:09.163
MATT: Walking alongside you,

01:16:09.163 --> 01:16:10.837
with this

01:16:12.847 --> 01:16:16.417
intense, crimped red hair, and green eyes.

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:19.067
And follows in step next you and goes,

01:16:19.067 --> 01:16:22.687
"Another god, you say, that's,

01:16:22.687 --> 01:16:24.644
"that's all kinds of

01:16:25.557 --> 01:16:26.936
"fun."

01:16:26.936 --> 01:16:28.527
LAURA: Yeah!

01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:30.857
And it's like, I can't tell if it's actually a real god,

01:16:30.857 --> 01:16:34.167
or, like-- is this really the Traveler?

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.007
MATT: "No, it's not.

01:16:37.007 --> 01:16:39.147
"You're being duped by one of the denizens

01:16:39.147 --> 01:16:40.597
"of this weird village."
LAURA: I don't know,

01:16:40.597 --> 01:16:42.227
I don't know what this god here's like!

01:16:42.227 --> 01:16:43.967
It feels like somebody's watching us all the time!

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:46.410
TRAVIS: Do we see anyone next to Jester?
LAURA: I feel like he's around us, in the mist!

01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:47.959
MATT: Huh?
TRAVIS: Do we see anyone next to Jester?

01:16:47.959 --> 01:16:50.199
MATT: No, you see Jester talking to herself right now.

01:16:50.199 --> 01:16:51.567
LAURA: Which is not that unusual.

01:16:51.567 --> 01:16:54.197
TALIESIN: Let it happen, let it happen.

01:16:54.197 --> 01:16:56.117
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, in the mountain!

01:16:56.117 --> 01:16:57.647
There's, like, they say he's a god,

01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:59.177
and I think they sacrifice to him.

01:16:59.177 --> 01:17:01.477
Anyway, everybody that comes here forgets why they're here.

01:17:01.477 --> 01:17:04.805
MATT: "Oh, well we absolutely have to meet them!"

01:17:04.805 --> 01:17:06.512
LAURA: I know!

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:10.992
MATT: "Well, do you promise to introduce me?"

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:12.333
LAURA: Of course! We're going!

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.847
MATT: "Good, let me know when."

01:17:13.847 --> 01:17:14.680
LAURA: Okay.

01:17:15.627 --> 01:17:18.497
MATT: And he breaks off and you look back

01:17:18.497 --> 01:17:21.387
to the rest of the group and back, and he's gone.

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:24.351
LIAM: Rest of the group is just standing,
group-watching her.

01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:26.767
(laughter)

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:28.007
Good talk?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:17:28.007 --> 01:17:30.057
(laughter)

01:17:30.057 --> 01:17:34.747
MATT: Okay, you said you were asking around people's names?

01:17:34.747 --> 01:17:36.007
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:17:36.007 --> 01:17:36.977
SAM: I'm invisible for all of it.

01:17:36.977 --> 01:17:38.647
MATT: Okay, is there a specific,

01:17:38.647 --> 01:17:40.983
as opposed to us role-playing you asking

01:17:40.983 --> 01:17:43.187
50 people what their names are individually,

01:17:43.187 --> 01:17:45.189
is there a specific goal in mind for this?

01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:48.037
LIAM: Make with the NPCs, Matthew!
LAURA: I want to know somebody with the--

01:17:48.037 --> 01:17:49.257
MATT: Let me bring up babynames.com,

01:17:49.257 --> 01:17:50.527
and I'll just run through them all for you,

01:17:50.527 --> 01:17:51.527
I can find a voice for each,

01:17:51.527 --> 01:17:53.084
but I figure for the sake of brevity.

01:17:53.084 --> 01:17:54.687
TRAVIS: Could I look for someone that might embody

01:17:54.687 --> 01:17:57.847
a member of the hunting party,

01:17:57.847 --> 01:18:01.247
and ask them to describe what Terra looks like,

01:18:01.247 --> 01:18:03.527
to pretend that we're looking for them?

01:18:03.527 --> 01:18:05.557
MATT: Yeah, no worries.

01:18:05.557 --> 01:18:08.937
You do, actually, heading back to where the bonfires are,

01:18:08.937 --> 01:18:12.817
you can see both Pono and Jaina are in the process

01:18:12.817 --> 01:18:16.047
of taking the corpse of the displacer beast,

01:18:16.047 --> 01:18:17.527
and they are skinning it,

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:19.027
and they are preparing it,

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:22.237
on a large, metal rod.

01:18:22.237 --> 01:18:25.216
Not like a spit to put through it, but to hang it from,

01:18:25.216 --> 01:18:26.697
over the bonfire to be cooked,

01:18:26.697 --> 01:18:28.357
and there was a larger one to the left as well,

01:18:28.357 --> 01:18:29.547
that's being prepared.

01:18:29.547 --> 01:18:31.027
But as you guys approach, you can see,

01:18:31.027 --> 01:18:34.217
Pono's like, "Oh it's good see all of you.

01:18:34.217 --> 01:18:36.964
"I'm glad you're staying for dinner, at the very least.

01:18:36.964 --> 01:18:38.437
"I think this'll be a good meal.

01:18:38.437 --> 01:18:41.977
"I'm excited to see if we can safely say we outdid the

01:18:41.977 --> 01:18:44.747
"the five person team.

01:18:44.747 --> 01:18:46.597
"So what can we do for you?"

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:49.047
TRAVIS: I was actually wondering, we're looking forward

01:18:49.047 --> 01:18:51.869
to meeting the third of your tribunal.

01:18:51.869 --> 01:18:53.937
This Terra, what do they look like?

01:18:53.937 --> 01:18:58.687
MATT: "Oh, Terra, she's a mighty tall one,

01:18:58.687 --> 01:19:01.047
"not unlike your friend there, a bit."

01:19:01.047 --> 01:19:02.067
TALIESIN: What, do you need me?

01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:03.757
I was going to, okay.

01:19:03.757 --> 01:19:05.277
MARISHA: No, we're just using you
for reference, you're cool.

01:19:05.277 --> 01:19:07.067
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, that happens.

01:19:07.067 --> 01:19:09.777
MATT: "Towering, and intimidating lass,

01:19:09.777 --> 01:19:14.188
"but keen of eye, sarcastic wit,

01:19:14.188 --> 01:19:18.725
"and ripe ready to throw down if anyone looks at her wrong."

01:19:18.725 --> 01:19:20.627
TRAVIS: I gather. I wanted to thank you again

01:19:20.627 --> 01:19:23.477
for coming to our aid, out in the wilderness.

01:19:23.477 --> 01:19:27.627
If you need anything from us, you have us at your back.

01:19:27.627 --> 01:19:29.867
MATT: "Great," and he puts a large, sharpened blade

01:19:29.867 --> 01:19:33.507
in your hand and goes, help me cut the flank off this!

01:19:33.507 --> 01:19:34.360
TRAVIS: Okay!

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.387
SAM: (laughs)

01:19:36.387 --> 01:19:39.697
MATT: So Fjord's now helping them
butcher the displacer beast

01:19:39.697 --> 01:19:41.709
and prepare it for cooking.

01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:42.947
What are the rest of you doing?

01:19:42.947 --> 01:19:45.908
LIAM: I'm going to take a seat by one of the bonfires

01:19:45.908 --> 01:19:50.387
and pull out my spell book, and set it on the ground,

01:19:50.387 --> 01:19:52.817
and (whooshing) put one

01:19:52.817 --> 01:19:55.817
globule of light floating just about it for light,

01:19:55.817 --> 01:19:59.927
and I pull out the wand that was gifted to me by Calianna,

01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:03.335
and I just take it and jam it into the ground standing up.

01:20:03.335 --> 01:20:06.637
And I just start taking notes,

01:20:06.637 --> 01:20:10.233
and spending some time designing.

01:20:10.233 --> 01:20:11.287
MATT: You got it.

01:20:11.287 --> 01:20:12.597
All righty, anybody else?

01:20:12.597 --> 01:20:13.687
TALIESIN: I'm going to go into the kitchens

01:20:13.687 --> 01:20:15.887
and see if they need any help, so.

01:20:15.887 --> 01:20:18.457
MATT: Okay. The kitchen is not as much an enclosed space,

01:20:18.457 --> 01:20:20.787
but not too far from where the bonfires are,

01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:22.280
to the northwest area,

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.977
there are some stone slabs that are set up,

01:20:24.977 --> 01:20:28.407
where you can see they're taking various gathered herbs.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:31.825
There are clusters of thick,

01:20:31.825 --> 01:20:34.208
subterranean swamp root,

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:36.987
which seems like it shouldn't grow naturally

01:20:36.987 --> 01:20:38.577
on an island with this sort of a biome,

01:20:38.577 --> 01:20:40.307
but nevertheless, here they have it.

01:20:40.307 --> 01:20:42.197
And you can see them in the process of cutting it up.

01:20:42.197 --> 01:20:44.487
And yeah, people are preparing

01:20:44.487 --> 01:20:46.837
things to use in the cooking and the flavoring process

01:20:46.837 --> 01:20:48.387
of whatever the dinner's going to be.

01:20:48.387 --> 01:20:52.087
So as you arrive, you can see there's one figure,

01:20:52.087 --> 01:20:55.364
there's this very, squat,

01:20:56.467 --> 01:21:00.625
muscular-looking humanoid woman in her 50s or so.

01:21:01.717 --> 01:21:06.357
Hair's thinning a bit, has a really intense smile,

01:21:06.357 --> 01:21:08.567
these very bright teeth, that looks towards you

01:21:08.567 --> 01:21:13.214
and goes, "Oh, I'm Anola, and you are a tall one!

01:21:13.214 --> 01:21:15.587
"What's your plan, what're you doing?"

01:21:15.587 --> 01:21:17.137
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you, Caduceus Clay.

01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:19.827
I was trying to just be useful.

01:21:19.827 --> 01:21:22.599
I'm usually cooking for my friends, anyway,

01:21:22.599 --> 01:21:24.317
when we're on the road, and I figure--

01:21:24.317 --> 01:21:25.597
MATT: "You could be useful!

01:21:25.597 --> 01:21:27.397
"That you can, come here, come!"
TALIESIN: I'm happy to be here.

01:21:27.397 --> 01:21:28.230
All right!

01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.837
MATT: So she begins to give you the overview

01:21:30.837 --> 01:21:34.337
of their process of preparing these different spices

01:21:34.337 --> 01:21:37.307
and salts and additional vegetation

01:21:37.307 --> 01:21:38.757
to be brought along with the meat-based meal.

01:21:38.757 --> 01:21:41.037
TALIESIN: This is all new to me, I assume, this stuff?

01:21:41.037 --> 01:21:43.397
MATT: Some of it is, a lot of it adjacent

01:21:43.397 --> 01:21:45.557
to other experience and knowledge you have,

01:21:45.557 --> 01:21:47.007
it's just through the filter

01:21:47.007 --> 01:21:50.357
of what's scavengeable here on this island.

01:21:50.357 --> 01:21:51.677
TALIESIN: What was her name again, by the way?

01:21:51.677 --> 01:21:53.275
MATT: Anola, which you heard before.

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.603
Anola's the one that prepares the meals, primarily.

01:21:55.603 --> 01:21:58.327
So she's like the head

01:21:58.327 --> 01:22:01.337
chef if that's what you'd call it in the middle of this--

01:22:01.337 --> 01:22:02.170
this commune.

01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:04.477
TALIESIN: This is really, really interesting.

01:22:04.477 --> 01:22:07.787
What would you call this? These flavors--

01:22:07.787 --> 01:22:10.187
putting this together this way is really fascinating.

01:22:10.187 --> 01:22:11.387
MATT: "We call it delicious!"

01:22:11.387 --> 01:22:12.974
TALIESIN: Yeah, where did you learn to cook?

01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:15.007
SAM: (laughs)

01:22:15.007 --> 01:22:17.207
MATT: "You know, I just always kind of knew how."

01:22:17.207 --> 01:22:18.957
TALIESIN: That's fair, okay.

01:22:18.957 --> 01:22:20.207
MATT: "Just call it a knack."

01:22:20.207 --> 01:22:22.165
TALIESIN: Calling is a knack, all right.

01:22:23.667 --> 01:22:25.767
Oh boy.

01:22:25.767 --> 01:22:26.747
MATT: The rest of you?

01:22:26.747 --> 01:22:30.707
LAURA: I'm going to sit down,

01:22:30.707 --> 01:22:34.407
and offer my services out to any villagers

01:22:34.407 --> 01:22:37.887
that would like a portrait of themselves.

01:22:37.887 --> 01:22:40.417
Just drawings available.

01:22:40.417 --> 01:22:41.250
LIAM: Caricature artist?

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.997
LAURA: Caricature artist, while dinners are being prepared.

01:22:43.997 --> 01:22:45.831
MARISHA: Chili's.
TALIESIN: Free tattoo?

01:22:45.831 --> 01:22:49.617
MATT: Immediately, a crowd of about 10 people

01:22:49.617 --> 01:22:51.587
come rushing to you and two children,

01:22:51.587 --> 01:22:54.187
that all excitedly get,

01:22:54.187 --> 01:22:56.262
really revved up at the idea of a portrait.

01:22:56.262 --> 01:22:58.707
And one by one, you start making the portraits.

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:00.154
Are you giving it to them, or just showing it to them?

01:23:00.154 --> 01:23:01.315
LAURA: I'm going to give it to them.

01:23:01.315 --> 01:23:02.815
MATT: Okay, with each one you give--

01:23:02.815 --> 01:23:03.767
Are you doing them really well,

01:23:03.767 --> 01:23:05.697
or are doing them goofy, what's your intent?

01:23:05.697 --> 01:23:06.987
LAURA: I'm going to, if I--

01:23:06.987 --> 01:23:07.820
SAM: Big-head, little body.

01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.947
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, it's got to be!

01:23:08.947 --> 01:23:10.137
SAM: Big head, little body?

01:23:10.137 --> 01:23:10.970
MARISHA: Caricature.

01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:12.247
LAURA: Some of them I'll do caricatures,

01:23:12.247 --> 01:23:14.947
and then some of them I'll do, like, if I like them,

01:23:14.947 --> 01:23:18.771
I'm going to do a really nice, pretty, realistic drawing.

01:23:18.771 --> 01:23:19.612
MATT: Okay, awesome.

01:23:19.612 --> 01:23:22.947
TALIESIN: We haven't seen a mirror here, have we?

01:23:22.947 --> 01:23:25.477
MATT: Not that you've seen, no.
LIAM: I had that same thought.

01:23:25.477 --> 01:23:27.887
LAURA: I'm going to ask them their names as they come up,

01:23:27.887 --> 01:23:30.347
for the portraits.

01:23:30.347 --> 01:23:33.177
MARISHA: You should ask if they have a favorite hobby, too,

01:23:33.177 --> 01:23:34.737
so you can like--

01:23:34.737 --> 01:23:36.695
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to ask them what they do,

01:23:36.695 --> 01:23:37.820
yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Skateboard.

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.502
ASHLEY: Good idea.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:23:39.502 --> 01:23:40.787
MARISHA: With their little bodies.
LAURA: Definitely.

01:23:40.787 --> 01:23:43.355
LIAM: (goofy voice) I love humbling myself before Vokodo.

01:23:43.355 --> 01:23:45.182
(laughter)

01:23:45.182 --> 01:23:47.697
MATT: I'm a fan of that, too!

01:23:47.697 --> 01:23:48.984
TALIESIN: Volcano's in the background.

01:23:48.984 --> 01:23:50.357
LAURA: Yeah, a lot of volcanoes in the background.

01:23:50.357 --> 01:23:51.578
MATT: It's just a bunch of them.

01:23:51.578 --> 01:23:53.647
(laughter)

01:23:53.647 --> 01:23:56.007
Yeah, they give you their names,

01:23:56.007 --> 01:23:57.967
it's a fun little conversation.

01:23:57.967 --> 01:23:59.137
They all seem to be genuinely enthralled,

01:23:59.137 --> 01:24:00.137
and asking you questions.

01:24:00.137 --> 01:24:01.477
All of them are like, they're here,

01:24:01.477 --> 01:24:03.067
the portrait's fun, and they're excited about it,

01:24:03.067 --> 01:24:04.467
but they're also just excited to talk to you,

01:24:04.467 --> 01:24:05.737
and a lot of them are asking like, "Where're you from?"

01:24:05.737 --> 01:24:08.627
"What brought you here?" It's a lot of just

01:24:08.627 --> 01:24:13.067
general enthusiasm for having new blood in the village.

01:24:13.067 --> 01:24:15.427
LAURA: I make sure a little drawing of a dick

01:24:15.427 --> 01:24:16.937
is on every single picture.

01:24:16.937 --> 01:24:18.057
MATT: Okay.

01:24:18.057 --> 01:24:19.937
LAURA: Except for the kids.

01:24:19.937 --> 01:24:21.337
TRAVIS: They get a happy bean.

01:24:21.337 --> 01:24:23.947
(laughter)

01:24:23.947 --> 01:24:25.367
LAURA: They get the Traveler.

01:24:25.367 --> 01:24:26.296
MATT: Okay.

01:24:26.296 --> 01:24:28.357
LAURA: Like, a little, tiny Traveler.

01:24:28.357 --> 01:24:29.399
LIAM: Also shaped like a dick.

01:24:29.399 --> 01:24:31.017
(laughter)

01:24:31.017 --> 01:24:32.317
TALIESIN: Wearing a cloak, and a hood.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:34.487
LAURA: But not so blatant, you know.

01:24:34.487 --> 01:24:35.320
MATT: Right.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:36.993
TRAVIS: That's so trap.

01:24:36.993 --> 01:24:37.842
MATT: Tasteful trap.
LAURA: I make sure every

01:24:37.842 --> 01:24:41.848
single person gets a blessing upon them.

01:24:41.848 --> 01:24:42.681
MATT: All righty.

01:24:42.681 --> 01:24:43.879
SAM: Any B.V.s? Any B.V.s?

01:24:43.879 --> 01:24:45.064
LAURA: Any B.V.s? Any B.V.?

01:24:45.064 --> 01:24:47.117
MATT: No B.V.s, no.

01:24:47.117 --> 01:24:49.427
In fact, everyone's giving just a first name.

01:24:49.427 --> 01:24:50.877
There's no surnames.

01:24:52.297 --> 01:24:55.105
LAURA: But I'm going: What's your last name, though?

01:24:56.187 --> 01:24:57.603
MATT: "Just the name."

01:24:57.603 --> 01:25:01.617
And the next person's like, "Same, just a name."

01:25:01.617 --> 01:25:03.557
LAURA: Any B names?

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:04.557
MATT: In this group, no.

01:25:07.514 --> 01:25:08.567
(laughter)

01:25:08.567 --> 01:25:11.387
SAM: Our perfect plan is being foiled!

01:25:11.387 --> 01:25:13.387
TALIESIN: I mean, it was a good plan.

01:25:13.387 --> 01:25:14.907
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: A really good plan.

01:25:14.907 --> 01:25:18.527
LAURA: I am enjoying the practice though, on these drawings.

01:25:18.527 --> 01:25:19.485
TALIESIN: Tiny butt.
LAURA: Yasha, you should

01:25:19.485 --> 01:25:20.743
play some music for them!

01:25:20.743 --> 01:25:23.793
ASHLEY: Well, I was going to see if I could

01:25:23.793 --> 01:25:26.926
go somewhere off to

01:25:26.926 --> 01:25:29.085
the side a little bit, somewhere in private,

01:25:29.085 --> 01:25:31.817
where I could make sure that the harp is tuned,

01:25:31.817 --> 01:25:34.327
and warm up my fingers a little bit.

01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:35.160
MATT: Yeah.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.377
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you were going to go look for a B.

01:25:37.847 --> 01:25:39.687
MATT: Easy enough to do.
LAURA: I think, time to go.

01:25:39.687 --> 01:25:42.257
MATT: You take the time, you tune it
to the best of your ability

01:25:42.257 --> 01:25:46.094
with the experience you have practicing on your own time

01:25:46.094 --> 01:25:48.957
without direct tutelage, but more just,

01:25:48.957 --> 01:25:50.921
figuring it out as you go.

01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:51.754
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:25:51.754 --> 01:25:53.547
MATT: You feel pretty warmed up

01:25:53.547 --> 01:25:57.657
as you could imagine you could be, for such a circumstance.

01:25:57.657 --> 01:25:58.490
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:25:59.667 --> 01:26:01.527
MATT: All right, Nott, are you doing anything?

01:26:01.527 --> 01:26:02.837
LAURA: I'm going to--
SAM: I'm invisible.

01:26:02.837 --> 01:26:03.677
MATT: Well you're invisible, chilling.

01:26:03.677 --> 01:26:05.407
SAM: I'm just hanging around Jester,

01:26:05.407 --> 01:26:06.997
unless Beau does something more interesting,

01:26:06.997 --> 01:26:09.747
then I'll go with her.
(laughter)

01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:10.987
MATT: Beau, what are you doing?

01:26:12.347 --> 01:26:14.930
MARISHA: First, I go over and

01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:16.938
I try and punch the globule of light

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:19.627
that Caleb produced, because I've never done it.

01:26:19.627 --> 01:26:20.907
I've never, like, touched it.

01:26:20.907 --> 01:26:23.854
Is it like, can I punch it, does it go away?

01:26:23.854 --> 01:26:25.474
(laughter)
TRAVIS: 10d12!

01:26:25.474 --> 01:26:26.825
TALIESIN: This is the most stove-cat moment I've ever-

01:26:26.825 --> 01:26:29.997
TRAVIS: (explosion)
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

01:26:29.997 --> 01:26:33.577
No, you punch it, and it reacts faintly.

01:26:33.577 --> 01:26:35.317
Like, it shimmers a bit as your fist goes through,

01:26:35.317 --> 01:26:38.827
but it is immaterial. It's like punching a light sunbeam,

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:41.647
where your fist warms slightly while it's in the sunbeam,

01:26:41.647 --> 01:26:44.077
but you don't sense anything beyond just that

01:26:44.077 --> 01:26:44.948
slight change in temperature.

01:26:44.948 --> 01:26:46.304
TALIESIN: (explosion)

01:26:46.304 --> 01:26:47.797
MARISHA: I take out one of those bottle rockets,

01:26:47.797 --> 01:26:51.107
and I hold the wick in the globule. Does anything happen?

01:26:51.107 --> 01:26:52.773
MATT: No.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:26:52.773 --> 01:26:53.757
TALIESIN: That was interesting.

01:26:53.757 --> 01:26:56.277
MARISHA: That would've been cool.
TALIESIN: That would've been real cool.

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:58.317
LIAM: Are you amusing yourself?

01:26:58.317 --> 01:27:00.484
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah?

01:27:00.484 --> 01:27:01.325
MARISHA: A little bored.

01:27:01.325 --> 01:27:02.983
I think I'm going to go give this to a kid,

01:27:02.983 --> 01:27:05.037
I'll be right back. Is there a kid?

01:27:05.037 --> 01:27:07.367
MATT: There are a number of kids around, yeah.

01:27:07.367 --> 01:27:10.801
MARISHA: Okay, I want to-- is there an approachable,

01:27:10.801 --> 01:27:13.117
inviting-looking kid, because?

01:27:13.117 --> 01:27:16.097
MATT: Yeah, you see one kid, probably,

01:27:16.977 --> 01:27:20.717
appears to be human, maybe no older than seven.

01:27:20.717 --> 01:27:21.550
MARISHA: Perfect.

01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:23.457
MATT: He's just running by with a stick in one hand,

01:27:23.457 --> 01:27:25.207
his feet are muddy beneath the knees.

01:27:25.207 --> 01:27:26.437
He has a little bit of a smear of dirt

01:27:26.437 --> 01:27:28.565
on the side of the face.

01:27:28.565 --> 01:27:31.377
He runs by, and sees you looking at him,

01:27:31.377 --> 01:27:33.727
and he stops and just looks at you.

01:27:33.727 --> 01:27:35.997
MARISHA: Hey, I have a big stick, too.

01:27:35.997 --> 01:27:37.197
Check mine out.

01:27:37.197 --> 01:27:38.030
MATT: "That's pretty cool."

01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:39.103
MARISHA: Yeah, you want to hold it?

01:27:39.103 --> 01:27:40.101
MATT: "Yeah."

01:27:40.101 --> 01:27:41.007
MARISHA: You know what, can I hold your stick?

01:27:41.007 --> 01:27:42.677
MATT: "Sure."
MARISHA: Okay, I'll trade you.

01:27:42.677 --> 01:27:43.567
Cool.

01:27:43.567 --> 01:27:44.400
MATT: "Thanks," and he just--

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.017
MARISHA: No, no, no, come here, come here, come here!

01:27:46.017 --> 01:27:46.850
MATT: "What?"

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.767
MARISHA: That's mine, you can't take it.

01:27:48.767 --> 01:27:49.637
MATT: "Okay."

01:27:49.637 --> 01:27:51.697
MARISHA: I can show you cool stuff with it, though.

01:27:51.697 --> 01:27:52.530
MATT: "Like what?"

01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:53.457
MARISHA: Do you know how to fight?

01:27:54.317 --> 01:27:57.087
MATT: "Yeah. "
MARISHA: Here, kid, give it back.

01:27:57.087 --> 01:27:58.497
I'll trade you back, here's your stick.

01:27:58.497 --> 01:27:59.805
Yeah, there we go.

01:27:59.805 --> 01:28:03.267
And I do, like, a little twirl behind my back.

01:28:03.267 --> 01:28:04.297
MATT: "That's cool!"

01:28:04.297 --> 01:28:06.139
He attempts it and immediately, like, breaks the stick,

01:28:06.139 --> 01:28:07.689
and, like, hits his leg and he's like,

01:28:07.689 --> 01:28:09.177
"(inhales) Yeah!"

01:28:09.177 --> 01:28:10.997
MARISHA: Yeah, that was pretty good!

01:28:10.997 --> 01:28:13.366
What's your job on this island?

01:28:13.366 --> 01:28:15.157
MATT: "I take care of

01:28:16.317 --> 01:28:18.217
"keeping the monsters away."

01:28:18.217 --> 01:28:19.532
MARISHA: Really?
MATT: "Yeah."

01:28:19.532 --> 01:28:21.257
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "Yeah."

01:28:21.257 --> 01:28:23.874
MARISHA: Awesome, you're, like, a guard, work the patrol.

01:28:23.874 --> 01:28:24.847
MATT: "Yeah."
MARISHA: What's your name?

01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:25.837
MATT: "Treece."

01:28:25.837 --> 01:28:28.058
MARISHA: How long have you-- were you born here, Treece?

01:28:28.058 --> 01:28:29.307
MATT: "Yeah."

01:28:29.307 --> 01:28:30.247
MARISHA: That's awesome.

01:28:30.247 --> 01:28:34.897
What is, like, the goal of your village, do you know?

01:28:34.897 --> 01:28:36.617
Do you have like--
(laughter)

01:28:36.617 --> 01:28:38.795
a mission?

01:28:38.795 --> 01:28:40.037
LAURA: He's like six.

01:28:40.037 --> 01:28:41.947
MATT: He wipes the snot from under his nose.

01:28:41.947 --> 01:28:44.917
MARISHA: What's your social-economical contribution?

01:28:44.917 --> 01:28:46.479
SAM: You're a kid What's the purpose of life?

01:28:46.479 --> 01:28:48.847
(laughter)

01:28:48.847 --> 01:28:49.680
TALIESIN: Pride of the city council.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.186
MATT: He stares at you blankly a bit, and goes,

01:28:52.186 --> 01:28:56.119
"I don't know, fight monsters, and

01:28:56.119 --> 01:28:57.869
"make that thing happy?"

01:28:57.869 --> 01:28:58.863
And he points to the mountain.

01:28:58.863 --> 01:29:01.567
MARISHA: What do you give to make that thing happy?

01:29:01.567 --> 01:29:02.877
MATT: "I don't really give anything.

01:29:02.877 --> 01:29:04.887
"My mom and dad make stuff to give."

01:29:04.887 --> 01:29:06.527
MARISHA: Oh, like what?

01:29:06.527 --> 01:29:08.857
MATT: "Like, they make carvings, and--"

01:29:08.857 --> 01:29:11.917
MARISHA: Yeah?
MATT: "-- and sculpt things."

01:29:11.917 --> 01:29:12.750
MARISHA: That's cool.

01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.977
MATT: "I've--"
MARISHA: Do you want to-- go ahead.

01:29:14.977 --> 01:29:19.318
MATT: "I have a friend whose family, they all go down to the

01:29:19.318 --> 01:29:23.522
"big mouth to mine."
LAURA: (whispering) Hey, what was the name of the--

01:29:23.522 --> 01:29:25.807
MARISHA: Oh yeah?
MATT: "Yeah."

01:29:25.807 --> 01:29:28.232
MARISHA: How often do people not come back?

01:29:29.187 --> 01:29:32.915
Not to, like, bring up, like, a downer subject.

01:29:34.527 --> 01:29:36.527
MATT: "I should probably get going."

01:29:36.527 --> 01:29:38.668
MARISHA: Hey, you want to light this bottle rocket?

01:29:38.668 --> 01:29:39.867
You want to see it explode?

01:29:39.867 --> 01:29:40.987
TRAVIS: You going to offer him a lollipop, too,

01:29:40.987 --> 01:29:42.128
and tell him to get in the van?
MATT: "Yeah."

01:29:42.128 --> 01:29:43.445
MARISHA: Okay, here, come here.

01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:45.253
And I light the bottle rocket.

01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:48.451
MATT: (whizzing)

01:29:48.451 --> 01:29:49.292
(explosion)

01:29:49.292 --> 01:29:50.706
You see four people all of a sudden turn around

01:29:50.706 --> 01:29:53.264
and goes, "(screaming)"
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh, no!

01:29:53.264 --> 01:29:55.557
MARISHA: A person goes, like, running for a bell.

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:56.814
MARISHA: Oh, you don't have to--

01:29:56.814 --> 01:29:58.241
MATT: And they stop.
MARISHA: It's cool.

01:29:58.241 --> 01:30:00.627
MATT: He's like, "That's so cool,
do you have more of those?"

01:30:00.627 --> 01:30:02.277
MARISHA: I do, here!

01:30:02.277 --> 01:30:03.834
And I give him, like, six!

01:30:03.834 --> 01:30:05.377
(laughter)

01:30:05.377 --> 01:30:09.897
Just, hey, don't, like, do anything too bad with them,

01:30:09.897 --> 01:30:12.807
and make sure that you're not holding them when they go off,

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:15.893
and don't point them at other children or your parents.

01:30:15.893 --> 01:30:18.147
MATT: "But anybody else, I can?"

01:30:18.147 --> 01:30:19.077
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: (laughs)

01:30:19.077 --> 01:30:20.297
MATT: "Cool."

01:30:20.297 --> 01:30:23.380
MARISHA: Totally, man. They're great.
MATT: "What's your name?"

01:30:26.627 --> 01:30:27.860
MARISHA: I'm Beau.

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:30.147
I was trying to think of something cool, but I'm Beau.

01:30:30.147 --> 01:30:32.487
MATT: "Beau's pretty cool, you can go with that."

01:30:32.487 --> 01:30:33.677
MARISHA: Thanks, Treece.

01:30:33.677 --> 01:30:34.510
MATT: "Thanks."

01:30:36.907 --> 01:30:38.567
MARISHA: Okay, bye. I never know how to end

01:30:38.567 --> 01:30:40.750
conversations with kids! Bye, Treece.

01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:42.847
MATT: "Bye," and he just runs off.

01:30:42.847 --> 01:30:45.290
Staring at the bottle rockets, super excited.

01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:46.687
TRAVIS: Give him a 12 pack of beer.

01:30:46.687 --> 01:30:47.897
MARISHA: Hey, Veth?

01:30:47.897 --> 01:30:48.827
SAM: What?
MARISHA: Veth, can you hear me?

01:30:48.827 --> 01:30:50.110
SAM: Yeah. Yep.

01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:51.237
MARISHA: Do you want to go snoop around in the kitchen

01:30:51.237 --> 01:30:52.687
and see what they might have in the back?

01:30:52.687 --> 01:30:53.897
SAM: Sure, yeah, sure.

01:30:53.897 --> 01:30:55.197
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to go distract people.

01:30:55.197 --> 01:30:58.497
SAM: Are you going to go fuck with some more kids?

01:30:58.497 --> 01:30:59.820
MARISHA: I mean, I could also do that, probably.

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:00.997
SAM: No, let's go to the kitchens.

01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:02.130
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:03.227
And I go meet up with Caduceus.

01:31:03.227 --> 01:31:04.060
MATT: Okay.

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:06.297
TALIESIN: I was half-expecting you
to say your name was Jester.

01:31:06.297 --> 01:31:08.064
MARISHA: I should-- oh fuck!

01:31:08.064 --> 01:31:09.409
LAURA: Man!
MARISHA: That's what I should've done!

01:31:09.409 --> 01:31:12.024
TALIESIN: I was watching, I was waiting.

01:31:12.024 --> 01:31:13.207
MATT: All right, you go to the kitchen,

01:31:13.207 --> 01:31:14.040
things are being prepared.

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.549
You do see another hunting party arrive.

01:31:16.549 --> 01:31:18.647
This is a larger hunting party,

01:31:18.647 --> 01:31:22.219
unlike the dual team of Pono and Jaina.

01:31:22.219 --> 01:31:26.557
You see five folks arriving, along with a figure

01:31:26.557 --> 01:31:27.902
that resembles the description

01:31:27.902 --> 01:31:30.010
that you had received of Terra,

01:31:30.997 --> 01:31:34.847
who is a firbolg, taller than Caduceus.

01:31:34.847 --> 01:31:35.997
LIAM: Ooh.

01:31:35.997 --> 01:31:40.997
MATT: Female, very long, lanky arms and legs,

01:31:41.177 --> 01:31:44.667
but very muscular and taut.

01:31:44.667 --> 01:31:47.597
And a hide, leather-based hunting outfit

01:31:47.597 --> 01:31:49.942
with a longbow strapped across the shoulder and the back.

01:31:49.942 --> 01:31:51.469
LAURA: Tight!

01:31:52.877 --> 01:31:55.567
MATT: She's older, she definitely-- in the face,

01:31:55.567 --> 01:31:58.410
you can see there's a hardness, an age to it.

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:03.457
The fur across the body is a blue-gray color.

01:32:03.457 --> 01:32:05.657
Shoulder-length white hair, like a mop,

01:32:05.657 --> 01:32:08.607
that cuts off and tangles a bit towards there.

01:32:10.127 --> 01:32:11.237
Pretty intense.

01:32:11.237 --> 01:32:12.677
But what catches your eye immediately after

01:32:12.677 --> 01:32:14.497
is what they're dragging in.

01:32:14.497 --> 01:32:17.297
You see brought to the other bonfire,

01:32:17.297 --> 01:32:20.107
two large, scaled beasts.

01:32:21.037 --> 01:32:23.987
Lizard-like, but probably eight to nine feet

01:32:23.987 --> 01:32:26.842
from nose to tail.

01:32:28.247 --> 01:32:31.857
You see elements of feather at certain edges of the limbs.

01:32:31.857 --> 01:32:34.247
You can see clawed arms that fall into one side

01:32:34.247 --> 01:32:38.007
and large, spindly, muscular legs,

01:32:38.007 --> 01:32:40.792
that keep it, and a jaw of teeth.

01:32:43.078 --> 01:32:44.194
LAURA: Have we ever seen anything--?

01:32:44.194 --> 01:32:45.617
MATT: You've never seen a creature like this.

01:32:47.707 --> 01:32:49.628
TALIESIN: What the Sam Hill?

01:32:49.628 --> 01:32:52.287
TRAVIS: I'm still butchering with Pono and Jaina, right?

01:32:52.287 --> 01:32:53.120
MATT: Yeah.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.637
TRAVIS: What is that?!

01:32:54.637 --> 01:32:56.620
MATT: They look up, and Jaina goes,

01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:59.679
"Oh, fucking hell, really?"

01:32:59.679 --> 01:33:02.767
And the hunting party waves over, and they go--

01:33:02.767 --> 01:33:03.917
TRAVIS: Have we been outdone?

01:33:04.949 --> 01:33:06.327
MATT: (sighs) "You could say that.

01:33:06.327 --> 01:33:07.915
"It's fine, it's whatever,"

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.384
and they get back to cutting.

01:33:09.384 --> 01:33:12.310
TRAVIS: What was the thing that they're bringing in?

01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:14.410
MATT: "I don't even know what it's called, but--"

01:33:15.967 --> 01:33:17.751
TRAVIS: You don't know what it's called?

01:33:17.751 --> 01:33:19.160
MATT: "No."
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:21.929
(clears throat)

01:33:24.177 --> 01:33:27.167
The rest of the party, who's with--?
(laughter)

01:33:27.167 --> 01:33:28.861
Who's with Terra?

01:33:32.537 --> 01:33:35.367
MATT: "It's Garrenat and his crew.

01:33:35.367 --> 01:33:37.267
"There's two other hunting parties that are out,

01:33:37.267 --> 01:33:38.507
"I don't know if they're going to come back."

01:33:38.507 --> 01:33:39.367
TRAVIS: Garrenat?

01:33:39.367 --> 01:33:43.396
MATT: "Garrenat is her right-hand man.

01:33:46.227 --> 01:33:47.507
"Sons of bitches,"

01:33:47.507 --> 01:33:49.327
and they grumble and they go back to cutting.

01:33:49.327 --> 01:33:50.947
LAURA: Why do they care who gets the biggest?

01:33:50.947 --> 01:33:54.327
TRAVIS: I think it's just some good-natured competitiveness.

01:33:54.327 --> 01:33:55.160
LAURA: Is it?

01:33:56.427 --> 01:33:57.260
TRAVIS: I think so.

01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.657
(laughter)

01:33:58.657 --> 01:34:00.627
Strange beasts in these woods.
MARISHA: Vokodo!

01:34:00.627 --> 01:34:02.207
TALIESIN: I feel like we're in one of those villages

01:34:02.207 --> 01:34:04.707
in a video game where you run through every single

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:07.033
question tree.

01:34:07.033 --> 01:34:08.033
SAM: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:34:08.033 --> 01:34:08.937
(laughter)

01:34:08.937 --> 01:34:11.644
TALIESIN: Just, "Good luck on your mission going forward."

01:34:11.644 --> 01:34:12.748
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:34:12.748 --> 01:34:16.067
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find a bathroom.
"Good luck on your--"

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:17.817
LIAM: I hear there's creatures on the edge of the wood.

01:34:17.817 --> 01:34:19.043
TALIESIN: Thank you!

01:34:19.043 --> 01:34:20.919
What are they called? (noncommittal noises)

01:34:20.919 --> 01:34:22.547
TRAVIS: Can I see any of the other Mighty Nein

01:34:22.547 --> 01:34:24.647
from where I'm butchering, and I can see this?

01:34:24.647 --> 01:34:26.907
MATT: Yeah, you can see Caduceus and Beauregard.

01:34:26.907 --> 01:34:28.367
They're currently in the process of preparing

01:34:28.367 --> 01:34:32.611
the non-meat elements of tonight's meal.

01:34:32.611 --> 01:34:36.330
TRAVIS: Caduceus, Beau, will you join me in greeting

01:34:36.330 --> 01:34:38.548
Terra and the rest of the hunting party?

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:39.547
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

01:34:39.547 --> 01:34:40.837
TALIESIN: I'll be right back.

01:34:40.837 --> 01:34:42.747
TRAVIS: Unless you're doing something important, Beau?

01:34:42.747 --> 01:34:43.762
MARISHA: No.

01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:45.867
TALIESIN: I mean, this-- but, you know, fine.

01:34:45.867 --> 01:34:47.857
MARISHA: Okay. Veth!

01:34:47.857 --> 01:34:48.690
SAM: Yeah? Oh yeah.

01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:50.257
Sorry, I was dozing off there for a second.

01:34:50.257 --> 01:34:52.207
MARISHA: Do you want to come or are you going to stay?

01:34:52.207 --> 01:34:53.040
SAM: Yeah, I'll come with you.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.699
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, that's weird.

01:34:54.699 --> 01:34:55.615
MARISHA: Hmm?

01:34:55.615 --> 01:34:57.655
TALIESIN: I didn't know Veth was here.

01:34:57.655 --> 01:34:59.589
TRAVIS: Hello? Hello!

01:35:00.587 --> 01:35:03.607
MATT: They're now taking one of these creatures

01:35:03.607 --> 01:35:06.557
and tying its arms and legs upside down,

01:35:06.557 --> 01:35:09.077
crossed over this large bar,

01:35:09.077 --> 01:35:10.759
similar to the one that they were

01:35:10.759 --> 01:35:13.247
briefly putting the displacer beast on

01:35:13.247 --> 01:35:14.677
before they started butchering it.

01:35:14.677 --> 01:35:19.557
And a woman turns around and looks at your crew. "Ah."

01:35:19.557 --> 01:35:21.457
TALIESIN: That's crazy, what do you call that?

01:35:22.487 --> 01:35:23.337
MATT: "This here is

01:35:24.607 --> 01:35:26.397
"one of many dangerous beasts,

01:35:26.397 --> 01:35:29.157
"long-lost beasts on the north side of the island."

01:35:29.157 --> 01:35:31.107
TALIESIN: I got to learn not to do that, yeah.

01:35:31.107 --> 01:35:31.997
It's amazing.

01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:37.274
MATT: Make sure and look up the actual
pronunciation for it here, yeah.

01:35:38.133 --> 01:35:41.141
"Deinonychus is what it's known as in some places."
SAM: Deinonychus?

01:35:41.141 --> 01:35:42.424
TRAVIS: It's a fucking dinosaur!
LAURA: Ooh!

01:35:42.424 --> 01:35:44.099
TALIESIN: We have a noun.

01:35:45.193 --> 01:35:46.210
LIAM: Yep.

01:35:47.477 --> 01:35:48.987
TRAVIS: I wanted to introduce ourselves;

01:35:48.987 --> 01:35:51.897
I know we may seem like strange faces.

01:35:51.897 --> 01:35:56.317
We were actually saved in the forest by Pono and Jaina.

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:57.897
MATT: "We heard there was some new arrivals.

01:35:57.897 --> 01:36:00.757
"I assume that's you all lot?"

01:36:00.757 --> 01:36:03.007
TRAVIS: That's us. Well, just a few of us, at least.

01:36:04.207 --> 01:36:07.848
MATT: "Well, welcome to Vo, happy to have you."

01:36:07.848 --> 01:36:09.587
TALIESIN: It's very impressive, thank you.

01:36:09.587 --> 01:36:10.747
Caduceus Clay.

01:36:10.747 --> 01:36:12.307
MATT: "Caduceus. You are?"

01:36:12.307 --> 01:36:14.017
MARISHA: Beau.
MATT: "Beau."

01:36:14.017 --> 01:36:15.937
TRAVIS: I'm Fjord.
MATT: "Fjord.

01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:16.770
"I'm Terra.

01:36:18.067 --> 01:36:19.117
"What are you good at?"

01:36:22.867 --> 01:36:24.845
TRAVIS: Well, nobody speak all at the same time.

01:36:24.845 --> 01:36:26.207
TALIESIN: I think you can just say, "I don't know."

01:36:26.207 --> 01:36:28.267
It seems to be the normal answer to everything.

01:36:28.267 --> 01:36:30.427
MARISHA: Well, technically we're good at fighting,

01:36:30.427 --> 01:36:32.737
and killing people, but that feels like,

01:36:32.737 --> 01:36:34.187
maybe something you shouldn't lead with.

01:36:34.187 --> 01:36:35.637
We're good at killing people.

01:36:36.747 --> 01:36:38.279
TALIESIN: I can't really remember.
MATT: "Just people?"

01:36:38.279 --> 01:36:42.007
MARISHA: No, no, no, like, bad things

01:36:42.007 --> 01:36:44.267
that need to be killed. So like monsters, beasts.

01:36:44.267 --> 01:36:45.607
TRAVIS: We're fair hunters.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:36:45.607 --> 01:36:48.027
TRAVIS: I have some skill with sailing on the open waters.

01:36:48.027 --> 01:36:49.977
Caduceus is actually a very talented...

01:36:50.907 --> 01:36:51.740
TALIESIN: Cook.

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.131
TRAVIS: Cook.

01:36:53.131 --> 01:36:54.237
Healer.

01:36:54.237 --> 01:36:56.147
TALIESIN: Yeah, that too.

01:36:56.147 --> 01:36:58.257
MATT: "Good."
TRAVIS: Makes an excellent tea.

01:36:58.257 --> 01:37:00.597
MATT: "We could use more muscle on the hunting teams,

01:37:00.597 --> 01:37:02.087
"that's good to know."

01:37:02.087 --> 01:37:06.117
TRAVIS: Oh, we actually just stopped for a visit.

01:37:06.117 --> 01:37:09.267
We're not actually planning on joining the community,

01:37:09.267 --> 01:37:11.137
we were actually just done a great favor

01:37:11.137 --> 01:37:13.499
by some your hunting party.

01:37:13.499 --> 01:37:14.332
MATT: "All right."

01:37:14.332 --> 01:37:15.717
TRAVIS: We don't plan to be staying very long.

01:37:15.717 --> 01:37:16.657
MATT: "Understood."
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:37:16.657 --> 01:37:19.377
MATT: "If that changes, let me know, we could always use

01:37:19.377 --> 01:37:21.062
"some more hands out."

01:37:21.062 --> 01:37:22.968
TRAVIS: Of course.

01:37:22.968 --> 01:37:24.427
Well, it sounds like we'll be staying for dinner,

01:37:24.427 --> 01:37:25.697
we wanted to introduce ourselves,

01:37:25.697 --> 01:37:27.697
you'll meet the rest of our party later.

01:37:29.637 --> 01:37:31.487
We're at your service.

01:37:31.487 --> 01:37:33.790
MATT: "Good, we'll talk at dinner."

01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:35.057
TALIESIN: I go back to chopping.

01:37:35.057 --> 01:37:37.038
MARISHA: Thanks for your hospitality.

01:37:37.038 --> 01:37:38.947
MATT: She just walks back over towards

01:37:38.947 --> 01:37:40.227
where they're stringing up the beasts,

01:37:40.227 --> 01:37:41.287
and helping her team out.

01:37:41.287 --> 01:37:43.062
TRAVIS: Oh, she's hard.
MARISHA: She's tough, she's tough, yeah.

01:37:43.062 --> 01:37:45.296
TRAVIS: Yeah she's got, like, worn leather.

01:37:45.296 --> 01:37:46.917
MARISHA: Yeah, she's, you know-- I like her.

01:37:46.917 --> 01:37:49.364
TRAVIS: It's a rough whiskey.
MARISHA: Yep, yep, yep.

01:37:52.357 --> 01:37:54.760
TRAVIS: Cool, cool cool, cool.

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.947
I'm going to go cut up this displacer beast.

01:37:55.947 --> 01:37:57.430
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to go...

01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:58.888
make sure stuff isn't poisoned.

01:37:58.888 --> 01:38:00.937
TRAVIS: Have you ever seen a deinonychus before?

01:38:00.937 --> 01:38:01.770
MARISHA: No!

01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:05.897
That feels like paleolithic, like a different time.

01:38:05.897 --> 01:38:07.077
TRAVIS: What word did you say?

01:38:07.077 --> 01:38:09.593
MARISHA: Like, you know, before the earth--

01:38:09.593 --> 01:38:11.726
before Exandria was, like, Exandria.

01:38:11.726 --> 01:38:14.278
MATT: You can make a history or nature check, your choice.

01:38:14.278 --> 01:38:16.001
TRAVIS: Almost like the land <i>before</i> time?

01:38:16.001 --> 01:38:18.537
MARISHA: Time, yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:38:18.537 --> 01:38:19.437
A history check?

01:38:19.437 --> 01:38:20.827
TALIESIN: And the time before land.

01:38:20.827 --> 01:38:22.225
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:38:22.225 --> 01:38:24.026
(cheering)

01:38:24.026 --> 01:38:26.777
TALIESIN: Where has this been for,
like, the last three years?

01:38:26.777 --> 01:38:29.837
MARISHA: I don't know. So 32.

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:31.017
MATT: Yeah, okay.

01:38:31.017 --> 01:38:33.350
(laughter)

01:38:34.327 --> 01:38:37.677
MATT: You are a very studied individual,

01:38:37.677 --> 01:38:39.353
in eclectic things.

01:38:39.353 --> 01:38:40.787
In the Cobalt Soul you had

01:38:40.787 --> 01:38:42.307
less interest in modern-day politics

01:38:42.307 --> 01:38:45.977
and more interest in books about weird things

01:38:45.977 --> 01:38:47.397
that had drawings and pictures.

01:38:47.397 --> 01:38:48.667
MARISHA: That's why I took Deep Speech.

01:38:48.667 --> 01:38:50.307
MATT: Exactly.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:38:50.307 --> 01:38:52.207
MATT: But during this time you came across

01:38:53.735 --> 01:38:56.487
myths and stories about beasts,

01:38:56.487 --> 01:38:59.007
very similar to the ones that you saw strung up here.

01:38:59.007 --> 01:39:00.497
Things that were said to exist

01:39:00.497 --> 01:39:02.387
during the time of the Titans.

01:39:02.387 --> 01:39:03.817
Things that were largely wiped out,

01:39:03.817 --> 01:39:07.727
except for, supposedly, in some far reaches of Exandria,

01:39:07.727 --> 01:39:09.227
might still exist,

01:39:09.227 --> 01:39:12.287
of all manner of size and demeanor.

01:39:12.287 --> 01:39:15.267
Most people seem to say that elements of them

01:39:15.267 --> 01:39:17.507
might still reside still within the Shattered Teeth,

01:39:17.507 --> 01:39:21.877
but few have been able to provide proof.

01:39:22.807 --> 01:39:25.987
And this is your first time you've ever seen something

01:39:25.987 --> 01:39:28.980
very similar to what you studied first-hand.

01:39:30.517 --> 01:39:35.417
MARISHA: Ooh. Yeah, they're like
bogeymen, like big fish stories.

01:39:35.417 --> 01:39:39.187
Like you're not entirely sure if they even exist, you know?

01:39:39.187 --> 01:39:41.157
TRAVIS: That's not helpful at all.

01:39:41.157 --> 01:39:43.987
MARISHA: I mean, this shit is
ancient, whatever that thing is,

01:39:43.987 --> 01:39:44.877
that's all I'm saying.

01:39:44.877 --> 01:39:47.207
TRAVIS: Oh, you mean as if it's
not supposed to exist anymore?

01:39:47.207 --> 01:39:48.647
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of.
TRAVIS: But it does.

01:39:48.647 --> 01:39:50.167
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:50.167 --> 01:39:52.619
Like, pre-Calamity?

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.637
MATT: Oh, yeah, very pre-Calamity.

01:39:53.637 --> 01:39:57.787
MARISHA: Way pre-Calamity time, like way--

01:39:57.787 --> 01:40:00.195
SAM: We got to get up to the north side!
TALIESIN: It's, like, a lost creature?

01:40:00.195 --> 01:40:01.236
SAM: Hi, Fjord, I'm here, too.

01:40:01.236 --> 01:40:03.555
TRAVIS: Ah, I know, I can see you, I can See Invisibility.

01:40:03.555 --> 01:40:06.497
(laughter)
SAM: Oh, I forgot!

01:40:06.497 --> 01:40:07.330
LAURA: Still?

01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:09.377
TRAVIS: Couldn't cut you-- well, for an hour.

01:40:09.377 --> 01:40:10.787
MATT: It's passed by now.
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:40:10.787 --> 01:40:12.725
Well then, Veth?
(laughter)

01:40:12.725 --> 01:40:15.067
SAM: Well, then I'm no longer invisible, either.

01:40:15.067 --> 01:40:17.247
MATT: Well, you can keep it up
if you have more spell slots, but--

01:40:17.247 --> 01:40:18.080
SAM: I do.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.745
ASHLEY: We got to go to the north side!

01:40:19.745 --> 01:40:20.757
SAM: Yeah, we got to go to the north side!

01:40:20.757 --> 01:40:23.375
TRAVIS: The north side, bro. It's where it's at. Rip curl!

01:40:23.375 --> 01:40:24.883
(laughter)

01:40:24.883 --> 01:40:26.214
ASHLEY: Let's go, north shore!

01:40:26.214 --> 01:40:28.067
TRAVIS: North shore.

01:40:28.067 --> 01:40:29.047
TALIESIN: First thing tomorrow morning.

01:40:29.047 --> 01:40:30.204
MATT: So, what's the plan, are you guys--

01:40:30.204 --> 01:40:31.037
anything you want to accomplish,

01:40:31.037 --> 01:40:31.967
or do you want to move onto dinner?

01:40:31.967 --> 01:40:32.807
TRAVIS: I think we're just waiting for dinner now.

01:40:32.807 --> 01:40:36.432
TALIESIN: Is anything suspicious about this food at all? Does it--?

01:40:36.432 --> 01:40:37.607
TRAVIS: You mean while you're in the kitchen?

01:40:37.607 --> 01:40:38.671
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:40:38.671 --> 01:40:40.307
TALIESIN: I'm watching to see if, like, there's any spices

01:40:40.307 --> 01:40:41.877
being added to anything.

01:40:41.877 --> 01:40:43.582
TRAVIS: What's the Health Inspector grade?

01:40:43.582 --> 01:40:45.107
TALIESIN: There seems to be, like, one ingredient

01:40:45.107 --> 01:40:45.940
that's in everything,

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:49.392
like way too much nutmeg on everything.

01:40:49.392 --> 01:40:51.017
MATT: (laughter) Sure.
TRAVIS: (guffawing) Seinfeld!

01:40:51.017 --> 01:40:52.657
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:40:52.657 --> 01:40:54.074
TALIESIN: That's a thing.

01:40:55.807 --> 01:40:56.717
Eh, it's cocked.

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.850
SAM: The stinking rolls.

01:40:59.717 --> 01:41:02.720
TALIESIN: Bad for me, but you know, 17.

01:41:04.276 --> 01:41:07.023
MATT: I mean, beyond the fact that a lot of the...

01:41:09.687 --> 01:41:13.897
the flavor concoctions that are being produced here,

01:41:13.897 --> 01:41:16.037
a lot of the crushed minerals that have been recovered,

01:41:16.037 --> 01:41:19.154
and mingled here are high in sodium.

01:41:19.154 --> 01:41:21.517
Beyond that, nothing that catches your attention as-

01:41:21.517 --> 01:41:22.777
TALIESIN: Monsters.
MATT: Dubious.

01:41:22.777 --> 01:41:24.977
TALIESIN: Just monsters.
MATT: (laughs)

01:41:24.977 --> 01:41:26.997
TALIESIN: So much salt. All right.

01:41:29.457 --> 01:41:31.677
MATT: Eventually, the sun does begin to set.

01:41:31.677 --> 01:41:36.287
The coloration of the sky takes its characteristic

01:41:36.287 --> 01:41:38.777
oranges and purple hues.

01:41:38.777 --> 01:41:41.697
The temperature still, you know,

01:41:41.697 --> 01:41:44.957
not as warm as you'd expect for the location

01:41:44.957 --> 01:41:47.906
and temperate region the island is

01:41:47.906 --> 01:41:50.327
amongst the Swavain Islands.

01:41:50.327 --> 01:41:54.360
The mist remains on the outskirts of the city.

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:57.847
It doesn't seem to swell or get any larger or more dense

01:41:57.847 --> 01:42:02.356
with the temperature dropping. It just exists.

01:42:02.356 --> 01:42:05.597
But people begin to gather as the bonfires ignite,

01:42:05.597 --> 01:42:08.127
as the actual meals begin to cook,

01:42:08.127 --> 01:42:13.126
the creatures are set up to be charred and prepared

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:15.027
and the large bonfire itself,

01:42:15.027 --> 01:42:18.607
just a beacon, the center of the social space here

01:42:18.607 --> 01:42:21.077
at the end of the day, is lit.

01:42:21.077 --> 01:42:22.877
The heat is immense, even from this distance,

01:42:22.877 --> 01:42:24.467
but people gather around.

01:42:24.467 --> 01:42:26.487
And you can watch as people grab stools and stumps,

01:42:26.487 --> 01:42:28.827
and whatever sort of sitting arrangement they have.

01:42:28.827 --> 01:42:32.637
They bring their own plates, which are a weird mix

01:42:32.637 --> 01:42:35.407
of old china that looks chipped or broken in places,

01:42:35.407 --> 01:42:38.957
to just wooden plates that have been carved

01:42:38.957 --> 01:42:40.297
from whatever they could find locally,

01:42:40.297 --> 01:42:42.997
to thick fronds they go ahead and place food on,

01:42:42.997 --> 01:42:43.967
but everyone eventually comes through

01:42:43.967 --> 01:42:46.697
and starts gathering meals, and finding a place to sit.

01:42:46.697 --> 01:42:48.657
Everything looking the direction of this bonfire,

01:42:48.657 --> 01:42:50.797
and there at the very south part of the bonfire,

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:54.839
you can see there are seven stools set up in a semi-circle,

01:42:54.839 --> 01:42:57.907
and three large chairs facing the north side of it,

01:42:57.907 --> 01:43:00.057
their backs to the bonfire.

01:43:00.057 --> 01:43:01.057
You guys are instructed to go ahead

01:43:01.057 --> 01:43:02.887
and gather whatever you wish

01:43:02.887 --> 01:43:05.577
from the veritable smorgasbord of food

01:43:05.577 --> 01:43:08.097
that has been prepared for you,

01:43:08.097 --> 01:43:10.687
with the aid of Caduceus and Beauregard.

01:43:10.687 --> 01:43:12.206
As much as you wanted to aid.

01:43:12.206 --> 01:43:13.127
Mostly Caduceus.

01:43:13.127 --> 01:43:15.407
MARISHA: I, like, threw in some salt. I was that person.

01:43:15.407 --> 01:43:17.411
TALIESIN: You monster! Not that.

01:43:17.411 --> 01:43:18.794
MATT: It needed more salt!

01:43:18.794 --> 01:43:19.987
TALIESIN: It was already, just so much.

01:43:19.987 --> 01:43:20.970
ASHLEY: A little cinnamon?

01:43:20.970 --> 01:43:22.800
TALIESIN: They're using seawater to boil everything!

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.280
(laughter)

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.430
TRAVIS: Yeah, right!

01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:31.122
(laughter)

01:43:31.122 --> 01:43:33.177
Instant puckered lips when we eat.

01:43:33.177 --> 01:43:34.227
TALIESIN: It's why there are no old people.

01:43:34.227 --> 01:43:36.827
They're just all drying up.

01:43:38.382 --> 01:43:40.117
MATT: But eventually you're lead to your seats there

01:43:40.117 --> 01:43:44.147
at the base, that small circle of stools.

01:43:44.147 --> 01:43:46.367
The trio eventually come and sit as well,

01:43:46.367 --> 01:43:50.707
as Lukash, Viridian, and Terra all meet you

01:43:50.707 --> 01:43:54.879
with their perspective meals, sit down and nod.

01:43:55.727 --> 01:43:59.193
Viridian takes the first bit of the conversation.

01:43:59.193 --> 01:44:01.707
"Thank you all for joining us, and it is a pleasure

01:44:01.707 --> 01:44:03.877
"to have you among us for the time that we do.

01:44:05.507 --> 01:44:08.127
"I'm sure you have questions, and we have questions as well.

01:44:08.127 --> 01:44:11.580
"So, as we eat, let us share what we need of each other,

01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:14.447
"and what we hope to learn from each other."

01:44:16.157 --> 01:44:19.710
LAURA: When can we meet Vokodo?

01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:21.547
MATT: "As soon as you need.

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:22.777
"We could leave tomorrow, if you like.

01:44:22.777 --> 01:44:26.944
"I could guide you to the mountain entrance,

01:44:26.944 --> 01:44:28.379
"and introduce you."

01:44:30.728 --> 01:44:34.407
TALIESIN: I think perhaps we should
explore a bit more beforehand

01:44:34.407 --> 01:44:36.499
to get a better sense of the island.

01:44:37.637 --> 01:44:38.767
LIAM: Perhaps we should please

01:44:38.767 --> 01:44:41.277
the caretaker of the island first.

01:44:41.277 --> 01:44:43.557
LAURA: I mean, what if he doesn't want us to have it here,

01:44:43.557 --> 01:44:44.977
and then you know?

01:44:44.977 --> 01:44:46.097
LIAM: Right, we should-

01:44:46.097 --> 01:44:47.537
SAM: Better to know that now.

01:44:47.537 --> 01:44:48.370
LAURA: Exactly.

01:44:48.370 --> 01:44:50.160
SAM: So we can find another island.

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:50.993
LAURA: Yeah.

01:44:52.157 --> 01:44:52.990
SAM: Let's do it!

01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.823
LIAM: So first--
MATT: "Tomorrow, then?"

01:44:53.823 --> 01:44:55.237
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, sure, let's go see him.

01:44:55.237 --> 01:44:56.070
MATT: "All right."

01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:58.967
SAM: Yes, we don't have any-- we should bring a gift.

01:44:59.977 --> 01:45:01.487
LAURA: Sure, yeah.

01:45:01.487 --> 01:45:04.587
Does, like, Vokodo tell you what you need

01:45:04.587 --> 01:45:09.334
when you get there, or are you supposed to just guess?

01:45:10.287 --> 01:45:13.620
MATT: "We gather amongst the village

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:18.620
"crafts and acquired materials, minerals.

01:45:18.937 --> 01:45:22.057
"Anything that we find is of precious origin,

01:45:22.057 --> 01:45:23.257
"whether it be personal,

01:45:23.257 --> 01:45:27.847
"or just a treasure in its own social right,

01:45:27.847 --> 01:45:31.338
"we gather, and I bring it with myself

01:45:31.338 --> 01:45:34.271
to meet with Vokodo,

01:45:34.271 --> 01:45:37.607
"and provide it to him within his lair."

01:45:37.607 --> 01:45:39.897
LAURA: Does he want, like, everything valuable that we have,

01:45:39.897 --> 01:45:43.107
or is it like here's some valuable stuff?
SAM: No, it's just a couple of things!

01:45:43.107 --> 01:45:44.717
MATT: "You carry many valuable things,

01:45:44.717 --> 01:45:47.167
"but that is up to you to give, not me."

01:45:47.167 --> 01:45:48.547
LAURA: Okay.

01:45:48.547 --> 01:45:52.718
SAM: Maybe if we each gave one item, that would be nice.

01:45:52.718 --> 01:45:55.737
Do you think we could do that?

01:45:55.737 --> 01:45:58.237
LAURA: We can look at what we have, sure.

01:45:58.237 --> 01:46:00.187
SAM: What about right now?

01:46:04.657 --> 01:46:05.490
LAURA: I mean.

01:46:06.627 --> 01:46:07.460
You know.

01:46:08.857 --> 01:46:11.837
I don't want to go through my bag, like, right now.

01:46:11.837 --> 01:46:12.670
It seems rude at dinner, you know?
SAM: You don't want to empty out

01:46:12.670 --> 01:46:14.457
your purse on the floor?

01:46:14.457 --> 01:46:15.290
Sure.

01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:17.807
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll just see what
happens when we're there, right?

01:46:19.091 --> 01:46:20.397
It's not like we would need anything extra

01:46:20.397 --> 01:46:22.455
beyond what we have on ourselves.

01:46:23.697 --> 01:46:26.772
LIAM: How often do you bring these tithes to Vokodo?

01:46:28.307 --> 01:46:30.802
MATT: "Well, I generally make a trip

01:46:30.802 --> 01:46:34.947
"to the mountain's interior about once every week or two.

01:46:34.947 --> 01:46:37.787
"I was a few days out from my regular journey,

01:46:37.787 --> 01:46:42.245
"but at your necessary

01:46:42.245 --> 01:46:43.420
"intent to meet,

01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:45.127
"I will move my timeline up a bit.

01:46:45.127 --> 01:46:48.627
"We will gather early in the morning and collect,

01:46:48.627 --> 01:46:50.247
"and then we will be on our way."

01:46:50.247 --> 01:46:53.107
LIAM: Have you ever missed a visit?

01:46:53.107 --> 01:46:58.107
Are there repercussions if you do not bring a gift?

01:46:58.737 --> 01:47:02.827
MATT: "I have not missed a visit
since I've been to the island.

01:47:02.827 --> 01:47:06.267
"Some gifts have been larger than others,

01:47:06.267 --> 01:47:10.383
"and ... as

01:47:10.383 --> 01:47:14.099
"any individual that requires

01:47:14.099 --> 01:47:18.414
"a showing of faith, frustration can be felt.

01:47:18.414 --> 01:47:22.472
"But Vokodo is a

01:47:22.472 --> 01:47:25.138
"kind and understanding god,

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:29.407
"who merely wishes us to improve upon

01:47:29.407 --> 01:47:32.827
"that we may have failed to provide."

01:47:34.147 --> 01:47:38.817
MARISHA: And how is his frustrations manifested?

01:47:40.047 --> 01:47:43.562
MATT: "By lessening the protections
in the village for a time."

01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:47.827
MARISHA: Right.

01:47:49.117 --> 01:47:53.397
So you'll maybe randomly get swarmed by beasts,

01:47:53.397 --> 01:47:55.630
and it's like, "Uh-oh!

01:47:55.630 --> 01:47:57.007
"Vokodo's having a bad week!"

01:47:58.127 --> 01:47:59.452
MATT: "Possibly.

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:05.605
"But I am well versed in bending this surrounding

01:48:06.547 --> 01:48:08.067
"space to my will."

01:48:08.067 --> 01:48:10.819
TALIESIN: Is that possibly what happened to the Ruins?

01:48:12.367 --> 01:48:14.567
MATT: "The Ruins?

01:48:14.567 --> 01:48:16.542
"I know not

01:48:16.542 --> 01:48:20.727
"when the Ruins arrived, or where they once came from,

01:48:20.727 --> 01:48:24.359
"but they don't feel

01:48:26.907 --> 01:48:29.467
"like anything we've constructed in previous generations."

01:48:29.467 --> 01:48:32.104
TRAVIS: Oh my god, we got to the fuck over there!

01:48:32.104 --> 01:48:33.553
LAURA: Oh, I want to see!

01:48:33.553 --> 01:48:34.907
SAM: Should we go there first?

01:48:34.907 --> 01:48:39.887
TALIESIN: I mean, we could just
wait 'til it's the normal trip,

01:48:39.887 --> 01:48:44.445
not ruin the rhythm of what seems to be a

01:48:44.445 --> 01:48:47.561
clockwork system.
TRAVIS: Well, it takes a couple days

01:48:47.561 --> 01:48:48.411
to get over there, right?

01:48:48.411 --> 01:48:49.244
We should check in with

01:48:49.244 --> 01:48:51.352
the front desk, and then explore.
MATT: It does. You have

01:48:51.352 --> 01:48:53.477
eight days from today,

01:48:53.477 --> 01:48:56.254
so roughly a little over seven days until Traveler Con, so--

01:48:56.254 --> 01:48:58.337
TRAVIS: And it takes how many days--?
LAURA: So we can meet with Vokodo,

01:48:58.337 --> 01:49:00.767
keep going north, go to the Ruins!

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:01.600
SAM: Yeah, great!

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.257
LAURA: Let's stop up by Vokodo on the way.

01:49:03.257 --> 01:49:05.077
TRAVIS: That's assuming that anything

01:49:05.077 --> 01:49:07.207
happens after we meet Vokodo.

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:08.277
SAM: It's going to go great!

01:49:08.277 --> 01:49:11.587
We're charming, Jester's a holy person.

01:49:11.587 --> 01:49:13.667
LAURA: Yeah and we have a god on our side.

01:49:13.667 --> 01:49:15.507
SAM: We're going to give great gifts!

01:49:15.507 --> 01:49:18.407
I've got a diamond that I'm willing to part with.

01:49:18.407 --> 01:49:20.317
MATT: You can see, immediately the three of them lean in,

01:49:20.317 --> 01:49:22.347
and they're like, "A diamond?"

01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:25.457
SAM: It's not, you know-- it's just, yeah.

01:49:25.457 --> 01:49:26.290
I have a diamond.

01:49:26.290 --> 01:49:27.367
LAURA: You shouldn't part with your diamond.

01:49:27.367 --> 01:49:28.685
MARISHA: Yeah, you should keep that.

01:49:28.685 --> 01:49:30.937
We're going to need the diamond.
LAURA: We kind of need the diamond.

01:49:30.937 --> 01:49:32.757
MARISHA: We kind of said it out loud.

01:49:32.757 --> 01:49:34.237
MATT: "There are such

01:49:34.237 --> 01:49:37.967
"gems that we bring from within the island itself,

01:49:37.967 --> 01:49:39.807
"and such diamonds are allotted,

01:49:39.807 --> 01:49:44.807
"and sought after by Vokodo, but diamonds from beyond,

01:49:45.817 --> 01:49:48.087
"those in particular, draw his interest.

01:49:48.087 --> 01:49:48.920
"You would be--

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.586
SAM: Great!
MATT: "-- quick to gain his favor."

01:49:50.586 --> 01:49:51.659
I'll give up the diamond!

01:49:51.659 --> 01:49:53.867
LAURA: No, but we need it to bring people-
SAM: It's a 50 gold diamond.

01:49:53.867 --> 01:49:55.410
It can't do anything!

01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:57.942
LAURA: Oh, okay.
MARISHA: Mmm.

01:49:57.942 --> 01:50:00.277
ASHLEY: Do you usually make the trip alone when you go?

01:50:00.277 --> 01:50:01.767
Or do you go in a group?

01:50:01.767 --> 01:50:03.427
MATT: "I do, because it's safest.

01:50:03.427 --> 01:50:06.207
"I have means of traversing independently

01:50:06.207 --> 01:50:11.114
"that are much safer than bringing others with me."

01:50:11.114 --> 01:50:14.155
LAURA: Can you go through the canopies with your vines?

01:50:15.127 --> 01:50:16.847
MATT: "I have other means."

01:50:16.847 --> 01:50:19.977
LAURA: Can you go below the ground, with your vines?

01:50:19.977 --> 01:50:20.810
How do you do it?

01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:21.917
TALIESIN: How did you make that rhyme?

01:50:21.917 --> 01:50:24.187
SAM: We'll see tomorrow.

01:50:24.187 --> 01:50:25.020
MATT: "My...

01:50:27.027 --> 01:50:29.187
"connection with nature allows me

01:50:29.187 --> 01:50:33.537
"the capabilities of calling upon its protection and powers

01:50:33.537 --> 01:50:37.147
"in the vicinity, but I also have learned

01:50:37.147 --> 01:50:40.967
"how to become such creatures that call nature its home."

01:50:40.967 --> 01:50:42.587
ASHLEY: Did you learn that when you came here,

01:50:42.587 --> 01:50:45.177
or were you like that already?

01:50:45.177 --> 01:50:47.107
MATT: "It's just something I always knew how to do."

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.927
(laughter)

01:50:48.927 --> 01:50:51.327
SAM: It's any memory-based question.

01:50:53.077 --> 01:50:55.947
LAURA: Can you go through trees?

01:50:55.947 --> 01:50:58.044
MATT: "I can.

01:51:00.667 --> 01:51:05.244
"Understand, I know the memory lapses are challenging.

01:51:06.227 --> 01:51:09.207
"But those of us of the Vo, we were chosen

01:51:09.207 --> 01:51:11.286
"by Vokodo to come here.

01:51:11.286 --> 01:51:14.017
"These false pasts were stripped away from us,

01:51:14.017 --> 01:51:17.163
"and allowed us to find our true purpose in this island.

01:51:17.163 --> 01:51:22.030
"So as confusing as it may be, and occasionally frustrating,

01:51:23.157 --> 01:51:25.027
"it is for the best."

01:51:25.027 --> 01:51:28.767
TRAVIS: Have you ever seen any precious gemstones or jewels

01:51:28.767 --> 01:51:30.587
that resemble something like this?

01:51:30.587 --> 01:51:33.547
And I'll use Minor Image to conjure an image

01:51:33.547 --> 01:51:37.217
of the Cloven Crystal, the eye.

01:51:37.217 --> 01:51:38.657
MATT: Yeah, they look over it.

01:51:40.217 --> 01:51:44.959
"Not in particular, no, but it is a beautiful example."

01:51:44.959 --> 01:51:46.857
LAURA: Have you ever heard of Uk'otoa?

01:51:46.857 --> 01:51:49.615
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

01:51:51.917 --> 01:51:53.946
MATT: They all think for a moment.

01:51:53.946 --> 01:51:56.196
(laughter)

01:51:58.617 --> 01:51:59.681
TALIESIN: Like showing a horse a cart.

01:51:59.681 --> 01:52:00.807
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:52:00.807 --> 01:52:03.046
LIAM: I don't suppose the Tal'Dorei Council rings a bell?

01:52:03.046 --> 01:52:05.296
(laughter)

01:52:06.347 --> 01:52:10.490
MATT: You notice Viridian goes, "Tal'Dorei..."

01:52:11.567 --> 01:52:12.927
And trails off.

01:52:12.927 --> 01:52:14.952
TRAVIS: In the far distance you hear, "Ah!"

01:52:14.952 --> 01:52:17.437
(laughter)

01:52:17.437 --> 01:52:19.086
TRAVIS: "No!"
MATT: They're running low.

01:52:19.086 --> 01:52:21.336
(laughter)

01:52:22.387 --> 01:52:24.517
SAM: Well then, fine, we'll set out in the morning

01:52:24.517 --> 01:52:26.617
to the volcano,

01:52:27.547 --> 01:52:29.897
and can we just wear this?

01:52:29.897 --> 01:52:31.177
We don't have to, like, dress

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:33.293
in cloaks, or robes, or anything?

01:52:33.293 --> 01:52:34.869
MATT: "No, no, no.

01:52:34.869 --> 01:52:37.182
"Bring yourselves as you are."

01:52:37.182 --> 01:52:38.482
MARISHA: And we shouldn't, like--

01:52:39.777 --> 01:52:42.457
Like these bracers are very expensive and very dope,

01:52:42.457 --> 01:52:45.177
and I'm very attached to them, should I, like, hide them?

01:52:45.177 --> 01:52:47.917
He's not going to see them and be like, "I want that!"

01:52:47.917 --> 01:52:50.457
MATT: Vokodo does not take things from you.

01:52:50.457 --> 01:52:52.452
He accepts what's given.

01:52:52.452 --> 01:52:55.337
MARISHA: 'Kay, but if he sees this,

01:52:55.337 --> 01:52:57.057
and then he sees what I'm giving him,

01:52:57.057 --> 01:52:57.998
is he going to be like,

01:52:57.998 --> 01:53:01.472
"That's a little weak compared
to whatever you got going on here,

01:53:01.472 --> 01:53:03.157
"and I'm going to judge you for that."

01:53:03.157 --> 01:53:04.407
Is he going to be like that?

01:53:05.607 --> 01:53:06.440
MATT: "I don't know,

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:10.074
"I've not encountered such a circumstance before."

01:53:10.074 --> 01:53:12.431
TALIESIN: I'm not too worried about that. I feel like,

01:53:12.431 --> 01:53:14.387
how this works is eventually--

01:53:14.387 --> 01:53:15.907
MARISHA: I love these bracers!

01:53:15.907 --> 01:53:19.110
LAURA: He probably has already seen the bracers, Beau.
TALIESIN: I think the idea is he eventually gets them.

01:53:19.110 --> 01:53:19.943
MARISHA: Huh?

01:53:19.943 --> 01:53:22.647
LAURA: He's probably already seen them.
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a god, hello?

01:53:22.647 --> 01:53:25.667
And do you have gemstones all over your bracers?

01:53:25.667 --> 01:53:28.377
MARISHA: Well, they're very
intricate, and very well-crafted.

01:53:28.377 --> 01:53:29.237
TRAVIS: I don't know about that, but no,

01:53:29.237 --> 01:53:30.607
I don't think he'll be interested.

01:53:30.607 --> 01:53:31.947
TALIESIN: I think they're very well-crafted.

01:53:31.947 --> 01:53:33.887
MARISHA: Thank you.
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

01:53:33.887 --> 01:53:35.118
MARISHA: Okay.

01:53:35.118 --> 01:53:35.977
I was just curious.

01:53:35.977 --> 01:53:37.327
LAURA: What do you want to ask us?

01:53:41.347 --> 01:53:43.437
MATT: "So by what fates have you been brought here?

01:53:43.437 --> 01:53:45.087
"Beyond you've said you were

01:53:46.117 --> 01:53:49.667
"chased by some dragon turtle-type creature.

01:53:51.487 --> 01:53:55.997
"And you come here to hold an event for your god,

01:53:55.997 --> 01:53:58.437
"this Traveler, you say."
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:53:58.437 --> 01:54:00.696
MATT: "What sort of event are you looking for?"

01:54:00.696 --> 01:54:02.709
LAURA: Well, it's like--

01:54:03.912 --> 01:54:06.017
Have you ever heard of, like, a convention?

01:54:06.017 --> 01:54:08.791
SAM: (laughs)

01:54:08.791 --> 01:54:09.757
LAURA: You know, where people

01:54:09.757 --> 01:54:12.277
of similar interests get together,

01:54:12.277 --> 01:54:15.077
and they're like, "Hey, let's talk, let's hang out,

01:54:15.077 --> 01:54:16.627
"let's get to know each other!"

01:54:16.627 --> 01:54:19.037
MATT: "Oh, yeah, that is what Vo is,"

01:54:19.037 --> 01:54:23.067
and Terra's like, "That's fair, yes."
LAURA: Exactly, so basically you're having Vo Con,

01:54:23.067 --> 01:54:25.884
and I want to host Traveler Con!

01:54:26.747 --> 01:54:27.580
TALIESIN: Temporarily.

01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:28.413
MATT: Lukash goes,

01:54:29.707 --> 01:54:32.977
"And how many individuals are you expecting?"

01:54:32.977 --> 01:54:34.917
LAURA: See, that's a really good question,

01:54:34.917 --> 01:54:37.707
because I can't remember.

01:54:37.707 --> 01:54:39.346
I think the island is affecting me.

01:54:39.346 --> 01:54:41.782
(laughter)

01:54:41.782 --> 01:54:42.615
LAURA: But...

01:54:44.937 --> 01:54:46.577
you know,

01:54:46.577 --> 01:54:48.797
I have no clue, honestly.

01:54:48.797 --> 01:54:50.797
SAM: But it's a manageable number.

01:54:50.797 --> 01:54:52.617
LAURA: It's a manageable number, and you know what?

01:54:52.617 --> 01:54:54.547
It's probably even less because

01:54:54.547 --> 01:54:57.707
of all the travel that's involved,

01:54:57.707 --> 01:55:00.757
and the turtle dragon, and all that stuff, so.

01:55:00.757 --> 01:55:02.977
MATT: "Destination convention, challenging to get to.

01:55:02.977 --> 01:55:04.446
"I understand."
LAURA: Exactly, it's like,

01:55:04.446 --> 01:55:08.117
you know, who really wants to be there, or who can make it?

01:55:08.117 --> 01:55:09.657
And then, we'll find out.

01:55:09.657 --> 01:55:12.777
MATT: "Well, unless there are any arguments here,

01:55:12.777 --> 01:55:14.191
"amongst the other two of the council,

01:55:14.191 --> 01:55:15.824
"now that we're all present,

01:55:16.867 --> 01:55:19.507
"once we have the approval of Vokodo,

01:55:19.507 --> 01:55:21.427
"I do not see why we wouldn't be able to aid you

01:55:21.427 --> 01:55:26.427
"and accept these travelers of the Traveler, if you will--"

01:55:26.517 --> 01:55:27.350
LAURA: Yeah.

01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:28.390
MATT: "-- into Vo itself, to celebrate."

01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:30.417
LAURA: Everybody that worships the Traveler is

01:55:30.417 --> 01:55:35.067
super helpful, they really just want to come in,

01:55:35.067 --> 01:55:36.487
and not cause any trouble,

01:55:36.487 --> 01:55:38.507
and just help as much as possible.

01:55:38.507 --> 01:55:39.666
MATT: Roll a deception check.

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:41.916
(laughter)

01:55:43.167 --> 01:55:44.642
TRAVIS: Just had to fucking pour it on!

01:55:44.642 --> 01:55:47.867
(laughter)

01:55:47.867 --> 01:55:48.977
LAURA: Nine!

01:55:48.977 --> 01:55:50.793
MARISHA and TALIESIN: <i>Nein</i>!

01:55:52.974 --> 01:55:55.177
MATT: You can see Lukash nods,

01:55:55.177 --> 01:55:58.207
Terra, sitting there, arms crossed, is like--

01:55:58.207 --> 01:55:59.727
TALIESIN: At the very least, we're very helpful,

01:55:59.727 --> 01:56:01.657
and are always happy to help clean up.

01:56:01.657 --> 01:56:03.320
MATT: Viridian's looking at you with a--

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:05.112
TRAVIS: At the very least.

01:56:06.307 --> 01:56:07.423
MATT: "Interesting.

01:56:08.687 --> 01:56:12.607
"Well, in the event that Vokodo

01:56:12.607 --> 01:56:16.077
"does not see such a union as fit, do not take offense.

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:18.467
"I'm sure there are other places

01:56:18.467 --> 01:56:20.267
"of which to hold such an event."

01:56:20.267 --> 01:56:23.292
LAURA: Sure, like Heaven Falls.

01:56:23.292 --> 01:56:24.617
Or the Ruins?

01:56:28.127 --> 01:56:30.307
MATT: "I cannot vouch for those as being safe locations

01:56:30.307 --> 01:56:32.747
"for such an event.

01:56:36.257 --> 01:56:38.967
"Heaven Falls protects

01:56:39.857 --> 01:56:44.440
"the ocean entrance to the interior of

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.581
"Vokodo's lair."

01:56:45.581 --> 01:56:47.697
ALL: (gasping)
MARISHA: Oh!

01:56:47.697 --> 01:56:52.697
MATT: "And is not meant to be passed by any mortal soul."

01:56:52.937 --> 01:56:53.770
MARISHA: Oh!

01:56:55.273 --> 01:56:56.877
TALIESIN: So Heaven Falls is like,

01:56:58.456 --> 01:57:01.229
a water passage into the center of the volcano?

01:57:01.229 --> 01:57:04.097
LAURA: Oh, or is it, like, a molten lava passage?

01:57:04.097 --> 01:57:04.947
TALIESIN: Or a waterfall?

01:57:06.141 --> 01:57:07.502
MATT: You watch as

01:57:09.517 --> 01:57:11.037
she twirls her finger,

01:57:11.037 --> 01:57:13.177
and Viridian mutters beneath her breath,

01:57:13.177 --> 01:57:18.177
and you see in the dirt, these small flower stems

01:57:18.177 --> 01:57:21.007
begin to grow together to form this mountain.

01:57:21.007 --> 01:57:23.857
Like a small version of Rumblecusp.

01:57:23.857 --> 01:57:24.690
TALIESIN: That's cool.

01:57:24.690 --> 01:57:26.247
MATT: Then as she spins her finger again,

01:57:26.247 --> 01:57:27.997
this wind begins to blow around it

01:57:27.997 --> 01:57:30.697
to create this pattern that looks like a little water

01:57:30.697 --> 01:57:32.517
around the island.

01:57:32.517 --> 01:57:37.467
She goes, "On the side of the island

01:57:37.467 --> 01:57:41.170
"where the inlet makes its way to the rock's heart,"

01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:42.827
and as she brings her finger upward,

01:57:42.827 --> 01:57:47.817
you can see the sand begins to flow upward, up the mountain.

01:57:47.817 --> 01:57:52.245
"That is where the waterfall lies, not down, but up.

01:57:53.367 --> 01:57:55.167
"The water cascades toward the sky,

01:57:55.167 --> 01:57:57.030
"before curling into the mountain itself."

01:57:57.030 --> 01:58:00.264
LAURA: What!
ASHLEY: That's so cool.

01:58:00.264 --> 01:58:02.417
MARISHA: So that's why it's Heaven Falls.
TALIESIN: I feel like I need to see that.

01:58:02.417 --> 01:58:03.757
SAM: But we're not allowed to go there?

01:58:03.757 --> 01:58:05.327
LAURA: Because I really want to see that!

01:58:05.327 --> 01:58:06.837
MATT: "You are welcome to go see it,

01:58:06.837 --> 01:58:08.477
"but to traverse the falls is forbidden."

01:58:08.477 --> 01:58:09.310
SAM: Oh.

01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:11.001
LAURA: What if this place really--

01:58:12.487 --> 01:58:15.027
(quieter) what if this place
really is the center of the world?

01:58:15.027 --> 01:58:15.860
SAM: It could be.

01:58:16.937 --> 01:58:18.917
LAURA: I mean, I believe you, obviously,

01:58:18.917 --> 01:58:20.867
but what if it really is?

01:58:20.867 --> 01:58:22.987
TRAVIS: That's on the northwestern side of the island?

01:58:22.987 --> 01:58:23.837
MATT: Northeastern side.

01:58:23.837 --> 01:58:25.708
TRAVIS: Northeastern side.
SAM: We could just stay.

01:58:25.708 --> 01:58:27.730
MATT: I believe I said that, yeah.
ASHLEY: We could.

01:58:27.730 --> 01:58:30.225
TRAVIS: You did say that, I just wrote it down wrong.

01:58:31.617 --> 01:58:34.777
MATT: "The Ruin I cannot vouch for, we don't go there.

01:58:35.937 --> 01:58:38.467
"The northern side of the island is

01:58:41.197 --> 01:58:42.302
"mostly...

01:58:44.837 --> 01:58:46.217
"untraveled.

01:58:46.217 --> 01:58:47.617
"Dangerous.

01:58:47.617 --> 01:58:50.197
"The scattering of worlds--"
TALIESIN: Ghosts?

01:58:50.197 --> 01:58:51.567
MATT: "-- that create this island,

01:58:53.117 --> 01:58:55.913
"tend to be a bit more volatile.

01:58:55.913 --> 01:58:58.267
TALIESIN: Would you say it's haunted, these ruins?

01:58:58.267 --> 01:59:00.170
Ghosts, spirits-
TRAVIS: Are they inhabited?

01:59:00.170 --> 01:59:02.017
MATT: "Oh, there are spirits throughout the island.

01:59:02.017 --> 01:59:03.557
TALIESIN: Oh, right.
MATT: "But up there is all manner

01:59:03.557 --> 01:59:07.343
"of strange, other beasts."

01:59:07.343 --> 01:59:09.017
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, we got to go, man!

01:59:09.017 --> 01:59:10.367
LIAM: Must go, must go to Ruins.
MARISHA: Yeah, we got to go.

01:59:10.367 --> 01:59:11.607
TRAVIS: Damn it!

01:59:11.607 --> 01:59:14.417
TALIESIN: Any dangerous plants to look out for?

01:59:14.417 --> 01:59:16.550
MATT: "Numerous, but I'll be guiding you guys,

01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:18.627
"to the mountain, so I'll be able to warn you

01:59:18.627 --> 01:59:22.009
"of any sort of known dangers ahead."

01:59:22.009 --> 01:59:23.883
MARISHA: Speaking of ghosts--

01:59:23.883 --> 01:59:26.308
TRAVIS: Nope, nope.
MARISHA: What do you all do with your dead?

01:59:27.507 --> 01:59:30.467
MATT: "When--" and there's a solemn moment

01:59:30.467 --> 01:59:32.127
where they all look at each other.

01:59:33.217 --> 01:59:34.857
"Those that are lost to us,

01:59:34.857 --> 01:59:39.567
"are given rites under Vokodo himself,

01:59:39.567 --> 01:59:42.517
"and much like the flames that give birth

01:59:42.517 --> 01:59:45.147
"to fertile land and to allow new forest

01:59:45.147 --> 01:59:47.234
"to grow upon those that are old,

01:59:47.234 --> 01:59:51.793
"they are interred to ash, as the god would've decreed."

01:59:54.834 --> 01:59:56.407
MARISHA: Okay, standard.

01:59:56.407 --> 01:59:57.567
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:59:57.567 --> 01:59:58.542
TALIESIN: Nothing weird about that.

01:59:58.542 --> 01:59:59.942
MARISHA: No, it's fine.

02:00:01.767 --> 02:00:03.877
LAURA: You know what would be weird?

02:00:03.877 --> 02:00:05.297
Is if they put them in the ground,

02:00:05.297 --> 02:00:06.727
and then they made tea out of them,

02:00:06.727 --> 02:00:10.807
that would be so fucking weird! (chortling)

02:00:10.807 --> 02:00:12.797
(laughter)

02:00:12.797 --> 02:00:14.387
TALIESIN: There's nothing weird about that.

02:00:14.387 --> 02:00:16.267
MATT: "It's a little strange."

02:00:16.267 --> 02:00:18.062
MARISHA: Do you want some? He's got dead people tea.

02:00:18.062 --> 02:00:19.517
TALIESIN: I do.

02:00:19.517 --> 02:00:20.597
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:00:20.597 --> 02:00:23.067
ASHLEY: I quite enjoy it.
MATT: "I'm okay, thank you."

02:00:23.067 --> 02:00:25.682
Lukash is like, "Actually I'll try some if you make it."

02:00:25.682 --> 02:00:26.977
TALIESIN: [inaudible]

02:00:26.977 --> 02:00:28.017
TRAVIS: The adventurous sniff.

02:00:28.017 --> 02:00:29.007
MATT: Terra goes, "Lukash!"

02:00:29.007 --> 02:00:30.837
He's like, "What, I'm curious!"

02:00:30.837 --> 02:00:33.424
TALIESIN: It's got a little kick, this is good.

02:00:36.387 --> 02:00:37.602
It'll wake you up.

02:00:37.602 --> 02:00:39.737
MATT: "Ah."
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:00:39.737 --> 02:00:40.908
MATT: "There's the dead person."

02:00:40.908 --> 02:00:42.787
(laughter)

02:00:42.787 --> 02:00:45.727
"It's more of a trailing aftertaste, interesting."

02:00:45.727 --> 02:00:47.415
TALIESIN: He had a lot to say.

02:00:47.415 --> 02:00:49.517
(laughter)

02:00:49.517 --> 02:00:51.917
MATT: The meal is delicious.

02:00:51.917 --> 02:00:54.747
Especially given the somewhat,

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:59.057
seemingly basic lifestyle that is kept here,

02:00:59.057 --> 02:01:02.259
it is vibrant in its flavors.

02:01:02.259 --> 02:01:03.707
Are there any other elements of the conversation

02:01:03.707 --> 02:01:05.427
you want to ask about or inquire?

02:01:05.427 --> 02:01:10.227
TRAVIS: How does the feeling that we're being watched feel?

02:01:10.227 --> 02:01:11.877
Worse, less?

02:01:11.877 --> 02:01:13.367
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,

02:01:13.367 --> 02:01:15.967
and you take a moment to think to that thought,

02:01:15.967 --> 02:01:18.751
you feel the hairs on the back of your neck

02:01:18.751 --> 02:01:20.357
stand up a little bit.

02:01:20.357 --> 02:01:24.107
And you can't help yourself but

02:01:24.107 --> 02:01:24.997
look over your shoulder,

02:01:24.997 --> 02:01:27.087
back towards the side of the bonfire.

02:01:27.087 --> 02:01:29.243
There's nothing there.

02:01:29.243 --> 02:01:30.657
But it hasn't lessened.

02:01:30.657 --> 02:01:32.927
TRAVIS: I don't like-- I don't like this!

02:01:32.927 --> 02:01:34.007
SAM: It's great!

02:01:34.007 --> 02:01:35.357
TALIESIN: I'm running Eyes of the Grave again.

02:01:35.357 --> 02:01:36.577
MATT: Okay.

02:01:37.527 --> 02:01:39.247
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll do the Divine Sense as well,

02:01:39.247 --> 02:01:40.487
same time, same time!

02:01:40.487 --> 02:01:42.413
MATT: Okay, Divine Sense.

02:01:42.413 --> 02:01:46.497
Both of you focus that same creeping,

02:01:46.497 --> 02:01:51.497
sourceless presence, somewhere, somewhere!

02:01:51.717 --> 02:01:55.657
But neither of your extended sense

02:01:57.267 --> 02:01:58.527
are able to grasp anything.

02:01:58.527 --> 02:02:02.667
LIAM: Does Caleb have the same sense as well?

02:02:02.667 --> 02:02:03.607
MATT: Does which one?

02:02:03.607 --> 02:02:06.967
LIAM: Does Caleb feel the exact same thing the others do?

02:02:06.967 --> 02:02:07.827
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Okay.

02:02:07.827 --> 02:02:08.660
MARISHA: We all do.

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.847
MATT: You all do, like, everyone of you individually.

02:02:10.847 --> 02:02:12.567
You haven't really discussed it out loud,

02:02:12.567 --> 02:02:15.759
but all of you have this weird

02:02:16.647 --> 02:02:19.629
presence that you can't shake.

02:02:19.629 --> 02:02:21.290
TRAVIS: Do you guys feel like something's watching you?

02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:22.123
MARISHA: Yeah, totally!

02:02:22.123 --> 02:02:23.820
TALIESIN: I feel like this is conversation

02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.089
for when we're in the bubble.

02:02:25.089 --> 02:02:28.317
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my sketchbook,

02:02:28.317 --> 02:02:29.947
and I'm going to write on the page,

02:02:31.117 --> 02:02:33.842
"Who the hell is watching us??"

02:02:33.842 --> 02:02:37.117
Question mark, question mark,
trying to talk to the Traveler.

02:02:37.117 --> 02:02:37.950
MATT: Gotcha.

02:02:39.217 --> 02:02:41.887
LIAM: Also Caleb does not eat any of the food,

02:02:41.887 --> 02:02:44.107
I slip one of the Beads of Nourishment to myself

02:02:44.107 --> 02:02:46.587
at some point, and pretend to drink a few times.

02:02:46.587 --> 02:02:48.087
MATT: You got it, okay.

02:02:48.087 --> 02:02:50.737
LAURA: I tried to do that, but then as I smelled the food,

02:02:50.737 --> 02:02:52.684
I gave in, and ate the food.

02:02:52.684 --> 02:02:54.860
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:57.917
It is very tasty!
LIAM: True to life.

02:02:57.917 --> 02:02:59.328
TRAVIS: I just want to go to sleep, we've got tomorrow.

02:02:59.328 --> 02:03:02.757
SAM: Yeah, we want to get it going in the morning, early.

02:03:02.757 --> 02:03:05.477
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out my harp and play

02:03:05.477 --> 02:03:07.647
for a little bit, by the fire.

02:03:07.647 --> 02:03:10.987
LAURA: Oh! As soon as I see her pull out the harp,

02:03:10.987 --> 02:03:12.064
I'm going to cast--

02:03:12.064 --> 02:03:14.867
I'm going to go up and put my hand on her shoulder and say:

02:03:14.867 --> 02:03:16.888
I can't wait to hear this.

02:03:16.888 --> 02:03:19.063
ASHLEY: I've been practicing, so I think--

02:03:19.063 --> 02:03:20.670
LAURA: Yeah!
ASHLEY: Hopefully it will sound okay.

02:03:20.670 --> 02:03:23.207
But, you know, have dessert, and have some tea,

02:03:23.207 --> 02:03:25.101
and talk and stuff.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:03:25.101 --> 02:03:27.977
And then I cast Enhance Abilities on you.

02:03:27.977 --> 02:03:28.810
ASHLEY: Say again?
LAURA: I'm not going to

02:03:28.810 --> 02:03:30.855
tell her I'm casting Enhance Abilities.

02:03:30.855 --> 02:03:35.530
But I'm going to cast Enhance Abilities for charisma.
ASHLEY: Oh! Oh!

02:03:35.530 --> 02:03:36.527
MATT: Okay.

02:03:36.527 --> 02:03:38.797
SAM: And as a thank you for this lovely meal,

02:03:38.797 --> 02:03:42.764
we'd like to introduce Yasha to perform--
ASHLEY: Wait Doesn't--!

02:03:42.764 --> 02:03:46.065
SAM: -- a lovely after-meal song.
MARISHA: (snapping fingers) Woo!

02:03:46.065 --> 02:03:48.077
Yeah! Get it!
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:03:48.077 --> 02:03:50.077
MATT: Applause begins to climb, as everyone around there,

02:03:50.077 --> 02:03:52.797
and now the full village in presence here.

02:03:52.797 --> 02:03:54.247
MATT: Which mostly people come to sit

02:03:54.247 --> 02:03:55.849
since you had come down beforehand,

02:03:55.849 --> 02:03:58.407
you look around you, and there is close to 100 people,

02:03:58.407 --> 02:04:01.127
all sitting, and all looking directly in your direction.

02:04:01.127 --> 02:04:03.335
And they all just start clapping, it becomes this--

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:05.907
ASHLEY: (harp glissando)
MATT: -- this rousing applause,

02:04:05.907 --> 02:04:08.400
all focused on you.

02:04:09.827 --> 02:04:12.059
ASHLEY: Oh, well.

02:04:12.059 --> 02:04:13.263
TRAVIS: Woo!

02:04:13.263 --> 02:04:15.777
ASHLEY: I'm still learning.

02:04:15.777 --> 02:04:16.610
But,

02:04:18.803 --> 02:04:19.817
here we go.
MARISHA: Free Bird!

02:04:21.483 --> 02:04:23.097
ASHLEY: I start playing.

02:04:23.097 --> 02:04:24.368
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Something.

02:04:24.368 --> 02:04:27.155
MATT: Go ahead and make a performance check
for me with advantage.

02:04:27.155 --> 02:04:28.047
ASHLEY: With advantage, okay.

02:04:28.047 --> 02:04:29.410
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

02:04:31.257 --> 02:04:33.897
LIAM: Caleb casts Major Image, and silent lightning

02:04:33.897 --> 02:04:36.657
starts to go (flickering)

02:04:36.657 --> 02:04:37.957
behind her.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

02:04:40.047 --> 02:04:41.434
ASHLEY: What's Enhance Ability do?
LAURA: It gives you advantage.

02:04:41.434 --> 02:04:42.857
MATT: It gives you an advantage on that, yeah.

02:04:42.857 --> 02:04:44.047
ASHLEY: Okay, got it.

02:04:44.047 --> 02:04:49.047
Okay, so that would be, performance, I get a minus two.

02:04:49.407 --> 02:04:50.311
17.
ASHLEY: Hey!

02:04:50.311 --> 02:04:52.187
MARISHA: That's pretty good!

02:04:52.187 --> 02:04:53.277
ASHLEY: Not bad.

02:04:53.277 --> 02:04:54.827
MATT: So as you

02:04:54.827 --> 02:04:57.437
begin to pluck, the first couple

02:04:57.437 --> 02:05:00.487
come off at a strange discordant row,

02:05:00.487 --> 02:05:01.320
and you shake your head

02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:04.027
a bit in frustration and concentrate.

02:05:04.027 --> 02:05:05.287
Take a deep breath,

02:05:05.287 --> 02:05:06.687
and then continue once more.

02:05:08.538 --> 02:05:10.138
ASHLEY: I want to play something sort of

02:05:12.667 --> 02:05:14.578
a little sad,

02:05:14.578 --> 02:05:17.827
but also just beautiful and light,

02:05:17.827 --> 02:05:19.137
and a nice after dinner--

02:05:20.894 --> 02:05:23.427
just something nice and light.

02:05:23.427 --> 02:05:24.627
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: But a little sad.

02:05:24.627 --> 02:05:27.257
MATT: Yeah, it's not terribly intricate.

02:05:27.257 --> 02:05:28.987
But it is still beautiful.

02:05:28.987 --> 02:05:29.820
Haunting,

02:05:31.087 --> 02:05:32.737
but

02:05:32.737 --> 02:05:34.347
beautiful.

02:05:34.347 --> 02:05:37.357
As the song begins to flow through,

02:05:38.417 --> 02:05:42.317
everyone's mood begins to shift, it falls quiet.

02:05:42.317 --> 02:05:44.207
You can't even hear a single person breathe,

02:05:44.207 --> 02:05:46.177
as everyone's leaning forward.

02:05:46.177 --> 02:05:48.617
Yasha, as she begins to get into

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:53.247
the sense of the song, storytelling though the harp itself,

02:05:53.247 --> 02:05:54.887
her eyes begin to close.

02:05:54.887 --> 02:05:56.949
And that's when the silent lightning begins to

02:05:56.949 --> 02:05:58.817
(cracking) arc behind her,

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:01.657
causing these little flashes of blue

02:06:01.657 --> 02:06:04.247
back lighting across her shoulders, and her hair,

02:06:04.247 --> 02:06:05.767
and the sides of the harp.

02:06:06.707 --> 02:06:10.497
You watch as the flames of the bonfire

02:06:10.497 --> 02:06:13.387
seem to die down slightly,

02:06:13.387 --> 02:06:17.037
as you watch Viridian.
TALIESIN: I'm bring them down.

02:06:17.037 --> 02:06:19.811
MATT: Yeah, Viridian's doing the same, actually, as well.

02:06:19.811 --> 02:06:20.644
(laughter)

02:06:20.644 --> 02:06:23.837
The bonfire flames begin to fade a bit,

02:06:23.837 --> 02:06:28.837
as now the central focus is Yasha's performance.

02:06:29.267 --> 02:06:32.657
With each pluck resonating and echoing,

02:06:32.657 --> 02:06:35.047
and growing louder, the movements become more fluid,

02:06:35.047 --> 02:06:39.687
and for a woman who is so

02:06:39.687 --> 02:06:41.787
known amongst you for the

02:06:42.668 --> 02:06:45.057
volumetric rage

02:06:45.057 --> 02:06:47.637
and forceful brutality,

02:06:47.637 --> 02:06:50.353
there is

02:06:50.353 --> 02:06:53.494
an unexpected grace to the movements.

02:06:53.494 --> 02:06:55.717
The gentle shifting of the wrist,

02:06:55.717 --> 02:07:00.389
the swaying with each progressive pull.

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:02.951
And as the eyes are still closed,

02:07:02.951 --> 02:07:04.751
and the lightning is still flashing,

02:07:09.907 --> 02:07:13.097
you see Yasha in a vulnerable light

02:07:13.097 --> 02:07:16.797
you've not really seen before.

02:07:19.507 --> 02:07:20.467
In a healing light.

02:07:23.807 --> 02:07:25.577
And as the song comes to a close,

02:07:27.787 --> 02:07:28.797
and the

02:07:31.407 --> 02:07:33.347
what some people would call the spirit that takes over,

02:07:33.347 --> 02:07:35.107
whatever it is, that muse within you

02:07:35.107 --> 02:07:37.657
that brought this song through in this moment,

02:07:37.657 --> 02:07:41.217
this very briefly stressful moment,

02:07:42.907 --> 02:07:44.357
you can't believe you did that.

02:07:46.707 --> 02:07:47.857
As the lightning fades,

02:07:49.153 --> 02:07:53.640
(applause)

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:57.397
ASHLEY: I put it in my bag, and I walk straight to the tree.

02:07:57.397 --> 02:07:59.494
MATT: And Yasha just runs away from it!

02:07:59.494 --> 02:08:01.744
(laughter)

02:08:04.847 --> 02:08:06.138
(as Viridian) "Your friend is very talented."

02:08:06.138 --> 02:08:07.594
LAURA: Yes, she is.

02:08:07.594 --> 02:08:08.427
TRAVIS: She is!

02:08:08.427 --> 02:08:10.518
TALIESIN: Mm.

02:08:10.518 --> 02:08:12.317
MARISHA: Yeah, we knew that.

02:08:12.317 --> 02:08:15.377
I mean, we've seen that like 100 times

02:08:16.307 --> 02:08:17.140
by now.

02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:20.947
MATT: "Well, it is a joyous change of pace.

02:08:21.917 --> 02:08:25.217
"Music is not something we get too often on this island."

02:08:26.137 --> 02:08:28.767
TRAVIS: Why not, no musicians amongst you?

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:30.234
MATT: "We do, but they're terrible."

02:08:30.234 --> 02:08:32.484
(laughter)

02:08:34.247 --> 02:08:36.617
TRAVIS: We're glad to brighten your evening.

02:08:36.617 --> 02:08:37.872
MATT: "Very much so."

02:08:37.872 --> 02:08:41.577
Lukash goes, "Well, I'm closing out for the evening.

02:08:41.577 --> 02:08:43.827
I'm a bit full, and I'm getting the sleepies.

02:08:45.477 --> 02:08:46.667
"Have a good night, folks,"

02:08:46.667 --> 02:08:48.457
and he stands up, and makes his way off.

02:08:48.457 --> 02:08:50.327
And Terra quietly just stands, not a word,

02:08:50.327 --> 02:08:52.897
and just gives a nod, and leaves.

02:08:52.897 --> 02:08:55.437
Viridian says, "Make sure to get some rest,

02:08:55.437 --> 02:08:58.082
"we have quite a trek tomorrow,

02:08:59.087 --> 02:09:04.009
"and not the safest one, either, so be at your best."

02:09:05.077 --> 02:09:06.577
SAM: See you in the morning!

02:09:06.577 --> 02:09:07.410
MATT: "Until then."

02:09:07.410 --> 02:09:08.707
LAURA: What time are we leaving?

02:09:09.717 --> 02:09:12.767
MATT: "Well, if you can, shortly after sunrise,

02:09:12.767 --> 02:09:13.767
"would be preferable."

02:09:14.788 --> 02:09:16.837
LAURA: Tight, tight tight tight.

02:09:16.837 --> 02:09:18.172
TRAVIS: Certainly.
SAM: Ugh!

02:09:18.172 --> 02:09:20.287
MATT: "I'll see you then," and Viridian stands up

02:09:20.287 --> 02:09:22.265
and makes her way off.

02:09:23.847 --> 02:09:25.207
The crowd's now starting to disperse a bit,

02:09:25.207 --> 02:09:27.577
people are starting to leave to their abodes

02:09:27.577 --> 02:09:29.647
here in the village of Vo.

02:09:29.647 --> 02:09:30.747
LAURA: Yasha played really good!

02:09:30.747 --> 02:09:32.237
TALIESIN: That was, that was--

02:09:32.237 --> 02:09:35.154
MARISHA: That was amazing.
MATT: Yasha's still gone, by the way.

02:09:36.127 --> 02:09:38.447
TALIESIN: Let's get somewhere safe.

02:09:38.447 --> 02:09:42.327
SAM: Well, are we going to stay in the Doron's house?

02:09:42.327 --> 02:09:43.467
TALIESIN: But I'd say--

02:09:43.467 --> 02:09:44.562
SAM: Put the bubble around it?

02:09:44.562 --> 02:09:47.344
TALIESIN: I want to talk, if that's all right.
SAM: Is that possible?

02:09:47.344 --> 02:09:48.544
LAURA: Yeah.

02:09:48.544 --> 02:09:52.857
MATT: Okay, so you guys all head
back to the hollowed out tree?

02:09:52.857 --> 02:09:55.337
LIAM: Yeah, I will throw up the dome inside of it,

02:09:55.337 --> 02:09:58.067
the same color as the tree wood around it,

02:09:58.067 --> 02:10:00.027
and I will have Frumpkin sit up high

02:10:00.027 --> 02:10:01.454
and stay awake the entire night and watch.

02:10:01.454 --> 02:10:02.287
MATT: Okay, everyone's heading back?

02:10:02.287 --> 02:10:04.140
Anyone want to look for Yasha?
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Yasha,

02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:05.347
because I don't know where she went.

02:10:05.347 --> 02:10:06.537
MATT: Okay.

02:10:06.537 --> 02:10:07.797
LAURA: Yasha!

02:10:07.797 --> 02:10:09.640
You played so good!

02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.497
We're all heading back to the tree house!

02:10:12.497 --> 02:10:14.808
Come back!

02:10:14.808 --> 02:10:15.815
You pooping?

02:10:15.815 --> 02:10:17.317
(laughter)

02:10:17.317 --> 02:10:19.128
MARISHA: ♪ Yasha come back! ♪

02:10:19.128 --> 02:10:21.576
ASHLEY: I'm already, here in the tree house.

02:10:21.576 --> 02:10:22.722
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: Oh!

02:10:22.722 --> 02:10:26.208
Well, I didn't need to waste the fucking spell.
ASHLEY: I'll you guys in just a moment.

02:10:26.208 --> 02:10:27.528
MATT: You hear that just as you're opening the door,

02:10:27.528 --> 02:10:28.587
(creaking) she's, like, right there

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:29.747
talking to you, it's that weird moment

02:10:29.747 --> 02:10:30.580
when you're both on the phone,

02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:33.004
but you both went to the same room, there's that.

02:10:33.004 --> 02:10:33.837
TRAVIS: Weird reverb.

02:10:33.837 --> 02:10:35.987
TALIESIN: We're hearing it, and like, the delay.

02:10:35.987 --> 02:10:37.407
ASHLEY: I'm, like, in my head and then also--

02:10:37.407 --> 02:10:38.840
LAURA: It's so weird! Random!

02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:40.795
ASHLEY: Coming towards the door and opening it.
LAURA: I've never done that before!

02:10:40.795 --> 02:10:42.237
I've never done that before!
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was cool.

02:10:42.237 --> 02:10:45.177
TALIESIN: Hard to get a ley line
out here, it's all very, yeah.

02:10:45.177 --> 02:10:46.157
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: It's too real.

02:10:46.157 --> 02:10:46.990
LAURA: Stupid!

02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:50.348
(laughter)

02:10:51.437 --> 02:10:52.327
SAM: So we're safe!

02:10:52.327 --> 02:10:53.857
TALIESIN: Well.

02:10:53.857 --> 02:10:55.807
SAM: Yeah, he's made the dome.
MATT: The door's closed.

02:10:55.807 --> 02:10:57.857
So you complete the ritual to form the dome,

02:10:57.857 --> 02:11:00.467
which (whooshing) encompasses the majority

02:11:00.467 --> 02:11:01.617
of the interior of the floor here.

02:11:01.617 --> 02:11:02.847
The tree is pretty thick,

02:11:02.847 --> 02:11:05.627
you only have maybe about a 15,

02:11:05.627 --> 02:11:08.711
you know, a little over 15-foot diameter

02:11:08.711 --> 02:11:12.867
in this interior space, so the dome fills most of it.

02:11:12.867 --> 02:11:15.447
TRAVIS: You have a diamond that
you're going to offer tomorrow?

02:11:15.447 --> 02:11:17.107
SAM: It's just a small diamond, it's like a stud.

02:11:17.107 --> 02:11:18.477
Just a little stud.
LAURA: It's a dinky diamond.

02:11:18.477 --> 02:11:19.777
SAM: It's a 50 gold diamond.

02:11:19.777 --> 02:11:22.147
TRAVIS: We have, like, platinum and gold, and stuff.

02:11:22.147 --> 02:11:23.777
LAURA: I don't want to give him platinum!

02:11:23.777 --> 02:11:26.117
I don't care about this stupid god, anyway.

02:11:26.117 --> 02:11:28.977
SAM: Well, yeah, but we got to give him something

02:11:28.977 --> 02:11:32.307
worthy enough to get permission for your convention.

02:11:32.307 --> 02:11:33.817
I mean, don't you want that?

02:11:33.817 --> 02:11:36.377
LAURA: Well yeah, but like, I'm just going to like--

02:11:36.377 --> 02:11:38.827
the Traveler's going to come, he's going to talk to Avocado,

02:11:38.827 --> 02:11:42.757
and then he's going to be like, "Hey man.

02:11:42.757 --> 02:11:44.009
I'm a god, you're a god--"

02:11:44.009 --> 02:11:46.137
SAM: Yeah, but shouldn't we get on the right foot?

02:11:46.137 --> 02:11:48.187
I feel like if we just give a little bit

02:11:48.187 --> 02:11:51.527
of something nice up front, it could go a long way.

02:11:51.527 --> 02:11:54.147
LAURA: What if Avocado really is a god, though?

02:11:54.147 --> 02:11:56.817
And the Traveler's like, "Ew."

02:11:56.817 --> 02:11:57.650
TALIESIN: I don't--

02:11:57.650 --> 02:12:00.490
TRAVIS: Well, if he is a god, I don't know that he or they

02:12:00.490 --> 02:12:03.487
would appreciate you calling them Avocado.

02:12:03.487 --> 02:12:05.797
But maybe we should just, you know,

02:12:05.797 --> 02:12:09.030
be a good representative for the Traveler,

02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:12.616
and then let the Traveler do his, you know, thing.

02:12:12.616 --> 02:12:14.340
LAURA: You want to be a good representative

02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:16.269
for the Traveler, Fjord?

02:12:17.867 --> 02:12:18.937
TRAVIS: Do I?

02:12:18.937 --> 02:12:20.309
LAURA: Yeah, is that what you want?

02:12:20.309 --> 02:12:23.987
TRAVIS: Is that what you want us to be?

02:12:23.987 --> 02:12:26.707
TALIESIN: An ambassador, one would say.
ASHLEY: And also if, you know,

02:12:28.057 --> 02:12:30.187
Avocado is a real god,

02:12:30.187 --> 02:12:32.297
then maybe,

02:12:32.297 --> 02:12:35.877
he won't be threatened by the Traveler, you know?

02:12:35.877 --> 02:12:37.727
Because-
MARISHA: He shouldn't be, right?

02:12:37.727 --> 02:12:38.560
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:42.327
LAURA: Well, he should be, because the Traveler is still

02:12:42.327 --> 02:12:45.723
pretty amazing, and very powerful, so.

02:12:45.723 --> 02:12:48.981
MARISHA: Well, but you hope someone is, like, secure

02:12:48.981 --> 02:12:51.217
in themselves for our benefit, right?

02:12:51.217 --> 02:12:53.545
TALIESIN: Well, you know.
LAURA: I mean. (stammering)

02:12:53.545 --> 02:12:54.553
MARISHA: Do we want a god fight?

02:12:54.553 --> 02:12:55.624
We don't want a god fight.
LAURA: Hey, Yasha!

02:12:55.624 --> 02:12:57.573
TALIESIN: More of a cult fight.
TRAVIS: Only one of them is a god, right?

02:12:57.573 --> 02:12:59.136
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Maybe.

02:12:59.136 --> 02:13:01.781
LAURA: Well, (stammering) no!

02:13:01.781 --> 02:13:04.655
(stammering) What if?

02:13:04.655 --> 02:13:06.269
MARISHA: What if they're both not real gods,

02:13:06.269 --> 02:13:09.033
then they're definitely going to fight, ah man!

02:13:09.033 --> 02:13:10.107
LAURA: What if they just get along?

02:13:10.107 --> 02:13:11.843
What if they're like, "Hey man!"

02:13:11.843 --> 02:13:13.567
LIAM: Yeah, we are putting the cart before the horse.

02:13:13.567 --> 02:13:14.707
ASHLEY: True.
LIAM: We'll just figure out

02:13:14.707 --> 02:13:16.727
what we are dealing with before we even

02:13:16.727 --> 02:13:19.437
bring the Traveler into it.

02:13:19.437 --> 02:13:20.927
LAURA: Why don't you guys ask the Wild Mother

02:13:20.927 --> 02:13:23.227
how she feels about the Traveler?

02:13:24.967 --> 02:13:27.137
TALIESIN: I mean, I can't do it right now,

02:13:27.137 --> 02:13:30.257
but I've never gotten the sense that

02:13:30.257 --> 02:13:33.557
it was a particular problem.

02:13:34.739 --> 02:13:36.077
I mean, you know.

02:13:36.077 --> 02:13:41.017
You know you've got a weird, little cult going,

02:13:41.017 --> 02:13:43.127
and that's okay.
(laughter)

02:13:43.127 --> 02:13:45.507
To be fair, I'm in a weird, little cult.

02:13:45.507 --> 02:13:48.147
I mean, there's nothing unusual or wrong about that,

02:13:48.147 --> 02:13:49.447
it's, you know?

02:13:49.447 --> 02:13:52.544
All a god is, really, is a cult with a franchise, so.

02:13:52.544 --> 02:13:54.657
(laughter)

02:13:54.657 --> 02:13:57.795
I mean-- Sorry, I got a little.

02:13:57.795 --> 02:14:00.128
(laughter)

02:14:00.128 --> 02:14:03.454
ASHLEY: But, you know, to that point,

02:14:03.454 --> 02:14:07.404
what isn't a cult, if you're following--

02:14:07.404 --> 02:14:09.487
I'm not helping.

02:14:09.487 --> 02:14:11.107
TALIESIN: I mean--
MARISHA: Speaking of cults,

02:14:11.107 --> 02:14:13.227
this shit is creepy!
ASHLEY: Because where we are now.

02:14:13.227 --> 02:14:14.677
MARISHA: This shit is weird!

02:14:14.677 --> 02:14:16.385
SAM: There's a bunch of weird stuff

02:14:16.385 --> 02:14:17.943
going on, the memory thing.

02:14:17.943 --> 02:14:19.527
TALIESIN: Now that we're in the bubble,

02:14:19.527 --> 02:14:21.177
are we still getting the, like,

02:14:21.177 --> 02:14:23.187
there's something watching vibe?

02:14:23.187 --> 02:14:24.452
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:14:24.452 --> 02:14:27.017
MARISHA and LAURA: Ooh!

02:14:27.017 --> 02:14:30.497
TALIESIN: That's his plan all along, man.

02:14:30.497 --> 02:14:32.137
19.

02:14:32.137 --> 02:14:33.367
MATT: As you're all having this conversation,

02:14:33.367 --> 02:14:35.117
you withdraw,

02:14:35.117 --> 02:14:37.327
and then focus on the surroundings, and

02:14:39.437 --> 02:14:40.603
yeah.

02:14:40.603 --> 02:14:43.017
That still sinking feeling in your chest,

02:14:43.017 --> 02:14:45.550
that sense that something is here.

02:14:45.550 --> 02:14:46.427
MARISHA: This has been since we got here!

02:14:46.427 --> 02:14:47.807
TALIESIN: Serious ramifications.
MARISHA: Since we got off the beach!

02:14:47.807 --> 02:14:49.027
LAURA: Hey, look at my sketchbook!

02:14:49.027 --> 02:14:50.957
Has the Traveler written anything back to me?

02:14:50.957 --> 02:14:53.407
LIAM: Like a Ouija board?
MATT: No, not in the--

02:14:53.407 --> 02:14:56.017
LAURA: I'm going to hold my pen right above it.

02:14:56.017 --> 02:14:58.197
MATT: That would be probably more the category

02:14:58.197 --> 02:14:59.597
of the Commune spell or something to that.

02:14:59.597 --> 02:15:01.547
LAURA: I'm going to cast Commune-
SAM: I will cast Mage Hand,

02:15:01.547 --> 02:15:02.888
and start moving.

02:15:02.888 --> 02:15:05.570
LAURA: He's here! He's saying something!

02:15:05.570 --> 02:15:06.885
MATT: Can you do a sleight of hand check for me?

02:15:06.885 --> 02:15:08.080
SAM: Okay.

02:15:09.237 --> 02:15:10.307
Oh! 17.

02:15:10.307 --> 02:15:12.597
MATT: 17. Passive perception...

02:15:12.597 --> 02:15:15.847
Yeah, no, what do you draw in Jester's notebook?

02:15:15.847 --> 02:15:17.937
SAM: What did she ask, earlier?

02:15:17.937 --> 02:15:19.070
In the book?
LAURA: You don't know what I wrote!

02:15:19.070 --> 02:15:19.987
MATT: You don't know.
SAM: Okay.

02:15:19.987 --> 02:15:20.987
I'll just write--

02:15:22.898 --> 02:15:23.731
(laughter)

02:15:23.731 --> 02:15:26.297
LAURA: And you're drawing with another hand.
TALIESIN: You did this to yourself.

02:15:26.297 --> 02:15:27.497
SAM: I'm drawing, and you're a lefty!

02:15:27.497 --> 02:15:29.042
Oh god, it's going to be awful!

02:15:29.042 --> 02:15:31.537
(laughter)

02:15:31.537 --> 02:15:35.437
SAM: With my right hand holding your left hand,

02:15:35.437 --> 02:15:37.727
I will--

02:15:37.727 --> 02:15:39.087
I will write,

02:15:40.047 --> 02:15:45.022
"Go on, and kiss him tomorrow, Jester.

02:15:46.177 --> 02:15:48.167
"Fjord is ready for you."

02:15:48.167 --> 02:15:49.537
LAURA: You're writing all of that?

02:15:49.537 --> 02:15:52.617
SAM: Well, I'm abbreviating some of it.
LAURA: It's scribbling off the right.

02:15:52.617 --> 02:15:54.465
TRAVIS: It looks like two-year-old wrote it

02:15:54.465 --> 02:15:56.927
with the other hand. (laughter)

02:15:56.927 --> 02:15:58.179
MATT: (speaks gibberish)

02:15:58.179 --> 02:16:00.922
TRAVIS: Didn't you ask what is watching us?

02:16:00.922 --> 02:16:03.064
LAURA: Yes!
(laughter)

02:16:03.064 --> 02:16:04.733
LAURA: You're getting distracted, Traveler.

02:16:04.733 --> 02:16:06.983
(laughter)

02:16:08.726 --> 02:16:13.037
LAURA: I'm going to spend 10 minutes and cast Commune.

02:16:13.897 --> 02:16:14.730
MATT: Okay.

02:16:14.730 --> 02:16:17.067
TALIESIN: Does anyone have an empty slot

02:16:17.067 --> 02:16:19.447
for their equipment slot?
LAURA: (laughs)

02:16:19.447 --> 02:16:21.747
TALIESIN: You're welcome. It's all for you.

02:16:21.747 --> 02:16:24.277
Anybody have an equipment slot they need filled?

02:16:24.277 --> 02:16:25.807
There you are.
LAURA: Yeah, I do.

02:16:25.807 --> 02:16:27.537
I have an empty slot. What do you need?

02:16:27.537 --> 02:16:29.019
MATT: Need someplace to put your stuff.

02:16:29.019 --> 02:16:29.877
LAURA: (giggling)

02:16:29.877 --> 02:16:31.587
TALIESIN: I have a thing that you might--

02:16:31.587 --> 02:16:33.731
I have a thing I'm not using, that I was--

02:16:33.731 --> 02:16:35.981
LAURA: (cackles)

02:16:37.307 --> 02:16:38.437
SAM: You're not using your thing?

02:16:38.437 --> 02:16:40.947
TALIESIN: Why do I even talk to Laura Bailey?

02:16:40.947 --> 02:16:42.657
MATT: I feel you, man.

02:16:42.657 --> 02:16:44.611
(laughter)

02:16:44.611 --> 02:16:45.444
ASHLEY: Yes!

02:16:45.444 --> 02:16:47.127
LIAM: Somebody has to set the bar for us.
LAURA: (laughter) I'm sorry!

02:16:47.127 --> 02:16:48.867
TRAVIS: Against the new hair
color, the red is pushing through.

02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:51.236
TALIESIN: How much of your brain is just euphemism?

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:52.753
Like, just--

02:16:52.753 --> 02:16:55.286
(laughter)

02:16:55.286 --> 02:16:56.570
TALIESIN: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:57.807
LAURA: What do you have?

02:16:57.807 --> 02:17:00.197
(laughter)

02:17:00.197 --> 02:17:01.841
ASHLEY: So much!

02:17:01.841 --> 02:17:02.847
(laughter)

02:17:02.847 --> 02:17:05.007
TALIESIN: I have a--
LIAM: Tomato!

02:17:05.007 --> 02:17:09.105
TALIESIN: I have a Charm of Plant Command

02:17:10.877 --> 02:17:14.067
necklace-- it's on a thread--

02:17:14.067 --> 02:17:17.113
that will give you, three times a day,

02:17:17.113 --> 02:17:20.547
it'll let you not only speak with a plant,

02:17:20.547 --> 02:17:22.087
and have them understand it,

02:17:22.087 --> 02:17:24.498
but they'll talk to you, too.

02:17:24.498 --> 02:17:25.517
LAURA: (gasps)
TALIESIN: And you get an advantage

02:17:25.517 --> 02:17:27.117
on charisma checks to influence

02:17:27.117 --> 02:17:28.893
their behavior, demeanor, and attitude.

02:17:28.893 --> 02:17:30.493
LAURA: Yes, I want that!

02:17:30.493 --> 02:17:32.936
That sound amazing!

02:17:32.936 --> 02:17:35.937
TALIESIN: All right, since I'm not using it, anyway.

02:17:35.937 --> 02:17:36.797
MATT: Sure.

02:17:36.797 --> 02:17:38.957
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to throw you,

02:17:38.957 --> 02:17:40.927
so that you can attune to it tonight.

02:17:40.927 --> 02:17:43.487
LAURA: (gasps)

02:17:43.487 --> 02:17:44.852
SAM: Beautiful!

02:17:44.852 --> 02:17:47.624
LAURA: What does it look like, Caduceus?

02:17:47.624 --> 02:17:49.867
TALIESIN: It is a fist-sized charm that is made

02:17:49.867 --> 02:17:51.337
from a bundle of dried plant stems,

02:17:51.337 --> 02:17:52.977
wrapped in silver thread.
SAM: Ugh!

02:17:52.977 --> 02:17:54.306
TALIESIN: Hung on a leather thong.

02:17:54.306 --> 02:17:55.587
(snickering)
LIAM: Yeah.

02:17:55.587 --> 02:17:57.307
TRAVIS: A leather thong?

02:17:57.307 --> 02:18:00.169
TALIESIN: <i>Hung</i> on a leather thong, thank you.

02:18:00.169 --> 02:18:01.407
It is typically worn around the neck,

02:18:01.407 --> 02:18:02.657
or attached to a belt.

02:18:02.657 --> 02:18:04.803
LAURA: Or over your junk.

02:18:04.803 --> 02:18:06.727
TALIESIN: Or across the junk.

02:18:06.727 --> 02:18:07.769
LIAM: In your slot.

02:18:08.937 --> 02:18:12.427
TALIESIN: To make it a more pleasant--

02:18:12.427 --> 02:18:14.164
TRAVIS: It's good to be back!

02:18:14.164 --> 02:18:16.164
MATT: It's like a thatch cup, essentially.

02:18:16.164 --> 02:18:16.997
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

02:18:16.997 --> 02:18:18.487
LAURA: Oh my god, that's amazing, okay.

02:18:18.487 --> 02:18:21.177
TALIESIN: So if you look up Charm of Plant Command.

02:18:21.177 --> 02:18:22.010
LAURA: Okay.

02:18:22.010 --> 02:18:23.283
TALIESIN: I'm removing mine. It's gone.

02:18:23.283 --> 02:18:24.927
LAURA: I'm going to

02:18:24.927 --> 02:18:27.060
add that in a second after I do my Commune.

02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:28.587
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do your thing and then,

02:18:28.587 --> 02:18:29.930
catch up my shit.

02:18:31.319 --> 02:18:34.833
MATT: So you, after acquiring your Charm of Plant Command,

02:18:34.833 --> 02:18:37.967
you excitedly take a moment to concentrate, and

02:18:37.967 --> 02:18:40.840
reach our your thoughts towards the Traveler.

02:18:43.377 --> 02:18:46.347
Eventually, as everyone else is talking,

02:18:46.347 --> 02:18:48.167
their voices get a little muffled,

02:18:48.167 --> 02:18:51.229
that, you know, Peanuts adult,

02:18:51.229 --> 02:18:54.437
(muffled speech) and you just hear the voice

02:18:54.437 --> 02:18:56.195
over your shoulder once more,

02:18:57.597 --> 02:18:58.430
"You rang?"

02:19:01.354 --> 02:19:03.613
LAURA: What the hell is watching us?

02:19:05.530 --> 02:19:06.678
MATT: You know with Commune,

02:19:06.678 --> 02:19:08.344
generally it's yes or no questions?
LAURA: Yeah, I know!

02:19:08.344 --> 02:19:12.857
(laughter)

02:19:12.857 --> 02:19:16.677
LAURA: Is it Vokodo that's watching us?

02:19:18.267 --> 02:19:19.657
MATT: "From what I can gather,

02:19:20.827 --> 02:19:24.247
"it's quite an observant creature,
everywhere on the island."

02:19:25.257 --> 02:19:26.407
LAURA: Is he actually a god?

02:19:29.119 --> 02:19:31.899
MATT: "Not feeling a god-type presence from the island."

02:19:31.899 --> 02:19:33.803
LAURA: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:19:39.487 --> 02:19:42.212
Do you think

02:19:43.511 --> 02:19:45.127
that people here

02:19:51.843 --> 02:19:55.735
are being influenced by him to stay?

02:19:58.444 --> 02:20:00.297
(laughter)

02:20:00.297 --> 02:20:01.867
MATT: You see out of the corner of your eye,

02:20:01.867 --> 02:20:04.532
the Traveler's waiting for the

02:20:04.532 --> 02:20:06.807
sentence to end and he goes, "Ah,

02:20:09.518 --> 02:20:12.587
"I'd say there's certainly some sort of strange influence.

02:20:12.587 --> 02:20:15.837
"And they're certainly staying."

02:20:16.688 --> 02:20:18.838
LAURA: Yeah.

02:20:18.838 --> 02:20:20.388
I have so many other questions.

02:20:21.647 --> 02:20:23.792
MATT: "Well." (poofs)

02:20:23.792 --> 02:20:24.975
(laughter)

02:20:24.975 --> 02:20:25.808
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:20:26.682 --> 02:20:27.990
Smoke bomb!

02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:32.987
SAM: Jester, did the Traveler confirm what he wrote before?

02:20:33.981 --> 02:20:38.217
LAURA: Oh, I forgot to ask him
about it in my three questions.

02:20:39.159 --> 02:20:40.527
But...
SAM: Must be true!

02:20:40.527 --> 02:20:43.197
LAURA: How did you know what he wrote before?

02:20:43.197 --> 02:20:45.457
SAM: I was invisible and I saw over your shoulder.

02:20:45.457 --> 02:20:47.107
LAURA: You were not invisible; you were sitting right here.

02:20:47.107 --> 02:20:48.447
SAM: I was super invisible!

02:20:48.447 --> 02:20:51.317
You didn't see me over there. I can do that sometimes.

02:20:51.317 --> 02:20:52.567
ASHLEY: What did he write?

02:20:52.567 --> 02:20:53.857
Oh, we can't know.

02:20:53.857 --> 02:20:57.197
LAURA: I'll tell you later.
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:20:57.197 --> 02:20:59.127
SAM: Well, night, night, all.

02:20:59.127 --> 02:21:01.987
TALIESIN: Before we go to sleep, I propose a quick ritual

02:21:01.987 --> 02:21:03.807
that we should adopt while we're on the island

02:21:03.807 --> 02:21:06.282
before we go to sleep and when we wake up.

02:21:08.217 --> 02:21:10.297
My name is Caduceus Clay,

02:21:10.297 --> 02:21:14.457
I'm from the Savalirwood, in the Blooming Grove.

02:21:14.457 --> 02:21:16.197
My father's name is Cornelius,

02:21:16.197 --> 02:21:17.967
my mother's name is Constance.

02:21:17.967 --> 02:21:19.587
I say just say your name, where you're from,

02:21:19.587 --> 02:21:21.747
and one thing about your past.

02:21:21.747 --> 02:21:22.977
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

02:21:22.977 --> 02:21:24.894
TALIESIN: Just for now.

02:21:24.894 --> 02:21:26.177
LAURA: You go, Beau!

02:21:26.177 --> 02:21:28.627
MARISHA: My name is Beauregard Lionett,

02:21:28.627 --> 02:21:30.407
I'm from Kamordah.

02:21:30.407 --> 02:21:33.477
My father's name is Thoreau,

02:21:33.477 --> 02:21:36.425
and I have a little brother named TJ.

02:21:37.323 --> 02:21:40.907
TRAVIS: Right, my name is Fjord, I'm from Port Damali.

02:21:40.907 --> 02:21:44.889
I never knew my parents, but my former captain was Vandran.

02:21:46.447 --> 02:21:50.867
LAURA: My name is Jester Lavorre.

02:21:50.867 --> 02:21:53.535
My mom is the Ruby of the Sea.

02:21:54.610 --> 02:21:56.588
MARISHA: Best lay ever.
LAURA: And...

02:22:00.787 --> 02:22:03.770
my dad...

02:22:03.770 --> 02:22:05.011
sweats a lot!

02:22:08.798 --> 02:22:10.900
LIAM: My name is Caleb Widogast.

02:22:12.647 --> 02:22:16.407
I was not born with the name Caleb Widogast.

02:22:16.407 --> 02:22:20.497
My parents are Una and Leofric.

02:22:23.067 --> 02:22:25.790
SAM: My name is Veth Brenatto,

02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:27.577
and I'm an alcoholic.

02:22:27.577 --> 02:22:28.410
And

02:22:29.687 --> 02:22:33.345
my husband's name is Yeza, my son's name is Luc,

02:22:33.345 --> 02:22:35.457
and I'm from Felderwin.

02:22:36.387 --> 02:22:38.657
ASHLEY: And your parents' names?

02:22:38.657 --> 02:22:40.236
SAM: Oh, I don't remember.

02:22:40.236 --> 02:22:43.494
(laughter)

02:22:43.494 --> 02:22:46.287
ASHLEY: Good, because I remember.

02:22:46.287 --> 02:22:47.647
SAM: You remember my parents' names?

02:22:47.647 --> 02:22:48.480
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:22:49.603 --> 02:22:50.757
SAM: Oh. No, I know it!

02:22:50.757 --> 02:22:52.437
It's Travis and Laura.

02:22:52.437 --> 02:22:53.270
ASHLEY: No.

02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:55.787
LAURA: No, it's Travis and Ashley!
ASHLEY: Close, that is your dad's name.

02:22:55.787 --> 02:22:57.197
SAM: It was Travis and Ashley?

02:22:57.197 --> 02:22:59.537
ASHLEY: But Laura works, too.

02:22:59.537 --> 02:23:00.874
Laura Ashley.

02:23:00.874 --> 02:23:02.251
(laughter)

02:23:02.251 --> 02:23:03.672
SAM: It's Travis and Ashley? Is that what I said

02:23:03.672 --> 02:23:05.551
before when I made that shit up? Okay.

02:23:05.551 --> 02:23:06.707
(laughter)

02:23:06.707 --> 02:23:08.927
ASHLEY: Good memory!

02:23:08.927 --> 02:23:12.807
My name is Yasha Nydoorin.

02:23:12.807 --> 02:23:16.327
I am from the southern wastes of Xhorhas.

02:23:18.067 --> 02:23:23.067
And I don't know who my parents are, so.

02:23:23.127 --> 02:23:24.327
SAM: But your wife?

02:23:25.907 --> 02:23:29.952
ASHLEY: Yes, I was married to a woman named Zuala.

02:23:31.277 --> 02:23:33.647
TALIESIN: I assume it'll just be a will check, but yeah.

02:23:33.647 --> 02:23:35.007
MATT: Yeah, so you all--
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:23:35.007 --> 02:23:36.897
LAURA: Hey, also! Guess what?

02:23:36.897 --> 02:23:38.977
The Traveler basically confirmed that

02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:41.477
Vokodo is not actually a god!

02:23:41.477 --> 02:23:43.143
MARISHA: Really?
SAM: We got nothing to worry about, then.

02:23:43.143 --> 02:23:44.037
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:23:44.037 --> 02:23:45.607
MARISHA: That almost makes me more nervous.

02:23:45.607 --> 02:23:46.937
TALIESIN: Yeah, could be a--

02:23:46.937 --> 02:23:48.117
SAM: We'll give him some stuff,

02:23:48.117 --> 02:23:50.317
then we'll go hiking and find some dinosaurs.

02:23:50.317 --> 02:23:51.977
MARISHA: Okay, but did he give any indication

02:23:51.977 --> 02:23:53.807
on this, like, creepy feeling,

02:23:53.807 --> 02:23:55.322
that just like--?

02:23:55.322 --> 02:23:58.667
LAURA: He said that he thinks
it's the thing, whatever it is.

02:23:58.667 --> 02:24:00.357
MARISHA: He thinks it's the thing.

02:24:00.357 --> 02:24:02.235
That it's Avocado?

02:24:02.235 --> 02:24:03.397
LAURA: Yeah.

02:24:03.397 --> 02:24:04.467
TALIESIN: Too much avocado.

02:24:04.467 --> 02:24:06.247
MARISHA: Avocado's watching us at all times.

02:24:06.247 --> 02:24:07.080
LAURA: Yeah.

02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:09.617
SAM: Maybe we should-- since he can see us all the time?

02:24:10.777 --> 02:24:13.254
Maybe we should call him Guacamole instead or something.

02:24:13.254 --> 02:24:14.945
Just so he doesn't know.
LAURA: Oh, so he doesn't know.

02:24:14.945 --> 02:24:16.058
MARISHA: That's good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:24:16.058 --> 02:24:17.724
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:24:17.724 --> 02:24:18.885
LIAM: Kokomo.

02:24:18.885 --> 02:24:21.602
(laughter)

02:24:21.602 --> 02:24:23.328
MARISHA: Good old Guac.
TRAVIS: ♪ Aruba, Jamaica ♪

02:24:23.328 --> 02:24:26.488
♪ Ooh, I want to take ya ♪
(laughter)

02:24:26.488 --> 02:24:29.185
ASHLEY: ♪ Key Largo, Montego ♪

02:24:29.185 --> 02:24:30.827
MARISHA: Has anyone noticed, like, okay--

02:24:30.827 --> 02:24:32.260
sorry, I know we all want to go to bed,

02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:34.140
I know we all want to go to bed.
TRAVIS: Why don't we fucking go on break?

02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:35.471
(laughter)

02:24:35.471 --> 02:24:36.779
MARISHA: You know, I'll been thinking about this--

02:24:36.779 --> 02:24:37.737
LAURA: No, no, no, what?

02:24:37.737 --> 02:24:39.097
MARISHA: I'm going to write a little bit.

02:24:39.097 --> 02:24:40.317
I just need to think.

02:24:40.317 --> 02:24:42.147
I need to think. I'm going to just journal.

02:24:42.147 --> 02:24:43.497
I'm going to journal.
MATT: Okay.

02:24:43.497 --> 02:24:45.727
MARISHA: See but-- I'm going to--
we'll talk in a little bit.

02:24:45.727 --> 02:24:49.300
ALL: (scatting)

02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:55.309
(laughter)

02:24:55.683 --> 02:24:56.633
TALIESIN: Oh, I missed this.

02:24:56.633 --> 02:24:58.967
MATT: As you all gently find yourselves

02:24:58.967 --> 02:25:00.737
succumbing to a night's rest

02:25:00.737 --> 02:25:04.511
to the sound of a soft, distant scat...

02:25:04.511 --> 02:25:06.497
(laughter)

02:25:06.497 --> 02:25:08.287
LIAM: Yeah, Caleb takes a while to go to sleep,

02:25:08.287 --> 02:25:09.797
and watches the others nod off,

02:25:09.797 --> 02:25:12.452
and listens to Beau quietly scatting in the corner.

02:25:12.452 --> 02:25:13.745
(laughter)

02:25:13.745 --> 02:25:16.117
And just twirls that same wand from Calianna,

02:25:16.117 --> 02:25:18.507
and just watches the group.

02:25:18.507 --> 02:25:20.157
Like taps the wand on his forehead lightly

02:25:20.157 --> 02:25:22.325
as he watches and listens.

02:25:22.325 --> 02:25:23.867
Then eventually goes to sleep.

02:25:23.867 --> 02:25:24.717
MATT: Okay.

02:25:24.717 --> 02:25:26.372
MARISHA: They get ASMR.

02:25:26.372 --> 02:25:28.831
LIAM: (singing scat)

02:25:28.831 --> 02:25:29.951
ASHLEY: Wait, do the--

02:25:29.951 --> 02:25:32.387
SAM: Yeah, we can hear it.
(pencil scratching)

02:25:32.387 --> 02:25:34.581
SAM: That's good stuff.

02:25:34.581 --> 02:25:36.207
(laughter)

02:25:36.207 --> 02:25:39.297
LAURA: Jester lets out a little toot as she's--

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:41.437
after she goes to sleep.

02:25:41.437 --> 02:25:42.427
Just a teeny one.

02:25:42.427 --> 02:25:44.487
MARISHA: That was cute.
MATT: A little tiefling toot?

02:25:44.487 --> 02:25:45.637
LAURA: Yeah.

02:25:45.637 --> 02:25:46.470
MATT: All righty.

02:25:47.337 --> 02:25:50.547
Sleep takes you all, night's rest is had, long rest.

02:25:52.517 --> 02:25:54.977
And as the morning comes, and consciousness

02:25:54.977 --> 02:25:59.172
finally calls you back to the world of the waking,

02:26:00.449 --> 02:26:01.282
we're going to break.

02:26:01.282 --> 02:26:02.787
(exclaiming)

02:26:02.787 --> 02:26:04.687
MATT: Because we went long.
LAURA: I thought we hadn't done that yet.

02:26:04.687 --> 02:26:05.577
MATT: No, we haven't had a break yet!

02:26:05.577 --> 02:26:07.147
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?
You don't have to pee like crazy?

02:26:07.147 --> 02:26:07.980
LAURA: No.

02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:08.813
ASHLEY: I have to pee like--

02:26:08.813 --> 02:26:09.646
I have to pee.

02:26:09.646 --> 02:26:10.857
MATT: Well.
TRAVIS: Journal some more, Beau!

02:26:10.857 --> 02:26:12.723
MATT: Indeed, it's all good.

02:26:12.723 --> 02:26:13.777
We don't have any announcements,

02:26:13.777 --> 02:26:14.787
or giveaways for the break,

02:26:14.787 --> 02:26:15.917
so we're just going to go straight to break!

02:26:15.917 --> 02:26:17.531
We'll see you guys here shortly.

02:26:17.531 --> 02:26:18.865
(cheering)

02:45:32.875 --> 02:45:36.730
MATT: And welcome back. So...
(laughter)

02:45:36.730 --> 02:45:39.093
The Mighty Nein.
ASHLEY: I'm so happy!

02:45:39.093 --> 02:45:41.803
MATT: After a night's rest, the morning comes,

02:45:41.803 --> 02:45:43.410
you awaken refreshed.

02:45:44.313 --> 02:45:46.496
I need you all to roll an
investigation check for me, please.

02:45:46.496 --> 02:45:47.986
TRAVIS: (groans) What, in the bubble?

02:45:47.986 --> 02:45:49.373
LAURA: But we rolled so well before!

02:45:49.373 --> 02:45:51.303
SAM: I know, I think he's-
ASHLEY: Investigation?

02:45:51.303 --> 02:45:52.136
MATT: Yes, please.

02:45:52.136 --> 02:45:53.653
SAM: He's hiding this check

02:45:53.653 --> 02:45:56.525
that's going to make us forget shit!

02:45:56.525 --> 02:45:57.358
MARISHA: Okay.

02:45:57.358 --> 02:45:59.103
TRAVIS: 21.
MATT: Okay.

02:45:59.103 --> 02:46:01.246
TRAVIS: Which is really good for me.

02:46:01.246 --> 02:46:02.739
SAM: Ooh, not as good.

02:46:02.739 --> 02:46:04.433
LAURA: Four.
MATT: Four, okay.

02:46:04.433 --> 02:46:05.613
LIAM: 24.
MATT: All right.

02:46:05.613 --> 02:46:07.263
SAM: 18.
MATT: Okay.

02:46:07.263 --> 02:46:08.893
ASHLEY: Eight.
MATT: Okay.

02:46:08.893 --> 02:46:10.213
TALIESIN: 10.
MATT: Okay.

02:46:10.213 --> 02:46:12.547
MARISHA: 19.
MATT: All right.

02:46:12.547 --> 02:46:15.593
Caduceus, Yasha, Jester,

02:46:15.593 --> 02:46:17.103
pick an item in your inventory.

02:46:17.103 --> 02:46:20.185
SAM: Oh, no!
LAURA: I knew it!

02:46:20.185 --> 02:46:22.743
Those fuckers are going to steal shit!

02:46:22.743 --> 02:46:24.920
TRAVIS: No, they can't. They can't come in the bubble.

02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:27.013
LIAM: No one can come in the bubble,
unless they're burrowing up.

02:46:27.013 --> 02:46:29.143
Burrowing, like from below!
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

02:46:29.143 --> 02:46:30.573
LIAM: Or it's the god thing.

02:46:30.573 --> 02:46:34.333
SAM: Or they're, like, compelling you to give it to them!

02:46:34.333 --> 02:46:35.793
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:46:35.793 --> 02:46:37.633
LAURA: Anything? What do we pick?

02:46:37.633 --> 02:46:38.883
MATT: Pick an object in your inventory,

02:46:38.883 --> 02:46:40.143
just something that you have.

02:46:40.143 --> 02:46:42.093
SAM: Just anything?
MATT: Anything.

02:46:42.093 --> 02:46:44.053
ASHLEY: Like a bedroll?

02:46:44.053 --> 02:46:45.523
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:46:45.523 --> 02:46:49.610
A ball bearing. Do you have, like, a screw?

02:46:50.963 --> 02:46:52.883
MATT: You can't choose, like, a single ball bearing.

02:46:52.883 --> 02:46:54.193
It would be your ball bearings.

02:46:54.193 --> 02:46:55.273
TRAVIS: You got to a troll dick in there

02:46:55.273 --> 02:46:56.701
that you want to get rid of?
TALIESIN: Tinderbox.

02:46:56.701 --> 02:46:58.367
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: Tinderbox?

02:46:58.367 --> 02:46:59.453
ASHLEY: I have a blanket.

02:46:59.453 --> 02:47:00.873
I'm going to get rid of my blanket.

02:47:00.873 --> 02:47:01.753
SAM: Have a blanket!

02:47:01.753 --> 02:47:03.113
MATT: Well, you don't know what's happening to it.

02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:04.479
I'm just saying.

02:47:05.421 --> 02:47:07.365
So tinderbox.

02:47:07.365 --> 02:47:10.060
ASHLEY: Yeah, a blanket.
MATT: A blanket, okay.

02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:10.893
Jester?

02:47:10.893 --> 02:47:12.722
LAURA: I have a bottle of hair oil.

02:47:12.722 --> 02:47:14.323
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: Okay.

02:47:14.323 --> 02:47:16.700
TRAVIS: Oh, from the crazy ass shop?

02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:17.533
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: That thing is nasty.

02:47:17.533 --> 02:47:18.973
MATT: Okay.

02:47:18.973 --> 02:47:21.276
So you all wake up, and you all gather your things,

02:47:21.276 --> 02:47:24.383
and morning has begun. What do you want to do?

02:47:24.383 --> 02:47:27.650
TRAVIS: We want to, of course, go find Viridian.

02:47:28.794 --> 02:47:30.423
TALIESIN: Memory check, first thing in the morning.

02:47:30.423 --> 02:47:32.333
We don't obviously want to go around, just as a-

02:47:32.333 --> 02:47:34.135
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Beauregard Lionett.

02:47:34.135 --> 02:47:35.732
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Hey, Beau.

02:47:35.732 --> 02:47:36.814
MARISHA: Yeah, hey.
TALIESIN: Yeah, Clay.

02:47:36.814 --> 02:47:37.932
LAURA: (quick mumbling)

02:47:37.932 --> 02:47:39.883
LIAM: (quick mumbling)

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:41.053
TRAVIS: Sam, participate!

02:47:41.053 --> 02:47:42.145
SAM: Oh sorry, what?

02:47:42.145 --> 02:47:43.983
(laughter)
TRAVIS: It's happening.

02:47:43.983 --> 02:47:45.353
LAURA: It's already happening!

02:47:45.353 --> 02:47:47.503
SAM: Oh, it's just-- I just can't remember

02:47:47.503 --> 02:47:48.948
what we were doing today.

02:47:48.948 --> 02:47:50.153
(laughter)

02:47:50.153 --> 02:47:52.033
TRAVIS: We all recite the memory thing.

02:47:52.033 --> 02:47:52.963
SAM: We're doing that again?

02:47:52.963 --> 02:47:54.870
TRAVIS: Yeah, because we woke up.
TALIESIN: Not, not...

02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:56.086
LAURA: Not really.
MATT: You're just checking

02:47:56.086 --> 02:47:57.752
just to make sure you're fine.
TALIESIN: Checking to make sure it worked.

02:47:57.752 --> 02:48:00.269
MATT: Yeah, and none of you have any

02:48:00.269 --> 02:48:02.238
memory-lapsed issues.

02:48:02.238 --> 02:48:04.813
TRAVIS: Should we make our way out to try and find her?

02:48:04.813 --> 02:48:08.583
MATT: Yasha, the blanket that you generally keep

02:48:08.583 --> 02:48:13.158
as just one element of comfort amongst the harsh interiors.

02:48:13.158 --> 02:48:14.743
You don't know where it is. You can't find it.

02:48:14.743 --> 02:48:15.843
ASHLEY: What?

02:48:17.295 --> 02:48:18.643
I had a...

02:48:18.643 --> 02:48:19.663
LIAM: What's the matter?

02:48:19.663 --> 02:48:20.763
SAM: Is your woobie gone?

02:48:21.673 --> 02:48:22.983
ASHLEY: My woobie?
LIAM: Wow.

02:48:22.983 --> 02:48:23.863
SAM: Yeah.

02:48:23.863 --> 02:48:24.713
ASHLEY: What's my woobie?

02:48:24.713 --> 02:48:28.023
SAM: You know, your bunky, your binky, your blanky?

02:48:28.023 --> 02:48:29.178
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:48:31.274 --> 02:48:32.829
Yeah, it's gone.

02:48:32.829 --> 02:48:34.643
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:48:34.643 --> 02:48:37.213
ASHLEY: And I'm British!
(laughter)

02:48:38.761 --> 02:48:40.069
MATT: Whoa!

02:48:40.912 --> 02:48:43.555
ASHLEY: I don't remember how I used to speak!

02:48:44.635 --> 02:48:45.468
Who am I?

02:48:46.812 --> 02:48:47.719
MATT: There's weird shit here!

02:48:47.719 --> 02:48:48.820
(laughter)

02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:50.953
You can look for it, if you want to make a perception check.

02:48:50.953 --> 02:48:52.590
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to...
MATT: Okay.

02:48:54.342 --> 02:48:56.293
ASHLEY: Do you see-- is it here?

02:48:56.293 --> 02:48:57.760
LAURA: What color was it?

02:48:57.760 --> 02:48:59.593
ASHLEY: It's just black.

02:48:59.593 --> 02:49:01.853
LAURA: Is it this one?
ASHLEY: My black blanket.

02:49:01.853 --> 02:49:02.686
No.

02:49:02.686 --> 02:49:04.113
LAURA: Is it this one?

02:49:04.113 --> 02:49:05.723
MARISHA: That's mine!
ASHLEY: 19.

02:49:05.723 --> 02:49:07.243
MATT: 19?

02:49:07.243 --> 02:49:09.163
You take a little bit of time in the house,

02:49:09.163 --> 02:49:11.533
and you end up finding it, tucked under one of the beds.

02:49:11.533 --> 02:49:13.283
SAM: Oh!
MATT: You just lost track of it.

02:49:14.133 --> 02:49:14.983
It's weird.

02:49:14.983 --> 02:49:15.816
SAM: Okay.

02:49:17.093 --> 02:49:18.076
LAURA: What the fuck?
MARISHA: Maybe you moved it

02:49:18.076 --> 02:49:19.026
in the middle of your sleep.

02:49:19.026 --> 02:49:20.023
ASHLEY: Out of the bubble?

02:49:21.213 --> 02:49:22.743
MATT: Yeah.

02:49:22.743 --> 02:49:24.123
LAURA: What the...

02:49:25.113 --> 02:49:27.578
SAM: Sometimes you walk in your--

02:49:27.578 --> 02:49:29.613
you're a sleepwalker.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I sleepwalk.

02:49:29.613 --> 02:49:31.523
SAM: Called to storms and things.

02:49:33.178 --> 02:49:35.213
ASHLEY: But wouldn't you have been alerted

02:49:35.213 --> 02:49:37.326
if I walked out of the bubble?

02:49:38.913 --> 02:49:39.899
LIAM: No.

02:49:40.958 --> 02:49:43.670
Just no one can come in except for all of you.

02:49:44.883 --> 02:49:47.453
I don't say anything, but I ask Frumpkin

02:49:47.453 --> 02:49:50.813
if anyone was monkeying about in here in the night.

02:49:50.813 --> 02:49:52.365
MATT: Roll a perception check for Frumpkin.

02:49:52.365 --> 02:49:53.445
LIAM: Okay.

02:49:55.743 --> 02:49:56.576
LIAM: 19.

02:49:56.576 --> 02:49:57.483
MATT: 19.
SAM: Whoa!

02:49:57.483 --> 02:49:58.713
MATT: Best to Frumpkin's knowledge,

02:49:58.713 --> 02:50:00.326
there wasn't any sort of movement,

02:50:00.326 --> 02:50:03.133
or anything strange, untoward.
ASHLEY: What the fuck?

02:50:03.133 --> 02:50:07.225
LIAM: And did any of the Nein
leave the bubble at nighttime?

02:50:07.225 --> 02:50:08.520
MATT: No.
LIAM: Okay.

02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:11.743
ASHLEY: Can I-- as I get my blanket from under the bed,

02:50:11.743 --> 02:50:12.743
can I

02:50:14.053 --> 02:50:15.643
search under the bed?

02:50:15.643 --> 02:50:18.069
MATT: Yeah, you look under it. It's fairly empty.

02:50:18.069 --> 02:50:20.413
A large bit of dust, some dirt.

02:50:20.413 --> 02:50:24.063
You do find a large dead beetle.

02:50:24.063 --> 02:50:25.793
It's been dead for a while.

02:50:25.793 --> 02:50:26.761
ASHLEY: I'll eat it.

02:50:26.761 --> 02:50:29.063
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

02:50:29.063 --> 02:50:30.984
Hey, waste not, want not, right?

02:50:30.984 --> 02:50:33.392
But that's about it, nothing beyond that.

02:50:33.392 --> 02:50:36.293
(laughter)

02:50:36.293 --> 02:50:37.568
MARISHA: That's amazing!

02:50:40.553 --> 02:50:42.373
ASHLEY: That's fucking weird!
MARISHA: Jester?

02:50:42.373 --> 02:50:44.668
Is this, like, some Traveler shit?
SAM: You know what, you were so overcome,

02:50:44.668 --> 02:50:46.603
by the majesty of your performance,

02:50:46.603 --> 02:50:49.093
that you just did some weird things last night.

02:50:49.093 --> 02:50:51.613
It was a really fantastic performance.

02:50:51.613 --> 02:50:54.245
ASHLEY: Well, thank you, I don't feel like--

02:50:54.245 --> 02:50:57.623
I feel like that doesn't usually happen that well,

02:50:57.623 --> 02:50:59.643
so that was kind of nice.

02:50:59.643 --> 02:51:01.100
I don't know why that happened.

02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:01.933
SAM: It was beautiful!

02:51:01.933 --> 02:51:02.766
ASHLEY: But I was just feeling--

02:51:02.766 --> 02:51:04.973
LAURA: You're just really talented, Yasha!

02:51:04.973 --> 02:51:06.543
LIAM: You're growing into it.

02:51:06.543 --> 02:51:09.743
ASHLEY: Yeah, well, I'm practicing, that's for sure.

02:51:10.772 --> 02:51:12.533
I'm trying to get better at it, at least.

02:51:12.533 --> 02:51:13.366
TRAVIS: It shows!

02:51:13.366 --> 02:51:15.610
ASHLEY: I guess practice makes perfect.

02:51:18.873 --> 02:51:19.706
Okay.

02:51:19.706 --> 02:51:20.997
LIAM: Did you take her blanket?

02:51:20.997 --> 02:51:22.093
LAURA: Did I take her blanket?

02:51:22.093 --> 02:51:24.543
LIAM: Yeah, were you doing hijinks in the night?
LAURA: Why would I have taken her blanket?

02:51:24.543 --> 02:51:26.033
LIAM: Well, you are tricksy.

02:51:26.033 --> 02:51:26.933
TRAVIS: It's a blanket!

02:51:26.933 --> 02:51:28.846
LAURA: That's boring. That's a boring trick.

02:51:28.846 --> 02:51:29.873
TRAVIS: Let's go!

02:51:29.873 --> 02:51:32.038
SAM: Yeah, let's go see a non-god!
TRAVIS: What's with all this [inaudible].

02:51:32.038 --> 02:51:33.712
For fuck's sake!

02:51:33.712 --> 02:51:37.063
SAM: People choose some shit to give to this guy, all right?

02:51:37.063 --> 02:51:38.883
I don't want to get there and hem and ha!

02:51:38.883 --> 02:51:40.923
MARISHA: I've got a couple of gold rings.
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go!

02:51:40.923 --> 02:51:42.040
TALIESIN: I've got a few things.
SAM: Great!

02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:44.106
MARISHA: Okay. Same, okay.

02:51:45.293 --> 02:51:47.033
I still might take off my bracers,

02:51:47.033 --> 02:51:49.648
and like-- no, I don't want to take off my bracers.

02:51:50.773 --> 02:51:52.023
I'll give him gold rings.

02:51:52.913 --> 02:51:53.746
SAM: Great!

02:51:53.746 --> 02:51:54.929
TALIESIN: I'll...

02:51:56.304 --> 02:51:57.137
I don't know.
MARISHA: Do you think he wants this

02:51:57.137 --> 02:51:58.910
pearl necklace, too?

02:51:58.910 --> 02:52:00.913
LAURA: Well, don't-- just see how much he wants.

02:52:00.913 --> 02:52:02.583
Why you got to give him...?
MARISHA: Okay.

02:52:02.583 --> 02:52:03.793
Just, this island freaks me out!

02:52:03.793 --> 02:52:05.733
I'm overthinking it. I'm sorry!

02:52:05.733 --> 02:52:08.433
LAURA: He's just a dude pretending to be a god.

02:52:08.433 --> 02:52:09.763
Let's just figure this out.

02:52:09.763 --> 02:52:11.533
Not that there's anything wrong with that!

02:52:11.533 --> 02:52:13.723
SAM: No! (laughter)

02:52:14.942 --> 02:52:16.393
All right.
MATT: All right.

02:52:16.393 --> 02:52:19.323
SAM: We'll go meet our guide.

02:52:19.323 --> 02:52:20.156
MATT: Easy enough to do.

02:52:20.156 --> 02:52:22.215
As you guys exit the village,

02:52:22.215 --> 02:52:26.223
it's early enough, it's maybe 30 minutes past the sunrise.

02:52:26.223 --> 02:52:27.233
Not everyone's awake.

02:52:27.233 --> 02:52:29.743
Some people are beginning their day,

02:52:29.743 --> 02:52:33.283
a little, like, bleary-eyed, and moving materials

02:52:33.283 --> 02:52:34.753
from one part of the village to the other,

02:52:34.753 --> 02:52:36.603
gathering some things, starting to poke around

02:52:36.603 --> 02:52:38.343
the remnants of the bonfires from the night before

02:52:38.343 --> 02:52:43.343
to prep it for whenever the next large fire might be.

02:52:43.983 --> 02:52:47.353
But there, not far from the exterior

02:52:47.353 --> 02:52:49.833
of where you stayed the night, you do find Viridian,

02:52:49.833 --> 02:52:52.343
waiting with a little pack over her shoulder

02:52:52.343 --> 02:52:56.493
that's made of vines, and some heavy leaves,

02:52:56.493 --> 02:52:58.263
all woven together.

02:52:58.263 --> 02:53:00.645
MARISHA: I just whisper to everybody else:

02:53:00.645 --> 02:53:04.893
From here on out, we should refer to Vokodo as Guacamole.

02:53:04.893 --> 02:53:06.788
Just because we don't want to like, you know,

02:53:06.788 --> 02:53:07.970
piss off Viridian.

02:53:07.970 --> 02:53:09.636
TALIESIN: I'm not sure that's a better thing.
ASHLEY: That's right, that's right.

02:53:09.636 --> 02:53:10.503
Not to offend anybody.

02:53:10.503 --> 02:53:11.973
MARISHA: Yeah, right right, just Guacamole.

02:53:11.973 --> 02:53:13.263
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: While we're gone,

02:53:13.263 --> 02:53:15.843
do you think we should ask one of the villagers

02:53:15.843 --> 02:53:17.483
to maybe run down to the beach

02:53:17.483 --> 02:53:20.457
and get some of our stuff for us, no?

02:53:20.457 --> 02:53:22.229
No, no?

02:53:22.229 --> 02:53:23.173
No?

02:53:23.173 --> 02:53:24.223
Okay.

02:53:24.223 --> 02:53:25.056
On we go!

02:53:25.056 --> 02:53:26.189
TRAVIS: They're dead.

02:53:27.093 --> 02:53:29.800
MATT: (as Viridian) "All right, then."
LAURA: I wonder if we should check in?

02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:31.737
SAM: We could do it while we walk?

02:53:31.737 --> 02:53:33.253
LAURA: Yeah.

02:53:33.253 --> 02:53:34.653
MATT: "All right.

02:53:34.653 --> 02:53:36.583
"This way, then.

02:53:36.583 --> 02:53:38.103
"You have everything you need?"

02:53:38.103 --> 02:53:40.633
TRAVIS: Is it just the-- our party and you?

02:53:40.633 --> 02:53:41.823
Anyone else?

02:53:41.823 --> 02:53:42.943
MATT: "Yes."

02:53:42.943 --> 02:53:43.776
TRAVIS: Wonderful.

02:53:43.776 --> 02:53:46.993
MATT: "The more folk the least useful it is

02:53:46.993 --> 02:53:48.401
"to have such a large party."

02:53:48.401 --> 02:53:49.234
TRAVIS: Of course.

02:53:50.073 --> 02:53:52.556
MATT: "Honestly, this is even more than would be easier.

02:53:52.556 --> 02:53:54.548
"I would normally just fly straight there, but--

02:53:54.548 --> 02:53:56.592
LAURA: Fly! That's what you do, you fly!

02:53:56.592 --> 02:53:58.154
MATT: "Yes."

02:53:58.154 --> 02:53:59.283
TALIESIN: Clever.
MATT: "But...

02:54:00.373 --> 02:54:02.091
"Onward."

02:54:02.091 --> 02:54:03.723
And with that, Viridian leads you

02:54:03.723 --> 02:54:05.793
out on the northwestern side of the village,

02:54:05.793 --> 02:54:10.790
breaking the outer treeline, into the dense jungle itself.

02:54:12.375 --> 02:54:16.453
Now, you guys push in for a short time,

02:54:16.453 --> 02:54:18.093
before you begin to realize the jungle itself

02:54:18.093 --> 02:54:22.833
beginning to grow darker, even more dense.

02:54:22.833 --> 02:54:24.683
The smells, the vegetation, and humid air

02:54:24.683 --> 02:54:29.683
shifting to an even colder, almost metallic scent.

02:54:30.883 --> 02:54:31.716
Unnatural.

02:54:33.303 --> 02:54:36.780
Like a wet iron-type smell to the air.

02:54:39.003 --> 02:54:40.963
No more than probably an hour into this journey or so,

02:54:40.963 --> 02:54:43.663
Viridian puts a hand up for a bit and points,

02:54:43.663 --> 02:54:45.883
and goes, "Those vines there,

02:54:45.883 --> 02:54:48.433
"the ones with the somewhat ruddy
texture towards the bottom points,"

02:54:48.433 --> 02:54:52.403
and you see across the multiple types of vine tangles

02:54:52.403 --> 02:54:55.543
around there, and large branches that are reaching,

02:54:55.543 --> 02:54:57.803
and jamming, intertwining with each other,

02:54:57.803 --> 02:54:59.903
you see some vines, of a thinner variety,

02:54:59.903 --> 02:55:03.024
that, as opposed to winding around, they dangle straight,

02:55:03.024 --> 02:55:04.623
almost like curtains.

02:55:04.623 --> 02:55:06.418
But they turn reddish,

02:55:06.418 --> 02:55:08.468
as they get closer and closer to the tip.

02:55:09.423 --> 02:55:10.723
She points them out,

02:55:11.773 --> 02:55:15.303
"Avoid those, like, keep a distance.

02:55:15.303 --> 02:55:18.411
"They are carnivorous."

02:55:18.411 --> 02:55:20.043
And as you glance up, you can see,

02:55:20.043 --> 02:55:22.203
there's a lot of the moss, the thick, dark moss,

02:55:22.203 --> 02:55:24.217
that grows up in these parts of the trees,

02:55:24.217 --> 02:55:27.753
on these vines, the moss,

02:55:27.753 --> 02:55:29.323
looks less moss, and you now get to see it,

02:55:29.323 --> 02:55:31.323
as it looks like strips of decaying flesh.

02:55:31.323 --> 02:55:32.156
LAURA: Whoa!

02:55:32.156 --> 02:55:33.643
MATT: And occasionally, in some of these knots and tangles,

02:55:33.643 --> 02:55:35.063
you can see a bone protruding,

02:55:35.063 --> 02:55:40.063
or remnants of some sort of decaying creature's remnants.

02:55:40.759 --> 02:55:41.926
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:55:43.065 --> 02:55:46.339
MATT: Used the same word twice in the same phrase.

02:55:46.339 --> 02:55:47.893
Improvisation!

02:55:47.893 --> 02:55:50.693
But the mist itself seems to be taking on this

02:55:50.693 --> 02:55:52.633
iron-like taste.

02:55:52.633 --> 02:55:54.073
As you continue to push forward.

02:55:54.073 --> 02:55:58.283
MARISHA: Does it feel like the bloody remains

02:55:58.283 --> 02:56:01.493
are contributing to that irony taste?

02:56:01.493 --> 02:56:03.673
Or does that feel separate?

02:56:03.673 --> 02:56:06.623
MATT: There's similarities in
that taste, but it's not blood.

02:56:06.623 --> 02:56:08.948
You know the taste of blood very well.

02:56:08.948 --> 02:56:11.373
You've taste a lot of your own in the past.

02:56:11.373 --> 02:56:15.543
But it's different. This is a sharper, and more--

02:56:17.783 --> 02:56:20.413
more unnatural scent.

02:56:20.413 --> 02:56:22.513
LAURA: Does the presence, the watching,

02:56:22.513 --> 02:56:24.021
does it feel stronger?

02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:27.723
MATT: It feels unchanged.

02:56:27.723 --> 02:56:28.556
LAURA: Okay.

02:56:32.503 --> 02:56:34.563
MATT: As you begin to continue, you can see the moisture

02:56:34.563 --> 02:56:36.783
in the surrounding mists growing thicker.

02:56:36.783 --> 02:56:39.867
The tree trunks themselves are now growing slick

02:56:39.867 --> 02:56:41.793
with the liquid in the air.

02:56:41.793 --> 02:56:45.943
You can see drops of condensed moisture,

02:56:45.943 --> 02:56:48.613
falling from branches, and overhead areas.

02:56:48.613 --> 02:56:50.706
It is not a rainy day, but occasionally,

02:56:50.706 --> 02:56:53.393
there is enough moisture falling from the boughs above,

02:56:53.393 --> 02:56:56.016
that it feels like a gentle drizzle.

02:56:58.873 --> 02:57:03.603
You can see now, as the ground begins to roll

02:57:03.603 --> 02:57:07.903
with the terrain, there are little pools beginning to form.

02:57:07.903 --> 02:57:11.243
Dark, pools of liquid.

02:57:11.243 --> 02:57:14.150
At this point, Viridian once again

02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:15.563
places a hand up into the air

02:57:15.563 --> 02:57:17.163
to keep you all at bay and goes,

02:57:19.113 --> 02:57:20.843
"Now, some of these pools

02:57:22.387 --> 02:57:24.203
"contain just liquid,

02:57:24.203 --> 02:57:27.998
"but there are some creatures that reside beneath them

02:57:27.998 --> 02:57:32.897
"and exude a sticky substance,

02:57:32.897 --> 02:57:35.421
"to attempt to trap you.

02:57:35.421 --> 02:57:38.217
"Try your best to avoid

02:57:38.217 --> 02:57:41.067
"touching the pools of liquid.

02:57:42.238 --> 02:57:43.408
"Understood?"

02:57:43.408 --> 02:57:44.323
SAM: Yes, yeah.

02:57:44.323 --> 02:57:45.473
LAURA: Wait, what? I wasn't listening.

02:57:45.473 --> 02:57:47.453
SAM: Don't touch the pools of liquid!

02:57:47.453 --> 02:57:48.403
LAURA: Where?

02:57:48.403 --> 02:57:49.236
TRAVIS: On the floor.

02:57:49.236 --> 02:57:51.683
LIAM: All of these around us. There some things living--
ASHLEY: All about.

02:57:51.683 --> 02:57:52.865
TRAVIS: Maybe listen a little better.

02:57:52.865 --> 02:57:55.063
LAURA: I'm sorry, I was just really checking out

02:57:55.063 --> 02:57:57.363
my awesome charm, is all.

02:57:57.363 --> 02:57:58.383
Okay.

02:57:58.383 --> 02:58:00.033
MATT: "Understood."

02:58:00.033 --> 02:58:03.313
You watch as Viridian's body contorts

02:58:03.313 --> 02:58:06.693
into a small spiral before there is a shift

02:58:06.693 --> 02:58:09.306
of greenish-brown energy, and suddenly wings

02:58:09.306 --> 02:58:10.753
(flapping) come out,

02:58:10.753 --> 02:58:12.013
and where once there was Viridian,

02:58:12.013 --> 02:58:13.528
there is now an owl.

02:58:13.528 --> 02:58:15.293
(gasping)

02:58:15.293 --> 02:58:18.093
MATT: Goes and lands on an upper branch to watch all of you.

02:58:19.271 --> 02:58:21.658
And she's just keeping an eye.

02:58:21.658 --> 02:58:22.491
SAM: Oh.

02:58:22.491 --> 02:58:24.313
TRAVIS: Well, that's convenient.

02:58:24.313 --> 02:58:26.624
SAM: Are we supposed to keep going?

02:58:26.624 --> 02:58:29.566
TRAVIS: I believe in the direction that she flew?

02:58:29.566 --> 02:58:31.341
MATT: You might imagine so.

02:58:32.203 --> 02:58:34.933
You guys begin-- first off, what is the marching order,

02:58:34.933 --> 02:58:36.401
if you don't mind?
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

02:58:36.401 --> 02:58:39.213
SAM: Who's good in the out of doors?

02:58:39.213 --> 02:58:40.363
TRAVIS: The outer door!

02:58:40.363 --> 02:58:42.353
MARISHA: I'm always good to go up front somewhere.

02:58:42.353 --> 02:58:43.643
TALIESIN: I'll go right behind.

02:58:43.643 --> 02:58:45.700
Keep the perception high.

02:58:45.700 --> 02:58:48.053
MATT: Caduceus and Beauregard up front. Who's behind them?

02:58:48.053 --> 02:58:49.183
TRAVIS: I'll go behind Beau.

02:58:49.183 --> 02:58:50.692
LAURA: I'll go behind Fjord.

02:58:50.692 --> 02:58:52.564
ASHLEY: I'll take the caboose.

02:58:52.564 --> 02:58:54.281
MATT: Yasha caboose.

02:58:54.281 --> 02:58:55.945
TRAVIS: Ice Man'll be the caboose!
SAM: Just stick me there anywhere.

02:58:55.945 --> 02:58:57.423
MATT: All right.

02:58:57.423 --> 02:58:59.443
TRAVIS: Vanilla Ice.
LIAM: Danger zone.

02:58:59.443 --> 02:59:02.783
MATT: So we'll have Caleb and Veth right in front of Yasha,

02:59:02.783 --> 02:59:04.193
further back?
LIAM: Sure.

02:59:04.193 --> 02:59:05.651
MATT: Okay, it's doesn't have to be single file.

02:59:05.651 --> 02:59:07.753
So I'm doing this two, two, two, one.

02:59:08.919 --> 02:59:11.499
Now you guys all begin to carefully,

02:59:11.499 --> 02:59:14.315
nimbly as you can, follow the path of the roots

02:59:14.315 --> 02:59:16.383
and the base of trees,

02:59:16.383 --> 02:59:19.993
to avoid any of the slushy, earthy ground,

02:59:19.993 --> 02:59:22.753
or the water pits themselves.

02:59:22.753 --> 02:59:24.053
And there's quite a bit of this,

02:59:24.053 --> 02:59:27.506
and you can watch, as you continue, these pools get larger,

02:59:27.506 --> 02:59:31.130
and eventually begin to completely envelop and fill

02:59:31.130 --> 02:59:32.503
the spaces between the trees,

02:59:32.503 --> 02:59:35.418
these troughs where the roots

02:59:35.418 --> 02:59:37.913
create the outer crown, or the rim,

02:59:37.913 --> 02:59:40.133
before the pool forms.

02:59:40.133 --> 02:59:42.403
And it is black, brackish, and in some cases,

02:59:42.403 --> 02:59:44.973
like a slick, oily surface.

02:59:44.973 --> 02:59:48.590
I need everyone to make a dexterity saving throw.

02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:52.548
TALIESIN: Before we enter into this,

02:59:52.548 --> 02:59:54.181
I would love to cast a spell.

02:59:54.181 --> 02:59:55.705
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: Before we all enter.

02:59:56.709 --> 03:00:00.866
I'm going to cast, if that's all right-- where are we?

03:00:01.837 --> 03:00:03.650
ASHLEY: (pulls something,
making a high-pitched zipper sound)

03:00:03.650 --> 03:00:06.236
I saw you around here somewhere.

03:00:06.236 --> 03:00:07.630
SAM: What's that sound?
MARISHA: I don't know!

03:00:07.630 --> 03:00:09.623
SAM: What a cool sound!

03:00:09.623 --> 03:00:10.487
TRAVIS: (ascending glissando)

03:00:10.487 --> 03:00:11.320
SAM: What was it?

03:00:11.320 --> 03:00:12.153
TALIESIN: I don't know what it was,

03:00:12.153 --> 03:00:13.026
but it was really cool.

03:00:13.026 --> 03:00:14.110
SAM and MARISHA: Was it you?

03:00:14.110 --> 03:00:15.576
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's me.
(laughter)

03:00:15.576 --> 03:00:17.400
TALIESIN: I thought I had it, come on.
ASHLEY: I'm just playing with--

03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:18.380
MARISHA: Can you do that with your mouth?

03:00:18.380 --> 03:00:20.537
Oh. Ah, cool.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it was me.

03:00:20.537 --> 03:00:21.718
(laughter)

03:00:21.718 --> 03:00:23.668
TRAVIS: (long scratching sound)

03:00:23.668 --> 03:00:24.503
MATT: What are you casting?

03:00:24.503 --> 03:00:26.453
TALIESIN: Apparently I got rid of it; I didn't think I did.

03:00:26.453 --> 03:00:27.533
But, nope.

03:00:27.533 --> 03:00:29.283
MATT: Well, never mind then.
TALIESIN: Never mind.

03:00:29.283 --> 03:00:30.413
TRAVIS: Dexterity saving throws?

03:00:30.413 --> 03:00:31.543
MATT: Yes, everybody.

03:00:31.543 --> 03:00:34.553
As you're all just, independently traversing the space.

03:00:36.770 --> 03:00:38.072
TRAVIS: 19.
MATT: 19.

03:00:38.072 --> 03:00:38.992
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

03:00:38.992 --> 03:00:42.233
LIAM: 17.
MATT: 17. Jester?

03:00:42.233 --> 03:00:44.322
LAURA: 16.
MATT: Veth?

03:00:44.322 --> 03:00:45.891
SAM: 24.
MATT: Yasha?

03:00:45.891 --> 03:00:47.473
ASHLEY: 17.
MATT: All right, Caduceus?

03:00:47.473 --> 03:00:48.763
TALIESIN: Four.
TRAVIS: Is he sleeping?

03:00:48.763 --> 03:00:51.163
MATT: Beauregard?
MARISHA: (chokes) 21.

03:00:51.163 --> 03:00:53.137
Sorry! Inhaled.

03:00:53.137 --> 03:00:55.523
A little bit in the wrong-- it's my spit, sorry.

03:00:55.523 --> 03:00:56.623
MATT: All right.

03:00:56.623 --> 03:00:58.653
All of you managed to, for the most part,

03:00:58.653 --> 03:01:00.003
keep it pretty solid going through.

03:01:00.003 --> 03:01:03.870
Caduceus, at one point you do step up onto

03:01:03.870 --> 03:01:05.523
one ridge of a root,

03:01:05.523 --> 03:01:06.993
and it's a bit slicker than you expect

03:01:06.993 --> 03:01:09.033
for the momentum that you're pushing forward on.

03:01:09.033 --> 03:01:11.343
And as you do, you catch yourself,

03:01:11.343 --> 03:01:14.053
but your foot can't help but (splash) beneath the surface.

03:01:14.053 --> 03:01:15.713
Roll a d6 for me.

03:01:15.713 --> 03:01:16.738
TRAVIS: Shit.

03:01:17.982 --> 03:01:20.183
TALIESIN: Six.
MATT: Six.

03:01:20.183 --> 03:01:22.400
Your foot breaks the surface (sloshing).

03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:23.842
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake.

03:01:23.842 --> 03:01:25.021
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.
MATT: (sloshing)

03:01:25.021 --> 03:01:26.048
And will not withdraw.

03:01:27.637 --> 03:01:30.047
ASHLEY: Can I try to, wait, where are you?

03:01:30.047 --> 03:01:30.913
No, you're in the front.

03:01:30.913 --> 03:01:31.866
MATT: He's in the front.

03:01:31.866 --> 03:01:33.426
TALIESIN: Got a problem.

03:01:34.487 --> 03:01:36.611
MARISHA: What'd you do?
MATT: Immediately, (suction) it begins

03:01:36.611 --> 03:01:38.646
to pull you under rapidly.
TALIESIN: I'm getting pulled, please help.

03:01:38.646 --> 03:01:39.793
MARISHA: What?
TALIESIN: Help!

03:01:39.793 --> 03:01:42.233
LAURA: Can we grab a hold of him, and try to pull?

03:01:42.233 --> 03:01:43.663
MATT: One of you can-- Well, you have to try to make

03:01:43.663 --> 03:01:45.065
a strength saving throw to pull yourself out.

03:01:45.065 --> 03:01:47.689
If you're helping, you can give him an advantage

03:01:47.689 --> 03:01:49.863
on the check.
LAURA: I will help him.

03:01:49.863 --> 03:01:51.903
MATT: Or you can both roll independently, up to you.

03:01:51.903 --> 03:01:54.468
TALIESIN: My strength sucks, so.
LAURA: I'm going to roll individually.

03:01:54.468 --> 03:01:55.714
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:01:55.714 --> 03:01:56.934
(clicks tongue)

03:01:58.617 --> 03:01:59.875
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

03:01:59.875 --> 03:02:01.193
LAURA: This is a save, or just a check?

03:02:01.193 --> 03:02:03.325
MATT: A check.

03:02:03.325 --> 03:02:05.392
LAURA: (sigh) That was real bad.

03:02:05.392 --> 03:02:06.363
(laughter)

03:02:06.363 --> 03:02:07.198
MATT: What'd you roll?

03:02:07.198 --> 03:02:08.031
LAURA: Five.

03:02:08.031 --> 03:02:10.063
MATT: Five?

03:02:10.063 --> 03:02:11.093
Caduceus.

03:02:11.093 --> 03:02:12.573
TALIESIN: I rolled a four.

03:02:12.573 --> 03:02:13.583
MATT: Okay.

03:02:13.583 --> 03:02:17.236
You grab, but Caduceus, whatever energy is now pulling him,

03:02:17.236 --> 03:02:18.823
is stronger and stronger force,

03:02:18.823 --> 03:02:21.540
and you feel, Caduceus, you other leg now,

03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:22.973
(sloshing) trying to yourself up,

03:02:22.973 --> 03:02:25.633
gets pulled in, and you're now slowly being sucked in

03:02:25.633 --> 03:02:27.683
past your knee.
LAURA: I cast Control Water!

03:02:27.683 --> 03:02:29.093
SAM: Yes!
MATT: Okay.

03:02:30.213 --> 03:02:31.553
This is not water.

03:02:31.553 --> 03:02:33.414
LAURA: Is there any water in it?

03:02:33.414 --> 03:02:36.813
MATT: It is a liquid, but it is not running, or clear water.

03:02:36.813 --> 03:02:41.663
This is a thick, tar-like substance.

03:02:41.663 --> 03:02:43.806
So I would say it would not have--

03:02:44.763 --> 03:02:46.113
at most a very minor effect.

03:02:46.113 --> 03:02:47.913
What are you attempting to do?

03:02:47.913 --> 03:02:49.601
LAURA: Like part water.

03:02:52.883 --> 03:02:55.353
MATT: Roll a wisdom check for me, just roll a d20,

03:02:55.353 --> 03:02:56.603
add your wisdom modifier.

03:02:57.893 --> 03:02:59.118
LAURA: Okay.

03:03:05.383 --> 03:03:07.673
18?
MATT: 18, okay.

03:03:07.673 --> 03:03:08.583
I will say,

03:03:10.239 --> 03:03:13.243
the liquid begins to pull part slightly,

03:03:13.243 --> 03:03:15.513
but it's too thick for you to free Caduceus.

03:03:16.983 --> 03:03:19.035
You are still finding yourself drawn in,

03:03:19.035 --> 03:03:20.533
and you guys are watching, it's draining.

03:03:20.533 --> 03:03:24.023
Like, the actual surface is draining downward.

03:03:24.023 --> 03:03:25.963
ASHLEY: Can I run up and try to grab him?

03:03:25.963 --> 03:03:27.553
MATT: You will in a moment.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:03:27.553 --> 03:03:29.080
MATT: Because the immediate action--

03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:31.243
The first attempt, on this, for him to escape,

03:03:31.243 --> 03:03:32.753
has already transpired.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:03:32.753 --> 03:03:34.103
MATT: As it's funneling in and it separates,

03:03:34.103 --> 03:03:37.093
you now see the source of this,

03:03:37.093 --> 03:03:41.923
as there is a large, multi-mandibled mouth,

03:03:41.923 --> 03:03:44.263
embedded in the ground beneath this,

03:03:44.263 --> 03:03:46.933
that apparently may have been the source

03:03:46.933 --> 03:03:48.653
of this thick, tarry excretion.

03:03:48.653 --> 03:03:50.928
LAURA: Ew!
MATT: And you watch its teeth,

03:03:50.928 --> 03:03:53.183
(chewing) clutching upward!

03:03:53.183 --> 03:03:54.956
Like, independently moving mandibles,

03:03:54.956 --> 03:03:57.503
trying to pull Caduceus's legs into its mouth.

03:03:57.503 --> 03:04:01.073
Which Caduceus, you do suffer...

03:04:01.073 --> 03:04:03.403
19 points

03:04:03.403 --> 03:04:06.146
of piercing damage as you're now beginning to be pulled

03:04:06.146 --> 03:04:07.795
into its mouth.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:04:07.795 --> 03:04:10.903
MATT: It's like a swamp antlion, just (gurgling)

03:04:10.903 --> 03:04:12.573
Pulling him in.

03:04:12.573 --> 03:04:14.363
It's horribly painful, and you're now up to your,

03:04:14.363 --> 03:04:16.103
like, upper thighs in its mouth.

03:04:16.103 --> 03:04:17.808
TALIESIN: Let me know when I have an action.

03:04:17.808 --> 03:04:19.523
MATT: You do now, and Yasha, you can run up and help, too.

03:04:19.523 --> 03:04:22.055
TALIESIN: I cast Spirit Guardians.

03:04:22.055 --> 03:04:23.915
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: (explosion)

03:04:23.915 --> 03:04:25.432
MATT: (explosion)

03:04:25.432 --> 03:04:27.922
What form of guardians arrive?

03:04:27.922 --> 03:04:31.193
TALIESIN: Oh, it's my standard, it's my--

03:04:31.193 --> 03:04:32.812
TRAVIS and MATT: Your beetles?
TALIESIN: Yep, the beetles.

03:04:32.812 --> 03:04:33.678
MATT: Okay.

03:04:33.678 --> 03:04:35.320
As you're already pulled in,

03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:37.613
you suddenly pull your hands up and release

03:04:37.613 --> 03:04:39.323
the divine energy the Wild Mother's guidance,

03:04:39.323 --> 03:04:42.553
and swirling above you, and from that (whooshing)

03:04:42.553 --> 03:04:47.453
this humming mass of angry, divine beetles

03:04:47.453 --> 03:04:49.543
begin to swarm and bite down towards this creature,

03:04:49.543 --> 03:04:51.633
they're plunging into this liquid,

03:04:51.633 --> 03:04:55.503
unscathed by it, due to their divine nature, and immaterial.

03:04:55.503 --> 03:04:59.363
Yasha, you rush up, based on the parting of this,

03:04:59.363 --> 03:05:00.473
which revealed the creature,

03:05:00.473 --> 03:05:02.143
I'll say you'll get advantage

03:05:02.143 --> 03:05:03.859
on attempting to break him free.

03:05:03.859 --> 03:05:06.170
So make a strength check for me with advantage.

03:05:06.170 --> 03:05:07.478
SAM: Come on, Yashie!

03:05:07.478 --> 03:05:08.770
LAURA: With advantage.
TALIESIN: Anyone, yeah.

03:05:08.770 --> 03:05:09.911
ASHLEY: With advantage, okay.

03:05:09.911 --> 03:05:12.121
TALIESIN: Anyone want to assist, in any way, please?

03:05:12.121 --> 03:05:13.279
ASHLEY: It's cocked.

03:05:13.279 --> 03:05:16.021
SAM: She's Yasha, she's got this.
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

03:05:17.730 --> 03:05:18.563
21.

03:05:18.563 --> 03:05:19.938
MATT: 21.

03:05:19.938 --> 03:05:23.854
As it begins to yank him into the maw,

03:05:23.854 --> 03:05:26.273
by about the waist, you rush forward and grab

03:05:26.273 --> 03:05:28.887
both of his arms, slung over the shoulder,

03:05:28.887 --> 03:05:31.963
and then run the opposite direction, yanking.

03:05:31.963 --> 03:05:34.553
You feel the teeth tearing across

03:05:34.553 --> 03:05:36.033
the outside of your armor,

03:05:36.033 --> 03:05:38.363
but you pull your legs free,

03:05:38.363 --> 03:05:39.643
and with one giant heave,

03:05:39.643 --> 03:05:43.083
you both slap onto the large root there

03:05:43.083 --> 03:05:44.303
at the base of the tree,

03:05:44.303 --> 03:05:45.673
free of any of the nearby liquid,

03:05:45.673 --> 03:05:47.463
though the lower half of Caduceus

03:05:47.463 --> 03:05:50.650
is just icky black slimed.

03:05:50.650 --> 03:05:52.593
TALIESIN: Oh, this is so gross.
ASHLEY and LAURA: Are you okay?

03:05:52.593 --> 03:05:54.725
TALIESIN: That thing did suffer
a little bit of damage, though.

03:05:54.725 --> 03:05:58.275
MATT: It did, and as it swirls, go ahead and roll damage.

03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:02.602
TALIESIN: 11 points of radiant damage.

03:06:02.602 --> 03:06:03.443
MATT: Okay.

03:06:03.443 --> 03:06:08.160
As the damage hits at you, watch the beetles swarm in,

03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:11.104
and actually shoot into the side of its open mouth.

03:06:11.104 --> 03:06:13.883
As they peer into the interior of the creature,

03:06:13.883 --> 03:06:17.683
you watch its mandibles begin roil in pain,

03:06:17.683 --> 03:06:19.824
before it begins (gurgling)

03:06:19.824 --> 03:06:21.793
to vomit up this tar-like substance,

03:06:21.793 --> 03:06:24.043
begins to bubble, bubble and fill,

03:06:24.043 --> 03:06:25.853
until eventually that little pool,

03:06:25.853 --> 03:06:30.853
now returns to it surface level before you fell in.

03:06:31.363 --> 03:06:33.213
ASHLEY: Okay, so we definitely don't want to--

03:06:34.073 --> 03:06:35.295
TALIESIN: I don't like that.

03:06:35.295 --> 03:06:36.944
TRAVIS: Don't touch the lava!

03:06:36.944 --> 03:06:39.033
SAM: (laughs)

03:06:39.033 --> 03:06:41.443
LAURA: If we had Walk on Water,

03:06:41.443 --> 03:06:43.313
would that work on this shit?

03:06:43.313 --> 03:06:44.243
TRAVIS: It's not water.

03:06:44.243 --> 03:06:45.533
LAURA: I know, but!

03:06:45.533 --> 03:06:47.033
It's liquid, isn't it?

03:06:47.033 --> 03:06:48.343
TRAVIS: It's not Walk on Liquid, though.

03:06:48.343 --> 03:06:49.551
MATT: You don't know.

03:06:50.726 --> 03:06:51.784
LAURA: (scoffs)

03:06:51.784 --> 03:06:54.933
SAM: Want me to try with my ring?
TRAVIS: No, no, no, nope.

03:06:54.933 --> 03:06:56.253
MATT: You do have a ring that allows you to do that,

03:06:56.253 --> 03:06:57.433
if you want to try.

03:06:57.433 --> 03:06:58.333
LAURA: Oh.

03:06:58.333 --> 03:07:00.043
TRAVIS: Don't, don't you do that!
TALIESIN: No!

03:07:00.043 --> 03:07:01.123
SAM: I won't try.

03:07:01.123 --> 03:07:02.383
MATT: Sure.

03:07:02.383 --> 03:07:03.675
SAM: I'm okay.
MATT: Okay.

03:07:03.675 --> 03:07:06.004
TRAVIS: Raised eyebrows means no.

03:07:06.937 --> 03:07:09.028
SAM: Press on!

03:07:09.028 --> 03:07:11.433
MATT: Because Walk on Water says,
"walk across any liquid surface."

03:07:11.433 --> 03:07:13.747
That includes mud and things of the like.

03:07:13.747 --> 03:07:16.843
TALIESIN: Can I-- I might ask 10 minutes before we move on,

03:07:16.843 --> 03:07:19.632
just to get my bearings, if that's okay?

03:07:19.632 --> 03:07:21.035
LAURA: Sure.

03:07:21.035 --> 03:07:21.915
Take a breather.

03:07:21.915 --> 03:07:22.748
TALIESIN: I'm just going to take a breather,

03:07:22.748 --> 03:07:25.323
I'm just going to quickly heal myself.

03:07:27.756 --> 03:07:29.533
Casting healing myself, I don't get the bonus

03:07:29.533 --> 03:07:32.153
from the, it's only when I take a short rest

03:07:32.153 --> 03:07:34.694
that I get the bonus from the necklace right?

03:07:34.694 --> 03:07:35.527
MATT: For which one?

03:07:35.527 --> 03:07:37.410
TALIESIN: For the

03:07:38.849 --> 03:07:40.093
Wound Closure?

03:07:40.093 --> 03:07:42.549
MATT: I believe-- Well, how's it specified?

03:07:42.549 --> 03:07:45.143
TALIESIN: Hit die. "Whenever you roll
hit dice to regain hit points,

03:07:45.143 --> 03:07:46.283
"double the number of hit points recovered."

03:07:46.283 --> 03:07:47.741
MATT: Correct. Yeah, that's only for
if you're taking a short rest

03:07:47.741 --> 03:07:49.310
to use your hit dice to heal up.

03:07:49.310 --> 03:07:51.170
But you can do that if you want to.

03:07:51.170 --> 03:07:52.703
TALIESIN: Short rest is an awful long time.

03:07:52.703 --> 03:07:53.536
MATT: It's about an hour, yeah.

03:07:53.536 --> 03:07:54.787
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll just take the 10 minutes,

03:07:54.787 --> 03:07:56.946
and take the heal, and lose the spell.

03:07:56.946 --> 03:07:58.195
MATT: Okay, what are you casting?

03:07:59.103 --> 03:08:00.333
TALIESIN: Where'd it go?

03:08:00.333 --> 03:08:02.433
Sorry, my everything's all over the place.

03:08:04.486 --> 03:08:06.744
Prayer of Healing.

03:08:06.744 --> 03:08:10.969
Oh wait, not Prayer, what's the other 10 minute one, sorry?

03:08:20.153 --> 03:08:22.994
Why am I having issues finding this? Sorry.

03:08:22.994 --> 03:08:24.502
MATT: I'm curious--

03:08:24.502 --> 03:08:26.153
I think Prayer of Healing is the 10-minute heal

03:08:26.153 --> 03:08:28.394
that you have.
TALIESIN: For everybody, though.

03:08:28.394 --> 03:08:29.684
MATT: Correct.

03:08:29.684 --> 03:08:31.284
I don't think you have a 10 minute self-heal, do you?

03:08:31.284 --> 03:08:33.253
TALIESIN: I thought I did, maybe I don't.

03:08:33.253 --> 03:08:34.086
Okay, then I'll just do-

03:08:34.086 --> 03:08:35.153
MATT: It's been a few months, we're still getting--

03:08:35.153 --> 03:08:37.003
TALIESIN: I know. I'm trying to remember how all this works.

03:08:37.003 --> 03:08:38.173
MATT: It's all good.

03:08:38.173 --> 03:08:40.973
TALIESIN: I'll do, where'd it go?

03:08:40.973 --> 03:08:41.963
MATT: Cure Wounds is the base one.

03:08:41.963 --> 03:08:43.553
TALIESIN: Cure Wounds, as soon as I can find it.

03:08:43.553 --> 03:08:44.735
Yeah, there we are.
MATT: All right.

03:08:44.735 --> 03:08:47.530
TALIESIN: I'll do Cure Wounds at level two, is what I'll do.

03:08:47.530 --> 03:08:48.411
LIAM: You didn't prepare it?

03:08:48.411 --> 03:08:50.039
MATT: Okay.

03:08:50.039 --> 03:08:51.542
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a little--

03:08:51.542 --> 03:08:53.184
So we don't actually, that's just a six seconds,

03:08:53.184 --> 03:08:54.648
we don't need 10 minutes.

03:08:54.648 --> 03:08:55.533
MATT: Okay.

03:08:55.533 --> 03:08:57.468
So go ahead and heal yourself up.

03:08:57.468 --> 03:08:58.857
The rest of you gather yourself,

03:08:58.857 --> 03:09:00.698
the owl (fluttering)

03:09:00.698 --> 03:09:02.041
lands in the branch right above,

03:09:02.041 --> 03:09:03.571
and (hooting).

03:09:03.571 --> 03:09:05.294
MARISHA: All right, just give us a moment.

03:09:05.294 --> 03:09:07.143
LAURA: (hooting)
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:09:07.143 --> 03:09:08.717
SAM: Jesus!

03:09:08.717 --> 03:09:10.959
LIAM: Yeah, this is terrible.
LAURA: That was crazy!

03:09:10.959 --> 03:09:13.823
LIAM: Caleb uses his transmuter's ability,

03:09:13.823 --> 03:09:17.083
and I get my little free Polymorph,
and I turn into a giant owl

03:09:17.083 --> 03:09:19.393
and join our guide on the branch.
MATT: (swooshing)

03:09:19.393 --> 03:09:22.251
Up onto the branch.
MARISHA: Yeah, I was actually going to-- yeah.

03:09:22.251 --> 03:09:26.463
I'm super down for a hike, into jungle treks,

03:09:26.463 --> 03:09:28.913
but is there a way we could speed this up?

03:09:28.913 --> 03:09:30.885
Could we?

03:09:30.885 --> 03:09:33.918
LAURA: Don't know if between the two of us,

03:09:33.918 --> 03:09:35.582
if we could carry everyone.

03:09:35.582 --> 03:09:37.574
SAM: (hooting)

03:09:37.574 --> 03:09:38.843
LAURA: As a giant owl, we can carry,

03:09:38.843 --> 03:09:41.327
like, two people each, probably?

03:09:41.327 --> 03:09:43.623
MATT: As a giant owl?
LAURA: I think that's what we did before.

03:09:43.623 --> 03:09:46.233
MATT: I'm pretty sure--
LAURA: One in each claw.

03:09:46.233 --> 03:09:47.066
MATT: Yeah.

03:09:48.873 --> 03:09:49.903
MATT: I'd say so.

03:09:49.903 --> 03:09:53.623
MARISHA: Is Viridian a giant owl, or just a regular owl?

03:09:53.623 --> 03:09:58.336
MATT: Just an owl.
TRAVIS: You're going to have one odd person out.

03:09:58.336 --> 03:10:01.163
MATT: Correct, yeah, you can carry at most two people

03:10:01.163 --> 03:10:03.963
of standard size as a giant owl, yeah.

03:10:03.963 --> 03:10:04.796
LAURA: Okay.

03:10:04.796 --> 03:10:07.913
MARISHA: Viridian, do you have, like, a bigger owl variety?

03:10:07.913 --> 03:10:09.293
Kind of like what he's doing?

03:10:09.293 --> 03:10:10.693
Can you do that, too?

03:10:10.693 --> 03:10:13.643
You know, so we can, like, (clicks tongue) just?

03:10:13.643 --> 03:10:17.043
MATT: The owl (noises).

03:10:17.043 --> 03:10:19.133
The head rotates back and forth as a no.

03:10:19.133 --> 03:10:21.393
TRAVIS: Let's hoof it, this is a beautiful place!

03:10:21.393 --> 03:10:22.453
SAM: Yeah!
TRAVIS: I'm excited!

03:10:22.453 --> 03:10:24.413
SAM: Just avoid the pools!

03:10:24.413 --> 03:10:25.743
TRAVIS: I start walking.

03:10:25.743 --> 03:10:30.403
SAM: Yeah, I'll join Fjord up at the top, the front!

03:10:30.403 --> 03:10:32.783
The greens are in charge!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:10:32.783 --> 03:10:33.866
SAM: Oh wait, I'm not green anymore.

03:10:33.866 --> 03:10:34.790
MATT: Now at the front.

03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:38.327
(laughter)

03:10:38.327 --> 03:10:39.555
TRAVIS: You'll always be green to me.

03:10:39.555 --> 03:10:42.820
MATT: All right, and we have Caleb as an owl.

03:10:42.820 --> 03:10:44.870
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to,

03:10:46.081 --> 03:10:47.104
well,

03:10:47.104 --> 03:10:48.729
it only lasts 10 minutes.

03:10:50.225 --> 03:10:51.442
ASHLEY and LIAM: (hooting)

03:10:53.653 --> 03:10:57.723
LAURA: I'm going to use my charge, on my thingy.

03:10:57.723 --> 03:10:58.587
MATT: Okay.

03:10:58.587 --> 03:11:02.084
LAURA: Charm of Plant Command.

03:11:02.084 --> 03:11:05.893
And I'm going to talk to the plants.

03:11:05.893 --> 03:11:08.192
MATT: All right.
LAURA: I'm going to say:

03:11:08.192 --> 03:11:10.683
Hey, you trees!

03:11:10.683 --> 03:11:14.413
Can you guys, you know, move some branches

03:11:14.413 --> 03:11:18.210
to make it easier for us to not step in this tar stuff?

03:11:18.210 --> 03:11:19.413
That'd be really great.

03:11:19.413 --> 03:11:22.015
We're just trying to get over there!

03:11:23.563 --> 03:11:25.613
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check.

03:11:25.613 --> 03:11:27.886
LAURA: But it's a command.

03:11:27.886 --> 03:11:30.413
It's just, you can plants.

03:11:30.413 --> 03:11:31.543
TALIESIN: No.

03:11:31.543 --> 03:11:34.442
I think you can charm, like, you have to still ask.

03:11:34.442 --> 03:11:35.508
LAURA: Oh, I do?

03:11:35.508 --> 03:11:36.658
TALIESIN: But you have advantage.

03:11:37.885 --> 03:11:39.135
And they can talk back.

03:11:40.539 --> 03:11:43.148
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Can they be sassy?

03:11:43.148 --> 03:11:44.874
MATT: Depends on what you roll.

03:11:44.874 --> 03:11:46.408
LAURA: What am I rolling?

03:11:46.408 --> 03:11:47.828
Persuasion with advantage?

03:11:47.828 --> 03:11:50.613
MATT: You're trying to convince the local trees

03:11:50.613 --> 03:11:52.383
to give you passage.
TRAVIS: "Trees."

03:11:52.383 --> 03:11:53.703
MARISHA: The local trees?

03:11:53.703 --> 03:11:54.536
LAURA: With advantage?

03:11:54.536 --> 03:11:55.564
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: Okay.

03:11:57.073 --> 03:11:59.103
SAM: Hey, local trees!

03:11:59.103 --> 03:12:00.463
LAURA: Guidance, can I do that?

03:12:00.463 --> 03:12:02.677
No, I can't, because I'm already casting other stuff.

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:03.590
Fuck!

03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:05.306
ASHLEY: Guidance!

03:12:05.306 --> 03:12:06.629
SAM: Like your yarmulke guidance.

03:12:06.629 --> 03:12:08.674
TALIESIN: Next time, I'll do the Guidance.

03:12:08.674 --> 03:12:09.507
LAURA: 15?

03:12:10.449 --> 03:12:12.058
MATT: 15, okay.

03:12:13.213 --> 03:12:15.853
MATT: The trees, the ones that are local to you.

03:12:15.853 --> 03:12:18.160
SAM: The local ones.

03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:19.193
MATT: In the immediate presence go.

03:12:19.193 --> 03:12:21.860
TALIESIN: Have you talked to your local tree today?

03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:23.429
MARISHA: It's good to know your local tree.
MATT: "Uh.

03:12:23.429 --> 03:12:27.303
"Not much I can do as a tree, but I'll try."

03:12:27.303 --> 03:12:28.413
And one of the ones next to it, goes like,

03:12:28.413 --> 03:12:30.363
"Yeah, I'll help out."

03:12:30.363 --> 03:12:32.088
LAURA: Yeah, it says the spell doesn't enable

03:12:32.088 --> 03:12:33.883
plants to uproot themselves and move about,

03:12:33.883 --> 03:12:37.373
but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

03:12:37.373 --> 03:12:38.381
MATT: Yeah.

03:12:38.381 --> 03:12:39.889
So some of the branches that are

03:12:39.889 --> 03:12:43.843
about 10 or so feet above you, begin to shift a bit,

03:12:43.843 --> 03:12:45.913
to open up.

03:12:45.913 --> 03:12:47.703
LAURA: To help us, like, maybe we can grab onto them,

03:12:47.703 --> 03:12:50.123
and make it easier to walk?

03:12:50.123 --> 03:12:51.943
MATT: Do you want to try to climb up through the trees?

03:12:51.943 --> 03:12:54.463
LAURA: No, so we can hold onto the lower branches,

03:12:54.463 --> 03:12:56.313
and, like, that way we can have something to hold onto.

03:12:56.313 --> 03:12:57.488
MATT: Okay, yeah. All right, yeah.

03:12:57.488 --> 03:12:58.571
So some of the branches, I would say,

03:12:58.571 --> 03:13:00.542
will come down a bit, and angle in a direction

03:13:00.542 --> 03:13:01.975
that'll give you more of a handhold.

03:13:01.975 --> 03:13:03.908
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: Cool.

03:13:03.908 --> 03:13:05.041
TALIESIN: Very nice.
MARISHA: As Keyleth,

03:13:05.041 --> 03:13:06.224
I don't think I ever had

03:13:06.224 --> 03:13:08.833
a conversation with plants that successful.

03:13:08.833 --> 03:13:11.650
They were fucking dicks to me, all the way through.

03:13:11.650 --> 03:13:12.534
TRAVIS: Sun Tree was pretty cool.

03:13:12.534 --> 03:13:14.643
MARISHA: Sun Tree was fine, Sun Tree was the best.

03:13:14.643 --> 03:13:17.073
All the other ones were like, "I'm a plant, I don't."

03:13:17.073 --> 03:13:19.633
MATT: Well no, you completely averted an entire encounter

03:13:19.633 --> 03:13:21.453
with plant-based monsters--
LAURA: That's true!

03:13:21.453 --> 03:13:24.001
MATT: -- by telling it to just go away, and it went, "Okay."

03:13:24.001 --> 03:13:25.703
MARISHA: Well, that was a good moment.

03:13:25.703 --> 03:13:27.093
TRAVIS: Selective memory!

03:13:27.093 --> 03:13:28.450
(laughter)

03:13:28.450 --> 03:13:31.073
MATT: The down side is--
MARISHA: The island, I don't know man!

03:13:31.073 --> 03:13:33.663
MATT: You have a lot of forest to traverse.

03:13:33.663 --> 03:13:34.496
LAURA: I know.

03:13:34.496 --> 03:13:35.853
MATT: And you only really conversed

03:13:35.853 --> 03:13:37.981
with the trees in that vicinity.

03:13:39.713 --> 03:13:41.753
So what I'll do is, because you guys

03:13:41.753 --> 03:13:42.693
for the next leg of this journey,

03:13:42.693 --> 03:13:44.623
you all have to make another dexterity saving throw.

03:13:44.623 --> 03:13:45.994
SAM: Right.
MARISHA: Shit.

03:13:45.994 --> 03:13:48.609
MATT: I'll say because of your aid,

03:13:48.609 --> 03:13:50.613
I'm adjusting the DC accordingly.

03:13:50.613 --> 03:13:51.618
LAURA: Okay.

03:13:54.878 --> 03:13:56.143
ASHLEY: I got advantage.

03:13:56.143 --> 03:13:58.224
LAURA: So we should roll? We should roll right now?

03:13:58.224 --> 03:14:01.210
MATT: Yes, everyone should roll a dexterity saving throw.

03:14:01.210 --> 03:14:02.043
MARISHA: 15.
TALIESIN: Oh, come on.

03:14:02.043 --> 03:14:02.960
MATT: 15, okay.

03:14:04.585 --> 03:14:06.001
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

03:14:06.001 --> 03:14:07.443
(laughter)

03:14:07.443 --> 03:14:08.276
MATT: Caduceus?

03:14:08.276 --> 03:14:09.109
SAM: You got big feet!

03:14:09.109 --> 03:14:10.463
TALIESIN: Six. Again.
MATT: Six?

03:14:10.463 --> 03:14:11.729
MATT: Yasha?
ASHLEY: 22.

03:14:11.729 --> 03:14:12.562
MATT: 22?

03:14:12.562 --> 03:14:14.803
SAM: 11.
MATT: 11, wow.

03:14:14.803 --> 03:14:16.403
LIAM: Do I skip this as an owl?
SAM: Great, great.

03:14:16.403 --> 03:14:17.733
MATT: Yes, you don't have to worry as an owl.

03:14:17.733 --> 03:14:19.233
LAURA: 15.
MATT: 15, okay, Fjord?

03:14:19.233 --> 03:14:20.593
TRAVIS: Six.

03:14:20.593 --> 03:14:22.663
MATT: Six?
SAM: Oh, doctor!

03:14:22.663 --> 03:14:26.359
MATT: Okay, I need both Fjord and Caduceus
to roll a d6 for me.

03:14:26.359 --> 03:14:27.192
SAM: I'm okay.

03:14:27.192 --> 03:14:28.514
LAURA: (sighs) Fuck!

03:14:28.514 --> 03:14:29.547
LIAM: Don't roll a six.

03:14:29.547 --> 03:14:31.830
TALIESIN: Four!
MATT: Okay.

03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:32.743
TRAVIS: Three.

03:14:32.743 --> 03:14:35.325
MATT: Three. Fjord.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:14:35.325 --> 03:14:37.103
MATT: As you're all making your way through,

03:14:37.103 --> 03:14:38.393
holding onto the branches for grip,

03:14:38.393 --> 03:14:40.643
the branches eventually give way,

03:14:40.643 --> 03:14:41.660
and you're having to do a little more

03:14:41.660 --> 03:14:44.673
of, like, walk, walk walk walk, leap, catch,

03:14:44.673 --> 03:14:46.253
land on the other root.

03:14:46.253 --> 03:14:49.273
Move alongside the tree trunk a bit,

03:14:49.273 --> 03:14:50.883
move along this root.

03:14:50.883 --> 03:14:52.093
See where there's a little bit of earth here,

03:14:52.093 --> 03:14:53.973
there's a heavy pull here, skirt that edge,

03:14:53.973 --> 03:14:56.338
and then leap this pull across to this root.

03:14:56.338 --> 03:14:59.973
And you go and jump onto one of the roots,

03:14:59.973 --> 03:15:01.755
and the roots crumbles beneath your weight.

03:15:01.755 --> 03:15:02.588
(crashing)

03:15:02.588 --> 03:15:04.861
And as it does, you fall down, and to catch yourself,

03:15:04.861 --> 03:15:08.233
instinctually, your front foot (splashing)

03:15:08.233 --> 03:15:10.028
right into one of these ponds.

03:15:10.028 --> 03:15:11.253
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

03:15:11.253 --> 03:15:14.123
MATT: And you, like, (gasps) pull the foot out.

03:15:14.123 --> 03:15:15.363
That was just water.

03:15:15.363 --> 03:15:16.213
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

03:15:16.213 --> 03:15:18.273
MATT: Just brackish water.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:15:18.273 --> 03:15:19.339
MATT: A little waterlogged in that boot,

03:15:19.339 --> 03:15:21.133
but beyond that, the pool just (splashing).

03:15:21.133 --> 03:15:23.204
You can now see the ripples from the impact.

03:15:23.204 --> 03:15:24.179
TRAVIS: (sighs)

03:15:24.179 --> 03:15:26.163
That could've been way worse!

03:15:26.163 --> 03:15:27.216
SAM: Yes!

03:15:27.216 --> 03:15:29.169
TRAVIS: (exclaiming) No.

03:15:29.169 --> 03:15:31.603
MATT: As you say that--
ASHLEY: [Inaudible]

03:15:31.603 --> 03:15:34.453
MATT: Caduceus is currently tightrope walking along

03:15:34.453 --> 03:15:36.831
one of the edges of one of the roots.

03:15:36.831 --> 03:15:38.589
Before he just--

03:15:38.589 --> 03:15:40.683
TALIESIN: This fucker.
MATT: (sloshing)

03:15:40.683 --> 03:15:43.063
TALIESIN: Ah!
MATT: Just slips into the tar,

03:15:43.063 --> 03:15:44.813
and this is the second familiar space,

03:15:44.813 --> 03:15:46.493
where all of a sudden you (sloshing)

03:15:46.493 --> 03:15:47.623
slip in once more.

03:15:47.623 --> 03:15:49.568
LAURA: No!
MATT: And you're stuck.

03:15:49.568 --> 03:15:52.813
TALIESIN: I immediately cast-- goddamn it, I'm going to cast

03:15:52.813 --> 03:15:56.811
Bless on myself, Bless onto you, and who else is next to me?

03:15:57.786 --> 03:16:01.431
TRAVIS: "I immediately cast Goddamn It."
MATT: You would be, it's Beau, Jester, Veth.

03:16:01.431 --> 03:16:03.303
(laughter)

03:16:03.303 --> 03:16:04.773
TALIESIN: And Bless on Jester.

03:16:04.773 --> 03:16:06.351
Help, it's again!

03:16:06.351 --> 03:16:11.351
(laughter)

03:16:11.993 --> 03:16:13.429
MATT: As Caduceus immediately (sloshing).

03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:17.113
LAURA: Oh no! I try to reach out
and grab him out of the mud.

03:16:17.113 --> 03:16:18.750
MATT: Okay.

03:16:18.750 --> 03:16:21.633
All right, so you're both trying to get to him.

03:16:21.633 --> 03:16:23.143
MARISHA: "Help, it's again!" (laughter)

03:16:23.143 --> 03:16:26.177
TALIESIN: Do I get my initial pull out one more time?

03:16:26.177 --> 03:16:27.333
(laughter)
MATT: You do.

03:16:27.333 --> 03:16:29.258
LIAM: 2020!
ASHLEY: I'm going to say that all the time now.

03:16:29.258 --> 03:16:31.377
MARISHA: Yeah! (laughs)
ASHLEY: Help, it's again.

03:16:31.377 --> 03:16:32.533
MARISHA: 2020!
(laughter)

03:16:32.533 --> 03:16:34.453
TALIESIN: Okay. It's a dex save or--?

03:16:34.453 --> 03:16:35.923
MATT: No, this is strength, strength check.

03:16:35.923 --> 03:16:36.812
TALIESIN: Strength check.

03:16:36.812 --> 03:16:38.120
LAURA: 15.
MARISHA: I just want it on a shirt!

03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:39.573
MATT: 15?
LAURA: 15.

03:16:39.573 --> 03:16:42.663
TRAVIS: Help, it's again!

03:16:42.663 --> 03:16:43.496
ASHLEY: You just gave up.

03:16:43.496 --> 03:16:45.910
TALIESIN: No bonus for me here.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:47.384
(exclaiming)

03:16:47.384 --> 03:16:48.949
TALIESIN: No.

03:16:48.949 --> 03:16:49.882
SAM: Oh, poor Taliesin.

03:16:49.882 --> 03:16:51.723
MATT: Jester, as you're, pulling and pulling

03:16:51.723 --> 03:16:54.772
he's still being dragged down into the muck beneath,

03:16:54.772 --> 03:16:56.903
you did not part the water here,

03:16:56.903 --> 03:16:58.823
so you do not know what's beneath there visually,

03:16:58.823 --> 03:17:00.183
but you know what's beneath there.

03:17:00.183 --> 03:17:02.035
And you watch as Caduceus,

03:17:02.035 --> 03:17:04.333
the pain begins to set in as the crushing, and biting,

03:17:04.333 --> 03:17:05.385
begins to hit.
TALIESIN: Ow!

03:17:05.385 --> 03:17:06.350
SAM: Hello, McFarlane?

03:17:06.350 --> 03:17:08.072
Start working on the next one.

03:17:08.072 --> 03:17:09.262
(laughter)

03:17:09.262 --> 03:17:10.403
TALIESIN: Not funny. Not funny.

03:17:10.403 --> 03:17:13.039
(laughter)

03:17:13.039 --> 03:17:13.966
I thought it was a save!

03:17:13.966 --> 03:17:17.117
MATT: You take 11 points of piercing damage.

03:17:17.117 --> 03:17:18.363
ASHLEY: Oh no!

03:17:18.363 --> 03:17:20.648
MATT: As you are being pulled into the creature's mouth.
ASHLEY: Can I?

03:17:20.648 --> 03:17:22.489
Can we try the?
MATT: You can go ahead and try again.

03:17:22.489 --> 03:17:23.322
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

03:17:23.322 --> 03:17:25.893
MATT: So now Yasha and Jester, you can both make checks.

03:17:25.893 --> 03:17:28.963
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Instead of Caduceus making his own check.

03:17:28.963 --> 03:17:31.843
Since you are both now to him.
ASHLEY: Seven-- sorry, 18.

03:17:31.843 --> 03:17:32.733
MATT: 18?

03:17:32.733 --> 03:17:34.633
LAURA: Mine's less than my first time.

03:17:34.633 --> 03:17:35.503
MATT: Okay.

03:17:35.503 --> 03:17:36.383
Between the two of you,

03:17:36.383 --> 03:17:38.833
Yasha mainly being the savior in this point,

03:17:38.833 --> 03:17:40.278
but between the two of you,

03:17:40.278 --> 03:17:42.263
you each grab an arm, and (grunting)

03:17:42.263 --> 03:17:44.432
yank Caduceus out a second time.

03:17:44.432 --> 03:17:48.943
You don't quite fall as deep into this one quagmire,

03:17:49.868 --> 03:17:52.623
but the frustration's definitely filled in.

03:17:52.623 --> 03:17:53.664
TALIESIN: I'm not built for this.

03:17:53.664 --> 03:17:54.773
(laughter)

03:17:54.773 --> 03:17:55.763
I was not built for this.

03:17:55.763 --> 03:17:57.917
LIAM: Well, that's the other foot gone.

03:17:57.917 --> 03:17:59.223
TRAVIS: Help, it's again!

03:17:59.223 --> 03:18:01.043
TALIESIN: This is first time I've been in nature

03:18:01.043 --> 03:18:03.101
and gone, "This is gross."

03:18:03.101 --> 03:18:04.417
SAM: Oh no!
ASHLEY: No!

03:18:04.417 --> 03:18:06.179
TALIESIN: This is just, it's in my boots.

03:18:06.179 --> 03:18:07.012
ASHLEY: Oh no!

03:18:07.012 --> 03:18:08.920
MARISHA: It's in my boots!
TALIESIN: It's just in my boots,

03:18:08.920 --> 03:18:10.678
and I can smell it.

03:18:10.678 --> 03:18:13.223
LAURA: How much damage did you take, Caduceus?

03:18:13.223 --> 03:18:16.084
TALIESIN: I am 12 points of damage down.

03:18:16.084 --> 03:18:18.686
LAURA: I don't know if I have any healing spells prepared!

03:18:18.686 --> 03:18:19.813
SAM: Of course not!

03:18:19.813 --> 03:18:22.193
TALIESIN: I'm--
LAURA: Oh wait!

03:18:23.743 --> 03:18:25.213
I have Healing Word!

03:18:25.213 --> 03:18:26.987
TALIESIN: That, I mean.

03:18:26.987 --> 03:18:28.903
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to cast Healing Word on him.

03:18:28.903 --> 03:18:30.285
TRAVIS: Oh my god!
MATT: Okay.

03:18:30.285 --> 03:18:31.988
(laughter)

03:18:31.988 --> 03:18:33.930
LAURA: Get better!

03:18:33.930 --> 03:18:35.671
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:18:35.671 --> 03:18:37.423
ASHLEY: Help, it's again.

03:18:37.423 --> 03:18:39.755
MARISHA: The Mylar ballon of spells.

03:18:39.755 --> 03:18:42.005
(laughter)

03:18:42.990 --> 03:18:43.898
LAURA: Eight points!

03:18:43.898 --> 03:18:45.565
TALIESIN: Thank you.
SAM: Hey, that's pretty good!

03:18:45.565 --> 03:18:47.543
ASHLEY: Yay, look at that!

03:18:47.543 --> 03:18:48.993
TALIESIN: I'm over-- I'm triple digits again,

03:18:48.993 --> 03:18:51.224
that's all I really want.

03:18:51.224 --> 03:18:52.473
My boots are disgusting.

03:18:52.473 --> 03:18:54.153
LIAM: Triple digits, wow.

03:18:54.153 --> 03:18:55.613
LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:55.613 --> 03:18:57.343
TALIESIN: Live that dream!

03:18:57.343 --> 03:18:59.981
LAURA: Maybe-- Hey, maybe Caleb?

03:18:59.981 --> 03:19:00.833
LIAM: (hooting)

03:19:00.833 --> 03:19:03.873
LAURA: Maybe you should just pick up Caduceus?

03:19:03.873 --> 03:19:06.828
You can carry at least--
SAM: Yeah, it's true.

03:19:06.828 --> 03:19:08.343
LIAM: (whooshing)

03:19:08.343 --> 03:19:11.473
TALIESIN: I would've commented on some humility issues here,

03:19:11.473 --> 03:19:14.266
but that's gone now after the second one.

03:19:14.266 --> 03:19:15.550
I just don't want that to happen again.

03:19:15.550 --> 03:19:16.850
LIAM: Caleb is starting to pull him up.

03:19:16.850 --> 03:19:18.168
MATT: Yeah, Caduceus stands there,

03:19:18.168 --> 03:19:19.373
his shoulder slump for a minute,

03:19:19.373 --> 03:19:21.993
before the giant owl just picks him up

03:19:21.993 --> 03:19:23.623
and lifts him out.

03:19:23.623 --> 03:19:24.885
TALIESIN: I'm letting it happen.

03:19:24.885 --> 03:19:26.845
MATT: Much like Atreyu out of the Swamp of Sadness.

03:19:26.845 --> 03:19:28.836
(dripping) from below.

03:19:28.836 --> 03:19:29.873
LIAM: Not even with dignity,

03:19:29.873 --> 03:19:31.153
not the shoulders.
TALIESIN: No.

03:19:31.153 --> 03:19:32.703
LIAM: I'm taking him sideways.

03:19:32.703 --> 03:19:34.925
(laughter)

03:19:34.925 --> 03:19:36.803
TALIESIN: The wrong side of the flop hair,

03:19:36.803 --> 03:19:41.049
so it's all in my face.
(laughter)

03:19:41.049 --> 03:19:43.263
ASHLEY: I love it so much.

03:19:43.263 --> 03:19:44.948
TALIESIN: I give up.
MATT: All righty.

03:19:46.253 --> 03:19:49.713
You continue on for another hour or so,

03:19:49.713 --> 03:19:51.933
carefully making your way through.

03:19:51.933 --> 03:19:53.064
SAM: ♪ Making my way ♪

03:19:53.064 --> 03:19:54.606
MARISHA: (vocalizing)

03:19:58.074 --> 03:19:59.532
MATT: The temperature

03:20:03.733 --> 03:20:06.646
begins to grow colder and colder still,

03:20:06.646 --> 03:20:09.253
to the point where you begin to be able to see

03:20:09.253 --> 03:20:11.121
your breath visibly in the air,

03:20:11.121 --> 03:20:12.983
which seems very uncharacteristic,

03:20:12.983 --> 03:20:14.633
based on the location of this island.

03:20:14.633 --> 03:20:17.358
LAURA: The Shaded Tangle!

03:20:17.358 --> 03:20:19.841
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, cold and gray!

03:20:25.793 --> 03:20:26.983
MATT: You also begin to notice,

03:20:26.983 --> 03:20:31.207
particularly Cad-- well no, you're
in the middle of (wings flapping)

03:20:31.207 --> 03:20:33.093
You don't notice anything.

03:20:33.093 --> 03:20:35.668
Beauregard and Caleb,

03:20:36.933 --> 03:20:38.703
though in your owl form, what's your passive perception?

03:20:38.703 --> 03:20:40.633
LIAM: Yeah, it's-- I don't know what passive perception is,

03:20:40.633 --> 03:20:42.813
but the wisdom is just a plus one, it's probably not strong.

03:20:42.813 --> 03:20:44.633
MATT: Okay, no, so it would be--

03:20:45.825 --> 03:20:47.193
It would be Beauregard.

03:20:47.193 --> 03:20:48.462
MARISHA: Okay.

03:20:48.462 --> 03:20:52.988
MATT: You also notice the sound of any local birds,

03:20:52.988 --> 03:20:56.523
bugs, gone. It is silent.

03:20:56.523 --> 03:20:57.803
It is still.

03:20:57.803 --> 03:21:01.403
MARISHA: Like, noticeably, like one side was like, woo,

03:21:01.403 --> 03:21:04.223
I can hear some birds, and then a quick--

03:21:04.223 --> 03:21:05.139
MATT: Kind of like as you're walking,

03:21:05.139 --> 03:21:06.555
you notice your breath and the cold,

03:21:06.555 --> 03:21:07.853
some of you also stop for a second,

03:21:07.853 --> 03:21:09.693
and listen around in this, the first time you realize

03:21:09.693 --> 03:21:13.193
that there is no other noise in the area.

03:21:13.193 --> 03:21:16.613
The colors, the plant life around you

03:21:16.613 --> 03:21:18.403
has become steadily more and more muted

03:21:18.403 --> 03:21:20.743
and unsaturated as you continue.

03:21:20.743 --> 03:21:22.383
The greens have become grays.

03:21:22.383 --> 03:21:26.013
It's like everything went partway to monochrome.

03:21:26.013 --> 03:21:28.327
MARISHA: Does it remind us of-
ASHLEY: You guys! You see me?

03:21:28.327 --> 03:21:30.793
(laughter)

03:21:30.793 --> 03:21:31.683
SAM: Camouflage!

03:21:31.683 --> 03:21:33.473
LIAM: Actually, DM, if it plays in later,

03:21:33.473 --> 03:21:35.630
I have keen hearing and sight, advantage

03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:37.710
on perception checks.
MATT: Okay.

03:21:37.710 --> 03:21:39.076
LIAM: If it matters later.

03:21:40.342 --> 03:21:41.913
MATT: Not at this moment, necessarily, but--

03:21:41.913 --> 03:21:45.075
MARISHA: On that note, does it remind us Xhorhas?

03:21:45.075 --> 03:21:46.467
Does it look like Xhorhas?

03:21:48.183 --> 03:21:51.293
MATT: No, it's too--

03:21:53.123 --> 03:21:55.013
it doesn't resemble the wastes necessarily,

03:21:55.013 --> 03:21:56.673
the temperature, the loss of color,

03:21:56.673 --> 03:21:59.463
it feels supernatural, as opposed to just

03:21:59.463 --> 03:22:02.623
a barren location, if that makes any sense.

03:22:02.623 --> 03:22:04.243
TRAVIS: What the fuck is this, man?

03:22:04.243 --> 03:22:07.053
MARISHA: Weird, like someone put a
black and white filter over it?

03:22:07.053 --> 03:22:09.635
LIAM: Instagram filter?
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:22:09.635 --> 03:22:12.723
MATT: Between the black pools, the trees themselves,

03:22:12.723 --> 03:22:14.853
their bark turning more and more gray,

03:22:14.853 --> 03:22:17.863
the plant life that does exist around here itself

03:22:17.863 --> 03:22:19.703
becoming a little less spiked with color,

03:22:19.703 --> 03:22:21.053
becoming more and more to, like,

03:22:21.053 --> 03:22:23.619
muted, very dark greens

03:22:23.619 --> 03:22:27.453
to black coloration at times.

03:22:27.453 --> 03:22:28.993
The landscape itself just seems

03:22:28.993 --> 03:22:31.203
to progressively become more and more

03:22:31.203 --> 03:22:33.335
of a monochromatic scheme.

03:22:34.223 --> 03:22:35.056
LAURA: Does it--

03:22:36.732 --> 03:22:41.732
Does it look like the same plant life?

03:22:41.783 --> 03:22:43.273
The color of it has just changed?

03:22:43.273 --> 03:22:45.155
Or does it look like a different type of plant?

03:22:45.155 --> 03:22:46.153
MATT: It looks similar,

03:22:46.153 --> 03:22:48.435
though a lot of looks a lot less healthy.

03:22:48.435 --> 03:22:51.273
A little more withered, hanging.

03:22:51.273 --> 03:22:53.003
Even the moss itself seems a bit

03:22:53.003 --> 03:22:54.753
dried and cracked in places,

03:22:54.753 --> 03:22:59.053
which is strange for it being so moist in the vicinity.

03:22:59.053 --> 03:23:00.473
MARISHA: Still thick forest?

03:23:00.473 --> 03:23:02.663
MATT: Still thick forest, but just--

03:23:02.663 --> 03:23:03.523
TALIESIN: Unhealthy.

03:23:03.523 --> 03:23:06.013
MATT: Unhealthy, and off.

03:23:06.013 --> 03:23:08.267
MARISHA: Can we see through the canopy more?

03:23:08.267 --> 03:23:10.633
MATT: You glance up, and you can see breaks in it above,

03:23:10.633 --> 03:23:15.003
but there's still a tangled mess of branches and vines

03:23:15.003 --> 03:23:17.613
and leaves up above. You can see, though, at this distance,

03:23:17.613 --> 03:23:19.283
it's hard to see what color they would in comparison

03:23:19.283 --> 03:23:20.903
to what's down here below.

03:23:22.333 --> 03:23:23.653
Occasionally you still peek through and see

03:23:23.653 --> 03:23:27.871
the blue sky above, but still pretty dense.

03:23:29.441 --> 03:23:32.893
LAURA: I'm going to use my necklace!

03:23:32.893 --> 03:23:34.460
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

03:23:34.460 --> 03:23:36.173
TALIESIN: I am so glad I gave that to you.

03:23:36.173 --> 03:23:37.073
SAM: Necklace.

03:23:37.073 --> 03:23:37.906
MATT: All righty.

03:23:37.906 --> 03:23:39.098
LAURA: I'm going to

03:23:40.263 --> 03:23:42.933
just touch one of the trees,

03:23:42.933 --> 03:23:45.533
and say: Are you guys sad?

03:23:45.533 --> 03:23:47.533
I mean, what's happening? Is this guy

03:23:47.533 --> 03:23:50.543
draining you of all your life force?

03:23:50.543 --> 03:23:54.460
What's happening here? Why do you look so drab?

03:23:56.843 --> 03:23:58.813
MATT: The tree responds with,

03:24:00.233 --> 03:24:03.768
"There's something about this land that just

03:24:05.013 --> 03:24:09.030
"is devoid of light and life.

03:24:10.793 --> 03:24:15.673
"For a long time now, myself and those around me,

03:24:15.673 --> 03:24:18.320
"just feel drained and

03:24:20.213 --> 03:24:21.513
"sallow."

03:24:23.243 --> 03:24:25.675
LAURA: Do I get to keep talking to it?

03:24:25.675 --> 03:24:27.050
MATT: Sure.

03:24:27.050 --> 03:24:29.255
LAURA: Well, how long has it been like this?

03:24:32.713 --> 03:24:34.543
MATT: "Decades."

03:24:34.543 --> 03:24:36.553
SAM: The plants have a better memory than the people.

03:24:36.553 --> 03:24:37.633
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:24:37.633 --> 03:24:38.466
TRAVIS: Maybe.

03:24:40.393 --> 03:24:42.023
LAURA: Do you know what the source is?

03:24:42.023 --> 03:24:43.773
Do you know where it's coming from?

03:24:47.093 --> 03:24:49.243
MATT: "Not since it's been like this."

03:24:50.230 --> 03:24:52.855
ASHLEY: What happened?
MATT: "It's just like this."

03:24:54.113 --> 03:24:55.873
LAURA: That sucks for you.

03:24:55.873 --> 03:24:57.123
MATT: "It does."

03:24:57.123 --> 03:24:59.790
LAURA: Can you help us get through this area,

03:24:59.790 --> 03:25:01.573
and not step in any bad things?

03:25:01.573 --> 03:25:04.153
TRAVIS: Is Jester talking to fucking tress now?

03:25:04.153 --> 03:25:07.070
SAM: I can't tell if she's talking
to the Traveler, or a tree.

03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:10.143
LAURA: Maybe we can help you!

03:25:10.143 --> 03:25:11.403
MATT: "How would you help me?"

03:25:11.403 --> 03:25:13.073
LAURA: I don't know, maybe we can get rid of the thing

03:25:13.073 --> 03:25:15.663
that's causing you to get drained of your life force?

03:25:15.663 --> 03:25:17.742
TRAVIS: What?!
MATT: "Okay."

03:25:17.742 --> 03:25:19.823
LAURA: I mean, I don't know, I'm going to try.

03:25:19.823 --> 03:25:20.793
TRAVIS: Are you helping trees, Jester?

03:25:20.793 --> 03:25:22.623
MATT: "Thank you."
LAURA: You're welcome!

03:25:22.623 --> 03:25:23.723
TALIESIN: Everyone should help trees.

03:25:23.723 --> 03:25:25.893
LAURA: Can you try to help us get through this area

03:25:25.893 --> 03:25:27.588
without stepping in water?
SAM: What'd you say, Caduceus?

03:25:27.588 --> 03:25:29.123
MATT: "I don't know how."
LIAM: (flapping)

03:25:29.123 --> 03:25:31.273
LAURA: Oh, you can, like, lower your branches down.

03:25:31.273 --> 03:25:32.988
MATT: The branches lower a little bit.

03:25:32.988 --> 03:25:34.873
LAURA: Thanks! Just spread the word around,

03:25:34.873 --> 03:25:37.084
to lower branches.

03:25:37.084 --> 03:25:38.026
Thanks!

03:25:39.123 --> 03:25:39.956
MATT: Okay.

03:25:41.085 --> 03:25:42.593
TRAVIS: Are you talking to the trees now?

03:25:42.593 --> 03:25:44.153
LAURA: These poor guys,

03:25:44.153 --> 03:25:46.968
they just, they feel so drab and sallow.

03:25:47.893 --> 03:25:49.513
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

03:25:49.513 --> 03:25:50.346
SAM: They also look so drab and sallow.

03:25:50.346 --> 03:25:51.511
ASHLEY: I mean, no sunlight gets--

03:25:51.511 --> 03:25:54.609
is it because there's--
SAM: Oh, I didn't see you there!

03:25:54.609 --> 03:25:58.761
(laughter)

03:25:58.761 --> 03:25:59.633
It's freaky!

03:25:59.633 --> 03:26:01.913
ASHLEY: I forgot, I blend in with the surroundings.

03:26:01.913 --> 03:26:05.193
This is great camouflage for me!

03:26:05.193 --> 03:26:07.227
I don't know what I was going to say.

03:26:07.227 --> 03:26:10.463
Is it because there's just no sun coming down here?

03:26:10.463 --> 03:26:12.173
LAURA: No, they said that it feels like

03:26:12.173 --> 03:26:14.243
something is, like, keeping them from being able

03:26:14.243 --> 03:26:17.983
to have life, like it's keeping them

03:26:17.983 --> 03:26:18.993
feeling terrible.

03:26:18.993 --> 03:26:21.143
TRAVIS: You know, just because Caduceus talks to plants,

03:26:21.143 --> 03:26:22.663
and he gave you a gift, doesn't mean you have to try

03:26:22.663 --> 03:26:25.943
and imitate him and pretend they talk back.

03:26:25.943 --> 03:26:27.613
SAM: Not to be callous, or anything,

03:26:27.613 --> 03:26:29.193
but do we really care?

03:26:29.193 --> 03:26:30.463
Come on, let's just go!

03:26:30.463 --> 03:26:33.353
LAURA: Well what if, you know.

03:26:33.353 --> 03:26:34.523
I mean, what if this--

03:26:36.463 --> 03:26:38.713
what if this Guacamole,

03:26:38.713 --> 03:26:41.343
is, like, really bad?

03:26:41.343 --> 03:26:45.323
And maybe by bringing the Traveler here,

03:26:45.323 --> 03:26:49.113
and, like, you know, all of his worshipers,

03:26:49.113 --> 03:26:54.113
maybe we can get rid of this Guacamole?

03:26:54.803 --> 03:26:56.053
TRAVIS: There's a fair chance for that,

03:26:56.053 --> 03:26:58.063
but have to figure out what it is first.

03:26:58.063 --> 03:26:58.896
LAURA: Sure.

03:27:00.153 --> 03:27:01.213
TRAVIS: Let's go!

03:27:01.213 --> 03:27:02.046
MATT: Beauregard.
MARISHA: Eh?

03:27:02.046 --> 03:27:03.263
LAURA: I'm not trying to be like Caduceus,

03:27:03.263 --> 03:27:06.634
I just, you know it's cool that I can talk to plants now!

03:27:06.634 --> 03:27:07.717
MATT: While they're having this conversation,

03:27:07.717 --> 03:27:09.453
and up in one of the higher boughs,

03:27:09.453 --> 03:27:11.343
you can see there's a regular owl,

03:27:11.343 --> 03:27:13.943
and much larger owl, who's currently one claw,

03:27:13.943 --> 03:27:15.303
clasped onto the base of the branch,

03:27:15.303 --> 03:27:17.933
the other one clutching a semi-limp Caduceus,

03:27:17.933 --> 03:27:20.713
who's just given in.

03:27:21.593 --> 03:27:26.069
But you also hear another sound.

03:27:26.069 --> 03:27:30.323
Kind of a little ways past the direction you're going,

03:27:30.323 --> 03:27:32.803
and a little further south.

03:27:32.803 --> 03:27:35.528
Sounds like a silent sobbing.

03:27:36.683 --> 03:27:39.473
ASHLEY: Creepy.
LAURA: ♪ That is fucking creepy

03:27:39.473 --> 03:27:40.663
SAM: I'm sure it's fine.

03:27:40.663 --> 03:27:42.043
MARISHA: Past the direction we're going?

03:27:42.043 --> 03:27:43.233
MATT: And a little bit to the south,

03:27:43.233 --> 03:27:46.591
just like (whimpering).

03:27:47.753 --> 03:27:49.303
MARISHA: Caduceus, are you okay, man?

03:27:49.303 --> 03:27:50.136
Is that you?

03:27:51.624 --> 03:27:53.261
TALIESIN: What? I'm-- What? What?

03:27:53.261 --> 03:27:55.823
MARISHA: No. Nope, nope.

03:27:55.823 --> 03:27:57.275
LAURA: What is it, Beau?

03:27:58.433 --> 03:28:01.058
MARISHA: You hear that, it's, like, crying.

03:28:02.557 --> 03:28:07.557
But like old man sobbing, like sad, old man sobbing.

03:28:07.853 --> 03:28:09.843
ASHLEY: I mean, is it the trees, or are you hearing--

03:28:09.843 --> 03:28:12.233
SAM: Old person crying, there's nothing sadder.

03:28:12.233 --> 03:28:14.803
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, just give me a moment.

03:28:14.803 --> 03:28:16.971
I want to move towards that direction.

03:28:16.971 --> 03:28:18.701
MATT: Okay. Stealthily?

03:28:18.701 --> 03:28:21.053
LAURA: What, are you fucking kidding me?
MARISHA: I can go pretty fast.

03:28:21.053 --> 03:28:22.083
Just hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

03:28:22.083 --> 03:28:24.308
LIAM: Are there still pools around us, by the way?

03:28:24.308 --> 03:28:25.953
MARISHA: Looking for pools.

03:28:25.953 --> 03:28:26.903
MATT: Yeah, looking for pools, all right, sure.

03:28:26.903 --> 03:28:28.769
MARISHA: Just a little bit, I'm not going to go far.

03:28:28.769 --> 03:28:30.216
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:28:30.216 --> 03:28:32.716
MARISHA: Why is it always perception?

03:28:35.013 --> 03:28:36.923
21.
MATT: 21.

03:28:36.923 --> 03:28:41.277
Okay, you deftly leap from

03:28:41.277 --> 03:28:42.873
bottom of tree trunk to tree branch,

03:28:42.873 --> 03:28:44.043
to swing off one branch,

03:28:44.043 --> 03:28:45.203
and then catch yourself.

03:28:45.203 --> 03:28:48.303
And you come to this one patch, around the pools,

03:28:48.303 --> 03:28:51.948
where you can see this trunk about

03:28:51.948 --> 03:28:53.533
eight or nine feet off the ground,

03:28:53.533 --> 03:28:56.089
that is heavily moss-covered,

03:28:56.089 --> 03:28:59.066
and has large holes in the side,

03:28:59.066 --> 03:29:02.203
and you can hear that hollow sobbing

03:29:02.203 --> 03:29:04.611
coming from that direction of that.

03:29:04.611 --> 03:29:06.340
And as soon as you stand there and look at it,

03:29:06.340 --> 03:29:07.590
the sobbing stops.

03:29:08.613 --> 03:29:10.003
And you see within this,

03:29:10.003 --> 03:29:11.903
like the darkness of this hollow in the tree,

03:29:11.903 --> 03:29:15.345
you see something reflected.

03:29:15.345 --> 03:29:16.178
Like two--
MARISHA: Eyes?

03:29:16.178 --> 03:29:18.283
MATT: -- two little points of reflection in there,

03:29:18.283 --> 03:29:19.524
just for a second.

03:29:19.524 --> 03:29:22.099
LAURA: Uh, uh, nope!

03:29:24.598 --> 03:29:25.431
MARISHA: Okay.

03:29:27.013 --> 03:29:28.273
It stops crying?

03:29:28.273 --> 03:29:30.110
MATT: Yeah.

03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:31.743
MARISHA: I take a few steps back.

03:29:33.403 --> 03:29:35.283
Anything?

03:29:35.283 --> 03:29:36.383
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

03:29:36.383 --> 03:29:40.563
MARISHA: I turn my back. Anything?

03:29:40.563 --> 03:29:41.473
MATT: Not at the moment.

03:29:41.473 --> 03:29:43.073
MARISHA: I look back real quick!

03:29:43.073 --> 03:29:44.739
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Is it still there, do I still see him?

03:29:44.739 --> 03:29:46.711
MATT: You just see the darkness in the hollow.

03:29:46.711 --> 03:29:49.111
TRAVIS: (nervous laugh)
LAURA: Reach your hand in.

03:29:49.111 --> 03:29:52.153
I was just kidding; don't do that.

03:29:53.183 --> 03:29:55.703
TALIESIN: Flash Gordon.

03:29:55.703 --> 03:29:57.703
MARISHA: I keep my eyes towards the thing,

03:29:57.703 --> 03:30:00.565
I take a few more steps back.

03:30:00.565 --> 03:30:03.065
Take out a ball bearing.
LAURA: (laughs)

03:30:03.065 --> 03:30:03.898
Throw it at the crying thing!

03:30:03.898 --> 03:30:05.493
TALIESIN: That's your solution to every problem.
MARISHA: I throw it at it.

03:30:05.493 --> 03:30:06.983
TRAVIS: Whatever you do, don't give your other teammates

03:30:06.983 --> 03:30:08.173
a chance to help out.

03:30:08.173 --> 03:30:09.856
MARISHA: I'm making my way back.

03:30:09.856 --> 03:30:12.395
(vocalizing) I make my way back

03:30:12.395 --> 03:30:14.903
while I throw it, and see what happens.

03:30:14.903 --> 03:30:16.645
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I'm being cautiously curious.

03:30:16.645 --> 03:30:19.076
MATT: Okay, you throw the ball bearing.

03:30:19.076 --> 03:30:21.473
(pinging)

03:30:21.473 --> 03:30:23.236
LAURA: You missed.
MATT: Nothing.

03:30:23.236 --> 03:30:25.058
LAURA: (laughs)

03:30:25.058 --> 03:30:26.862
MARISHA: I take a few more steps back.

03:30:26.862 --> 03:30:28.556
Can I see the owls?

03:30:28.556 --> 03:30:30.956
MATT: You can see them, yeah, you're not too far off.

03:30:32.166 --> 03:30:33.583
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

03:30:33.583 --> 03:30:36.733
MARISHA: There's a thing, there's a thing!

03:30:36.733 --> 03:30:37.566
LAURA: What thing?

03:30:37.566 --> 03:30:39.475
MARISHA: There's like a-- I don't know!

03:30:39.475 --> 03:30:40.512
I can't see him!

03:30:40.512 --> 03:30:42.093
TRAVIS: How far away are you, when you went off,

03:30:42.093 --> 03:30:43.313
and did your Miles Morales thing,

03:30:43.313 --> 03:30:44.885
I have no idea how far away you are.

03:30:44.885 --> 03:30:46.733
MARISHA: It's not far, it's just ahead!

03:30:46.733 --> 03:30:50.053
It's just ahead, there's like, I can see eyes,

03:30:50.053 --> 03:30:51.758
in the hollow of a tree!

03:30:51.758 --> 03:30:53.833
And it's sad!

03:30:53.833 --> 03:30:55.953
ASHLEY: What if we start--
MARISHA: And I don't know--

03:30:55.953 --> 03:30:59.302
ASHLEY: -- crying because maybe it wants some company.

03:30:59.302 --> 03:31:01.556
MARISHA: That's a good idea, that's a good idea!

03:31:01.556 --> 03:31:02.389
TRAVIS: God!

03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:04.058
MARISHA: I walk towards it a little bit,

03:31:04.058 --> 03:31:06.193
and I go, (sobbing)

03:31:06.193 --> 03:31:09.208
TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up!

03:31:09.208 --> 03:31:11.231
Oh my god, you're mocking it!

03:31:11.231 --> 03:31:13.693
MATT: You walk towards it and start sobbing in return?

03:31:13.693 --> 03:31:15.563
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughter)

03:31:15.563 --> 03:31:16.713
MATT: Okay.

03:31:16.713 --> 03:31:18.678
MARISHA: I liked Yasha's advice.

03:31:18.678 --> 03:31:19.878
MATT: How far are you from them,

03:31:19.878 --> 03:31:20.953
like are you trying to get them to hear you?

03:31:20.953 --> 03:31:25.330
MARISHA: Just where I was when I first saw its eyes.

03:31:25.330 --> 03:31:26.163
And it saw me.

03:31:26.163 --> 03:31:27.613
MATT: Like 30, 40 feet?

03:31:27.613 --> 03:31:28.693
MARISHA: I don't know, yeah, sure,

03:31:28.693 --> 03:31:29.663
I don't know, you didn't tell me.

03:31:29.663 --> 03:31:30.503
MATT: Right, well you didn't tell me how close

03:31:30.503 --> 03:31:31.443
you were going to get, so.

03:31:31.443 --> 03:31:33.428
How far?
MARISHA: 30 feet sounds great.

03:31:33.428 --> 03:31:35.654
MATT: All right, so you get up to the edge there,

03:31:35.654 --> 03:31:37.943
avoiding the pools.
TRAVIS: I remember Beau.

03:31:37.943 --> 03:31:40.443
MATT: And you start making like

03:31:40.443 --> 03:31:43.172
the sad, sobbing sound a little bit.

03:31:43.172 --> 03:31:46.493
MARISHA: (sobbing)

03:31:46.493 --> 03:31:48.603
MATT: You see another glimmer, of two

03:31:48.603 --> 03:31:49.893
SAM: She's alone?
MATT: -- beads in the shadow.

03:31:49.893 --> 03:31:51.726
TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Great, great, great.

03:31:52.800 --> 03:31:55.066
MARISHA: (sobbing)

03:31:55.066 --> 03:31:56.483
TRAVIS: Fucking ridiculous!

03:31:56.483 --> 03:31:58.984
MARISHA: So much to be sad about!

03:31:58.984 --> 03:32:01.234
(laughter)

03:32:02.218 --> 03:32:03.663
LIAM: It's true, though.

03:32:03.663 --> 03:32:05.646
MATT: You look back at it, after
making the [inaudible], and you look up

03:32:05.646 --> 03:32:09.263
and there's nothing in hollow, it's just dark again.

03:32:09.263 --> 03:32:10.680
No sobbing sound.

03:32:13.980 --> 03:32:17.633
MARISHA: I take out one of my, like, my pocket bacon.

03:32:17.633 --> 03:32:19.573
I get out with some pocket bacon, and I throw it,

03:32:19.573 --> 03:32:21.163
towards the front of the hollow.

03:32:21.163 --> 03:32:22.703
TRAVIS: 40 feet to the hollow?

03:32:22.703 --> 03:32:25.453
MARISHA: Yeah, 30, 30.

03:32:25.453 --> 03:32:27.119
I'm good at throwing!

03:32:27.119 --> 03:32:29.053
MATT: Look, if anybody can throw
bacon accurately, it'd be her.

03:32:29.053 --> 03:32:29.886
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:32:29.886 --> 03:32:31.398
TRAVIS: 30 feet.
SAM: (exclaiming)

03:32:31.398 --> 03:32:34.572
(laughter)

03:32:34.572 --> 03:32:36.441
MARISHA: Extra crispy, motherfucker!

03:32:36.441 --> 03:32:38.265
(laughter)

03:32:38.265 --> 03:32:40.021
MATT: All right.

03:32:40.021 --> 03:32:41.006
LIAM: It's like year-old bacon.

03:32:41.006 --> 03:32:43.283
LAURA: Yeah, it's really old fucking bacon.

03:32:43.283 --> 03:32:46.623
MATT: Just roll a d20 on you dex modifier.

03:32:46.623 --> 03:32:48.023
MARISHA: My dex mod? Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

03:32:48.023 --> 03:32:50.013
TALIESIN: Yeah, don't call anyone over to help.

03:32:50.013 --> 03:32:53.596
MARISHA: Well, I altered the owls, and you!

03:32:54.499 --> 03:32:56.173
I'm keeping sort of in contact!

03:32:56.173 --> 03:32:58.753
TALIESIN: Did we hear that?
MARISHA: 20 total.

03:32:58.753 --> 03:33:02.043
MATT: Okay, yeah, the bacon (whistles)

03:33:02.043 --> 03:33:02.876
comes to rest.

03:33:03.763 --> 03:33:05.486
LAURA: In the hole?

03:33:05.486 --> 03:33:06.740
MATT: Were you throwing it into the hole,

03:33:06.740 --> 03:33:08.581
or just on the ground in front of it?
MARISHA: In the front of it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:33:08.581 --> 03:33:10.358
MATT: It's just on the ground there.

03:33:10.358 --> 03:33:12.683
MARISHA: And I keep looking at the hole.

03:33:12.683 --> 03:33:14.792
MATT: Yeah?
MARISHA: Caduceus?

03:33:16.208 --> 03:33:17.483
Caleb!

03:33:17.483 --> 03:33:19.926
SAM: We're super far away!
LIAM: Like 100 feet away from you.

03:33:19.926 --> 03:33:22.872
(laughter)
TALIESIN: How far away are we?

03:33:22.872 --> 03:33:25.123
MATT: You did go off the beaten path to follow the sound,

03:33:25.123 --> 03:33:26.903
you're probably about 80 feet away from everyone else.

03:33:26.903 --> 03:33:29.537
LIAM: Well, I do have the Keen Hearing, so.

03:33:29.537 --> 03:33:31.463
MATT: So roll a perception check with advantage.

03:33:31.463 --> 03:33:32.453
MARISHA: Caleb!

03:33:32.453 --> 03:33:33.870
MATT: As a giant owl.

03:33:35.163 --> 03:33:36.263
LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18?

03:33:36.263 --> 03:33:39.447
You do hear Beauregard calling towards you.

03:33:39.447 --> 03:33:41.773
LIAM: (hooting)

03:33:41.773 --> 03:33:43.293
SAM: Okay! Owl's hooting!

03:33:43.293 --> 03:33:45.709
LIAM: I start flying towards the sound.

03:33:45.709 --> 03:33:47.292
TALIESIN: Ah, something happening over there.

03:33:47.292 --> 03:33:48.843
MATT: The owl of Viridian begins to follow as well,

03:33:48.843 --> 03:33:50.273
as you guys scoot down, and you're just like.

03:33:50.273 --> 03:33:52.650
TRAVIS: I guess we're going where the owls go?

03:33:52.650 --> 03:33:54.320
SAM: The owls, yeah!
LAURA: Yeah, let's follow the owls.

03:33:54.320 --> 03:33:56.606
MARISHA: I just keep looking in the hole.
TRAVIS: I feel like communication

03:33:56.606 --> 03:33:58.475
is, like, seriously lacking in this op!
SAM: Yes!

03:33:58.475 --> 03:33:59.780
MARISHA: What?! (muttering)

03:33:59.780 --> 03:34:02.213
I keep looking.
TALIESIN: Talking to trees, we're doing okay.

03:34:02.213 --> 03:34:03.571
LAURA: What's happening?
LIAM: (flapping)

03:34:03.571 --> 03:34:04.404
LAURA: What's happening over here?

03:34:04.404 --> 03:34:06.456
SAM: Hey, Beau!
MARISHA: There's a thing, there's a (shushing)

03:34:06.456 --> 03:34:07.581
MATT: You guys all approach,

03:34:07.581 --> 03:34:09.123
and cluster at Beau staring at this,

03:34:09.123 --> 03:34:12.199
this one, hollow tree in the middle of this.

03:34:12.199 --> 03:34:15.533
TRAVIS: Can we read Beau's body language and fan out a bit?

03:34:15.533 --> 03:34:18.083
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody...

03:34:18.083 --> 03:34:20.100
cry! Everybody cry!

03:34:20.100 --> 03:34:21.200
TRAVIS: What do you mean, cry?

03:34:21.200 --> 03:34:23.502
LAURA: (fake sobbing)
MARISHA: Cry, for acting like you're crying!

03:34:23.502 --> 03:34:25.198
Everybody, just follow my lead!

03:34:25.198 --> 03:34:27.120
(fake sobbing)

03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:29.223
MATT: You all start, like, sobbing loudly--

03:34:29.223 --> 03:34:30.313
TRAVIS: No, we don't!
MATT: -- in the direction--

03:34:30.313 --> 03:34:32.146
most of you start sobbing loudly--
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave

03:34:32.146 --> 03:34:33.510
in the middle of this shit.

03:34:33.510 --> 03:34:34.343
MATT: (laughs)

03:34:34.343 --> 03:34:36.788
TALIESIN: I've cried enough today.

03:34:36.788 --> 03:34:38.733
MATT: Well, as you're being held by the owl?

03:34:38.733 --> 03:34:39.743
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:34:39.743 --> 03:34:41.403
TRAVIS: Why are we crying?

03:34:41.403 --> 03:34:43.065
MARISHA: Because we're empathizing!

03:34:43.065 --> 03:34:44.407
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Empathizing with what!?

03:34:44.407 --> 03:34:45.431
MATT: Do you place Caduceus on the ground?

03:34:45.431 --> 03:34:46.397
TRAVIS: You don't know what you're doing!

03:34:46.397 --> 03:34:47.750
LIAM: Would you like that?

03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:49.053
TALIESIN: I'll probably gonna--

03:34:49.053 --> 03:34:52.324
LIAM: Sure, and I will (whoosh) into my human form

03:34:52.324 --> 03:34:53.808
on the ground.
MATT: Okay, so you return back in human form.

03:34:53.808 --> 03:34:55.213
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave on this thing.

03:34:55.213 --> 03:34:57.393
MATT: Okay, as everyone is surrounding this,

03:34:57.393 --> 03:35:01.823
this central, hollow, and some of you sobbing openly

03:35:01.823 --> 03:35:03.813
towards it.
TRAVIS: No!

03:35:03.813 --> 03:35:06.873
MATT: It still just seems dark and shadowy in that hollow.

03:35:06.873 --> 03:35:09.223
Caduceus, you go ahead, as you're focusing on this,

03:35:09.223 --> 03:35:11.453
and you concentrate on Eyes of the Grave.

03:35:11.453 --> 03:35:13.783
Nothing from the hollow.

03:35:13.783 --> 03:35:15.717
But kind of near Beau.

03:35:15.717 --> 03:35:17.073
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

03:35:17.073 --> 03:35:18.533
How near Beau?

03:35:18.533 --> 03:35:21.031
MATT: Like right where Beau is.

03:35:21.031 --> 03:35:23.010
TALIESIN: Cool, Turn Undead.

03:35:24.003 --> 03:35:25.228
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Oh.

03:35:25.228 --> 03:35:27.525
TRAVIS: What do you mean, where Beau is?

03:35:29.033 --> 03:35:30.773
LAURA: Well, what is it? What is it, though?

03:35:30.773 --> 03:35:32.653
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm just hitting a spell

03:35:32.653 --> 03:35:35.433
because something's near Beau that's slightly--

03:35:35.433 --> 03:35:36.743
MATT: What's the DC?

03:35:36.743 --> 03:35:37.863
TALIESIN: On Turn Undead?

03:35:37.863 --> 03:35:38.696
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:35:39.770 --> 03:35:42.073
TALIESIN: I can't believe I'm doing
this. Let's see how this goes.

03:35:42.073 --> 03:35:45.008
ASHLEY: (laughing) I have no idea what we're actually doing.

03:35:45.008 --> 03:35:47.553
MATT: It's a 19, so I think I might beat your DC.

03:35:47.553 --> 03:35:49.075
LAURA: Yeah.
(laughter)

03:35:49.075 --> 03:35:51.349
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's my spell DC. It's...

03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:53.018
LAURA: 17.
TALIESIN: 17.

03:35:53.018 --> 03:35:55.800
MATT: So, yeah. So you sense something there,

03:35:55.800 --> 03:35:57.333
and you immediately concentrate and (explosion)

03:35:57.333 --> 03:35:59.153
this, like, very faint wave,

03:35:59.153 --> 03:36:00.785
this rippling wave of radiant energy,

03:36:00.785 --> 03:36:03.053
comes off Caduceus in a radius.

03:36:03.053 --> 03:36:05.265
TALIESIN: And I turn. There's something behind you.
LAURA: (sobbing questioningly)

03:36:05.265 --> 03:36:06.581
MARISHA: Huh?

03:36:06.581 --> 03:36:07.833
TALIESIN: I can still see it.
SAM: (sobbing)

03:36:07.833 --> 03:36:11.253
MATT: Well, as you turn and look, Beauregard,

03:36:11.253 --> 03:36:13.790
right behind you, on the opposite end of where Caduceus is,

03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:16.360
you turn and look, right into the face--

03:36:16.360 --> 03:36:17.193
LAURA: (gasps)

03:36:17.193 --> 03:36:21.241
MATT: -- of what you see is this
hood-shrouded humanoid body.

03:36:21.241 --> 03:36:25.483
Long arms beneath this brown, tattered robe,

03:36:25.483 --> 03:36:27.935
where the eyes are, you see these

03:36:27.935 --> 03:36:30.833
black, gem-like shines in these sunken sockets.

03:36:30.833 --> 03:36:34.123
The skin itself is this dark, gray rubbery texture.

03:36:34.123 --> 03:36:35.143
There is no nose.

03:36:35.143 --> 03:36:36.940
MARISHA: Does it look like the
same sheen of eyes that I saw?

03:36:36.940 --> 03:36:38.465
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

03:36:38.465 --> 03:36:43.203
MATT: But its mouth is this large, open, dragging, gaping,

03:36:43.203 --> 03:36:45.133
black, void maw.
SAM: (groaning)

03:36:45.133 --> 03:36:46.433
MATT: Just going (inhaling)

03:36:46.433 --> 03:36:48.729
LAURA: Is there a piece of bacon stuck in it?

03:36:48.729 --> 03:36:51.433
(laughter)

03:36:51.433 --> 03:36:52.608
MATT: There is not,

03:36:54.323 --> 03:36:56.696
but we're going to come back to this--
ALL: No!

03:36:56.696 --> 03:36:58.973
(yelling)
ASHLEY: Dang it!

03:36:58.973 --> 03:37:01.265
SAM: I want to fight the bacon monster witch!

03:37:01.265 --> 03:37:02.353
MATT: I know,

03:37:02.353 --> 03:37:04.133
but it's already been, you know, three hours.

03:37:04.133 --> 03:37:05.643
just to go a little late if you view it that way.

03:37:05.643 --> 03:37:08.483
LAURA: We really should not have
fucked around quite as much!

03:37:08.483 --> 03:37:09.603
TRAVIS: No!

03:37:09.603 --> 03:37:11.365
MATT: Fucking around's what you guys do best!

03:37:11.365 --> 03:37:12.283
Are you kidding me?

03:37:12.283 --> 03:37:15.332
♪ I talk to the trees ♪
(laughter)

03:37:15.332 --> 03:37:18.479
♪ They have listened to me ♪

03:37:18.479 --> 03:37:19.887
LAURA: Oh my god, what the fuck

03:37:19.887 --> 03:37:20.844
is this creepy thing?
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

03:37:20.844 --> 03:37:21.677
MARISHA: I don't know!

03:37:21.677 --> 03:37:24.035
I thought maybe if it was, like, a sad ghost,

03:37:24.035 --> 03:37:26.003
you know, like a Moaning Myrtle situation?

03:37:26.003 --> 03:37:26.836
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah!

03:37:26.836 --> 03:37:27.669
MARISHA: Maybe we could--

03:37:27.669 --> 03:37:29.860
LAURA: I feel like it was-- wait, wait!

03:37:29.860 --> 03:37:31.313
Wasn't there some other creepy creature

03:37:31.313 --> 03:37:35.043
that was crying before that we-- in the wastes?

03:37:35.043 --> 03:37:37.363
MARISHA: Well, the hollows.

03:37:37.363 --> 03:37:39.498
MATT: Yeah, it was a moaning thing.

03:37:39.498 --> 03:37:40.503
MARISHA: Is that the same?
LAURA: That was also creepy!

03:37:40.503 --> 03:37:42.783
MARISHA: Is it as familiar as that?
ASHLEY: That was very creepy!

03:37:42.783 --> 03:37:45.053
TALIESIN: I've already burned a Turn Undead on this thing!

03:37:45.053 --> 03:37:47.105
MATT: It looks different.
ASHLEY: Where the big tree was!

03:37:47.105 --> 03:37:48.883
MATT: This looks humanoid,

03:37:48.883 --> 03:37:52.365
but its limbs are very long and stretched.

03:37:52.365 --> 03:37:54.273
Like I said, it has that hood, and the mouth is

03:37:54.273 --> 03:37:57.373
very-- this elongated, dragging jaw.

03:37:57.373 --> 03:37:58.503
TRAVIS: Nope!
LAURA: No, no.

03:37:58.503 --> 03:38:00.963
TALIESIN: Oh, also Eyes is 60 feet, so if there is anything

03:38:00.963 --> 03:38:02.296
even on the periphery of that.

03:38:02.296 --> 03:38:03.729
It's a 60 foot circle.
ASHLEY: The Barbed Fields?

03:38:03.729 --> 03:38:05.579
MATT: Yeah, right now, that's--

03:38:05.579 --> 03:38:07.498
LAURA: Yeah, that's where it was.

03:38:07.498 --> 03:38:08.403
MATT: Well, we'll pick up on that--

03:38:08.403 --> 03:38:10.408
TALIESIN: So excited. This is what I'm good at!
MATT: -- next week.

03:38:10.408 --> 03:38:13.362
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh my god!

03:38:13.362 --> 03:38:15.663
LIAM: Did you say its mouth was like a black void?

03:38:15.663 --> 03:38:17.838
MATT: Yeah, it was just like this open--
TALIESIN: (screeching)

03:38:17.838 --> 03:38:19.233
MARISHA: And it had no nose?

03:38:19.233 --> 03:38:20.066
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: So the bacon

03:38:20.066 --> 03:38:22.084
probably went (whizzing).

03:38:22.084 --> 03:38:23.317
(laughter)
TALIESIN: (screeching)

03:38:23.317 --> 03:38:25.117
MATT: I'll show you the picture next time.

03:38:25.117 --> 03:38:26.787
(laughter)

03:38:26.787 --> 03:38:28.563
But anyway.

03:38:28.563 --> 03:38:30.833
We'll see where this goes next episode.

03:38:30.833 --> 03:38:34.013
In the interm, we love you very much,

03:38:34.013 --> 03:38:36.293
and is it Thursday yet?

03:38:36.293 --> 03:38:38.058
Good night, guys.

02:26:19.226 --> 02:26:20.116
Hey, critters!

02:26:20.116 --> 02:26:21.366
Laura Bailey here.

02:26:21.366 --> 02:26:23.910
Let's see what's up in the "Critical Role" shop.

02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:25.646 line:20%
(upbeat jazz music)

02:26:25.646 --> 02:26:30.534 line:20%
It's perfect for the home or the office or your bathroom.

02:26:30.534 --> 02:26:31.521
(slides clicking)

02:26:31.521 --> 02:26:33.266
Oh, look at this!

02:26:33.266 --> 02:26:34.467
Look at the details.

02:26:34.467 --> 02:26:35.300
Oh!

02:26:37.048 --> 02:26:39.256 line:20%
Darling, I recommend buying two.

02:26:39.256 --> 02:26:42.626 line:20%
One for you, and another for you.

02:26:42.626 --> 02:26:43.691 line:20%
Let's be honest.

02:26:43.691 --> 02:26:45.106
(cloth tearing)

02:26:45.106 --> 02:26:46.076
It's so cute.

02:26:46.076 --> 02:26:47.420
I can't handle it.

02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:49.295
(cat meowing)

02:26:49.295 --> 02:26:51.186
This is a lot of stuff, you guys.

02:26:51.186 --> 02:26:53.883
We have, like, so many cool things right now.

02:26:55.391 --> 02:26:57.316
All of this and more, now available

02:26:57.316 --> 02:26:58.806
in the "Critical Role" shop.

02:26:58.806 --> 02:27:01.806
(upbeat jazz music)

02:27:03.739 --> 02:27:06.656
(a cappella music)

02:27:11.433 --> 02:27:14.029 line:20%
(bear growling)

02:27:14.029 --> 02:27:14.886
(cat meowing)

02:27:14.886 --> 02:27:16.616
We have a new stray cat that's been coming in our place

02:27:16.616 --> 02:27:18.596
that we refer to as Cleo.
I love that cat so much!

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:19.998
Yeah, you've met Cleo.
I've met Cleo.

02:27:19.998 --> 02:27:21.939
She's the best.
She's so cute!

02:27:21.939 --> 02:27:22.772
(man laughs)

02:27:22.772 --> 02:27:24.786
But you know what's not cute and cuddly?

02:27:24.786 --> 02:27:25.996
What?
"Cats" the movie.

02:27:25.996 --> 02:27:28.596
Here's the thing, I'm not judging "Cats" as a musical.

02:27:28.596 --> 02:27:29.596
Okay, that's fair.

02:27:29.596 --> 02:27:30.936
It just wasn't for me.

02:27:30.936 --> 02:27:32.816
Have you seen "Starlight Express?"

02:27:32.816 --> 02:27:33.649
No, I have not, actually.

02:27:33.649 --> 02:27:34.666
It's "Cats," but trains.

02:27:35.776 --> 02:27:37.286
And they fuck.

02:27:37.286 --> 02:27:38.326
Well.

02:27:38.326 --> 02:27:39.159
You're welcome.

02:27:39.159 --> 02:27:40.356
We're not talking about trains.

02:27:40.356 --> 02:27:41.189
No.

02:27:41.189 --> 02:27:42.022
We're talking about cats!

02:27:42.022 --> 02:27:42.855
Cats!

02:27:42.855 --> 02:27:43.692
Cats!

02:27:43.692 --> 02:27:44.525
(hosts laughing)

02:27:44.525 --> 02:27:47.676
And the "Cats" movie may have been an actual nightmare

02:27:47.676 --> 02:27:49.566
I'm still hoping I wake up from,

02:27:49.566 --> 02:27:51.866
but "Laser Kittens" is a delight.

02:27:51.866 --> 02:27:53.546
It is a collaborative storytelling game

02:27:53.546 --> 02:27:56.556
for three to five players where you play as new arrivals

02:27:56.556 --> 02:27:58.866
to the Knoll Street School for Wayward Kittens.

02:27:58.866 --> 02:27:59.699
Yeah.

02:27:59.699 --> 02:28:01.926
You get to play as friggin' kittens.

02:28:01.926 --> 02:28:03.676
You go on adventures, learn important lessons,

02:28:03.676 --> 02:28:05.776
avoid the horrors of the vacuum cleaner,

02:28:05.776 --> 02:28:07.756
and learn to control your laser,

02:28:07.756 --> 02:28:10.466
which is the chaotic power that all kittens secretly have,

02:28:10.466 --> 02:28:11.346
or not so secretly.

02:28:11.346 --> 02:28:12.501
Have you ever left a cat alone in your house?

02:28:12.501 --> 02:28:13.334
(cat meows)

02:28:13.334 --> 02:28:14.167
Your house is destroyed.

02:28:14.167 --> 02:28:15.676
Its cuteness is inescapable.

02:28:15.676 --> 02:28:18.076
It's like an "Event Horizon," but full of kittens.

02:28:18.076 --> 02:28:19.086
Hold on.

02:28:19.086 --> 02:28:20.496
I just gotta make a quick note, alright.

02:28:20.496 --> 02:28:24.696
New amazing idea: remake "Event Horizon," but adorable.

02:28:24.696 --> 02:28:25.529
That's gonna be great.
I'm on board.

02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:26.362
You're on board?
Yeah.

02:28:26.362 --> 02:28:27.195
Alright, I'm gonna sell you a copy.

02:28:27.195 --> 02:28:28.028
(man growls)

02:28:28.028 --> 02:28:28.861
(man meows)

02:28:28.861 --> 02:28:30.986
The game's authors, Stentor Danielson and Cheyenne Grimes,

02:28:30.986 --> 02:28:33.756
were working at the Western Pennsylvania Humane Society

02:28:33.756 --> 02:28:35.226
when they came up with the idea.

02:28:35.226 --> 02:28:37.496 line:20%
It's a perfect RPG for kids and adults alike.

02:28:37.496 --> 02:28:38.546 line:20%
The rules are simple.

02:28:38.546 --> 02:28:40.876 line:20%
You play with a deck of poker cards in lieu of dice,

02:28:40.876 --> 02:28:43.586 line:20%
and the only goals are to tell crazy kitten stories

02:28:43.586 --> 02:28:46.783 line:20%
and find a forever home for your little kitty character.

02:28:46.783 --> 02:28:49.456 line:20%
"Laser Kittens" is available for download now

02:28:49.456 --> 02:28:52.676 line:20%
at playglittercats.blogspot.com.

02:28:52.676 --> 02:28:54.766 line:20%
That's a mouthful, and you can buy the paperback

02:28:54.766 --> 02:28:56.276
on Indie Press Revolution.

02:28:56.276 --> 02:28:58.946
So, if you were a laser kitten, what power would you have?

02:28:58.946 --> 02:29:01.306
I would have the power that all cats have,

02:29:01.306 --> 02:29:02.226
whether or not they're laser-based,

02:29:02.226 --> 02:29:04.256
which is to sleep all the time.

02:29:04.256 --> 02:29:05.314
Oh, man!

02:29:05.314 --> 02:29:06.356
I need that.

02:29:06.356 --> 02:29:07.516
Could you imagine?

02:29:07.516 --> 02:29:09.286
And almost no consequences for all the shit

02:29:09.286 --> 02:29:10.119
they break and knock over.

02:29:10.119 --> 02:29:10.952
None!

02:29:10.952 --> 02:29:12.016
They could eat whatever they want,

02:29:12.016 --> 02:29:14.426
poop on the floor, knock over your expensive vase,

02:29:14.426 --> 02:29:16.036
and at the end of the day, they get head scratches.

02:29:16.036 --> 02:29:17.436
I still have friends that do that.

02:29:17.436 --> 02:29:18.736
I'm concerned about your friends

02:29:18.736 --> 02:29:20.421
who are pooping on the floor.

02:29:20.421 --> 02:29:21.526
(cat meowing)

02:29:21.526 --> 02:29:22.916
I'm concerned, too.

02:29:22.916 --> 02:29:23.749
Anyway!

02:29:23.749 --> 02:29:24.777
(woman laughing)

02:29:24.777 --> 02:29:27.694 line:20%
(a cappella music)

02:29:37.733 --> 02:29:40.483
(dramatic music)

02:30:08.436 --> 02:30:09.559
Subscribe,

02:30:11.266 --> 02:30:13.079
or don't subscribe.

02:30:14.898 --> 02:30:15.731
(man sighs)

02:30:15.731 --> 02:30:17.029
That's not a question.

02:30:19.336 --> 02:30:21.216
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

02:30:21.216 --> 02:30:25.889
to ponder the pros and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime,

02:30:27.286 --> 02:30:29.926
or to take hands and gift new subs

02:30:29.926 --> 02:30:32.349
to critters who find they can't afford them.

02:30:34.276 --> 02:30:35.239
To play.

02:30:38.146 --> 02:30:38.979
To sleep.

02:30:41.106 --> 02:30:41.939
No more.

02:30:43.486 --> 02:30:46.236
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew

02:30:46.236 --> 02:30:48.226
of "Critical Role" might find their naps

02:30:48.226 --> 02:30:51.516
around the hectic schedule of a live broadcast

02:30:51.516 --> 02:30:53.996
that we have brought for your consumption,

02:30:53.996 --> 02:30:56.639
both critter and fan alike.

02:30:59.296 --> 02:31:00.409
To play,

02:31:01.486 --> 02:31:02.379
or sleep.

02:31:05.716 --> 02:31:06.609
No sleep,

02:31:07.746 --> 02:31:09.609
but just to stream.

02:31:11.316 --> 02:31:12.949
Aye, there's the rub:

02:31:14.076 --> 02:31:18.539
for with your subscription, what streams may come.

02:31:22.596 --> 02:31:25.516
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fuckin' tagline.

02:31:25.516 --> 02:31:27.036
We got that?

02:31:27.036 --> 02:31:28.226
Oh.

02:31:28.226 --> 02:31:29.519
That is Twitch poetry.

02:31:30.898 --> 02:31:32.296
(man grunts)

02:31:32.296 --> 02:31:36.296
Oh, anyway, subscribe to "Critical Role."

02:31:36.296 --> 02:31:38.416
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

02:31:38.416 --> 02:31:40.876
Gift some subscriptions.

02:31:40.876 --> 02:31:41.709
You got it.

02:31:44.514 --> 02:31:45.806
(man grunts)

02:31:45.806 --> 02:31:49.409
Wrong soliloquy for the skull, but that's fuckin' good.

02:31:50.575 --> 02:31:53.492
(orchestral music)

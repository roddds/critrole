00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.719
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:08.708
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons! Before we get into it for

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:12.178
tonight's game, we're going to go through some
quick announcements, so be patient with this.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:17.983
First and foremost, returning for tonight, our
fantastic sponsor for campaign two thus far: our

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:21.110
friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond. Sam?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.971
SAM: Yes, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, a consistent and amazing
sponsor of our show, wants to let you guys know

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:35.958
that Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is out! Get yours
right now on the D&amp;amp;D Beyond website. To celebrate,

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.728
I called my old friend, Rhody Slater.

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:40.647
LAURA: No!

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:48.524
SAM: Ready? (As surfer) Hang ten, kahunas and
wahines! It's Rhody Slater! Duck diving the word

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:54.307
from D&amp;amp;D Beyond! Yank that leash and wrap up the
dawn patrol because if a player in your campaign

00:00:54.307 --> 00:01:01.788
has a master level subscription, any player that
owns Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes can share content

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:10.697
with everyone in your party. Frothy, right? Well,
kick out your longboard because-- Because--

00:01:10.697 --> 00:01:20.660
(As Sam) You know what, guys? I can't do this. It's
not D&amp;amp;D Beyond, they're a great sponsor. It's me.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:29.421
You know, I just felt like at this point in my
career I'd be doing serious shit like Ibsen or

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:40.024
O'Neill, but I'm doing this shitty Keanu Reeves
voice and writing crappy sitcom catchphrases. No

00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:49.055
offense, Ashley. This stuff is going to live on
the internet forever! My kids are going to watch

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:53.207
this and be like like, "Wow, your dad was a
loser," you know?

00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:55.035
LAURA: Yeah, that's what we think all the time.

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:58.533
SAM: I feel like I can do so much more.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:01:59.817
(phone rings)

00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:08.140
SAM: Oh sorry, I'm getting a phone call. This is
embarrassing. Hello? Yeah, uh-uh. Really? Yes! I

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:18.846
accept! Okay! Thank you. That was my agent. Guys,
I booked a two-spot local radio campaign for Lord

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:26.344
of the Wings, that new wing place in Chatsworth!
Two radio spots! I'm a real actor again! I'm back!

00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:33.357
All right! Where was I? (As surfer) So wax down
that twin fin and pull a thruster on an epic left

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:42.460
because D&amp;amp;D Beyond is righteous! Banzai! (as Sam)
What a crazy turn of events.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.635
MATT: I'm so happy. I'm so proud of you. You did
it, Sam.

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.693
TRAVIS: Congrats man, congrats buddy. Hashtag
booked it!

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:53.138
MARISHA: Wow, that was so authentic to the actor
experience.

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:57.429
LAURA: And really believable.

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:02.779
SAM: Lord of the Wings is not a bad restaurant.
It's just average.

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.984
MARISHA: It's a regional spot!

00:03:05.984 --> 00:03:09.184
SAM: I might get some residuals.

00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:16.410
LIAM: On a side note, Matt, you look so quietly
pained to hear Mordenkainen bathed in whatever

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.229
that was.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:22.799
MATT: I wasn't pained, I was more contemplating
the fact that those two facets have never combined

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.094
until this point probably. (surfer voice) Probably
haven't heard anyone talk about Otiluke's

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:38.889
Resilient Sphere. (normal voice) I like the prospect of
a super Big Sur surf tour of D&amp;amp;D wizard names.

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:51.268
ASHLEY: Lord of the Wings, I would go there. Just
as a side note. Morden-cayenne wings! Let's do it.

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:52.048
TRAVIS: Road trip.

00:03:52.048 --> 00:04:02.556
MATT: "Would you like your pasta with Saruman the
White sauce?" Thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&amp;amp;D

00:04:02.914 --> 00:04:10.959
Beyond, for being our amazing sponsor. And
congratulations on your booking. First up, Vox

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:17.052
Machina: Origins the hardcover collection, the
actual physical tome of our first six-run comic

00:04:17.052 --> 00:04:20.110
series will be on sale next week on May 31st!

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:27.540
LIAM: So shiny and beautiful! Oh my gosh, Laura
wants to hold it.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.435
ASHLEY: I love it!

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.104
SAM: Get your fingerprints off it!

00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:33.415
LAURA: I just want to look at it, but you said I
had to show it.

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:36.586
MARISHA: It smells good, too. It smells like new
comic.

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:39.051
LIAM: Because it is a new comic!

00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:39.627
MARISHA: Exactly!

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:43.433
TALIESIN: It's got some crazy back matter, too.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.309
MATT: It does. Let me see real fast.

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.247
LAURA: It's so pretty!

00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:51.419
MATT: It's got some fun stuff and it's got some
extra specials in the back.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.894
LAURA: Wait, we can show it? Are we going to show
it?

00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:58.513
MATT: I'm going to flip it real fast. We've got a
map of Stilben. Ooh! It's gone now. We've got

00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:07.915
character traits and actions. We've got magical
items! We've got sketches and various art pieces

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:12.959
that show the process of development. There you
go. It's got a whole bunch of cool extras in the

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:18.832
back. Anyway, that's available next week, May
31st. For all info of the sale of the comic, check

00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:22.667

right now. Awesome!

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:23.200
LIAM: Critrole!

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.114
MATT: It came back, we couldn't leave it alone.

00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:34.832
but next weekend. Friday through Sunday, June 1st

Foster hosts a little chat about whatever happens

00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:16.323
about tonight's episode, for next week.

00:06:16.323 --> 00:06:17.546
SAM: That was the saddest woo-hoo.

00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:18.140
MATT: That was-- yeah.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.349
LAURA: Did you just steal the comic book?

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:19.889
ASHLEY: Huh?

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:20.726
LIAM: Where did it go?

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:22.282
ASHLEY: Oh, what? What?

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:23.977
TRAVIS: Roll a stealth check.

00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:29.158
ASHLEY: This is the way I'm shaped, what's wrong?
This is my shape.

00:06:29.158 --> 00:06:30.381
TRAVIS: The Cube 2.0!

00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:33.170
ASHLEY: This is my body, leave me alone.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.528
LIAM: Oh man, that Ashley, she's so... boxy.

00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:39.571
TRAVIS: Boxy!
(hums the intro to "Foxy Lady")

00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:48.895
MATT: There you go. We have the Critical Role Live
dice set in the store, as well as the Vox Machina

00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:51.255
d20 set is back in stock for a limited time.

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:52.274
LAURA: Is it still there?

00:06:52.274 --> 00:06:53.002
MATT: It's on the list here.

00:06:53.002 --> 00:06:53.643
LAURA: Sweet.

00:06:53.643 --> 00:07:00.497
MATT: If it's not, I'm sorry. I only read what's
handed to me. I feel like Ron Burgundy. I will be

00:07:00.497 --> 00:07:04.941
at A-Kon in Texas, Dallas/Fort Worth, June 7th to
the 10th. Looking forward to see you guys there.

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.508
Actually probably the 8th to 10th for me because
we have Thursday night that night, but I'll see

00:07:08.508 --> 00:07:13.751
you there. I believe those are all of our
announcements for the evening which means, it's

00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:19.866
time to bring us back into Exandria for tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

00:07:19.866 --> 00:07:24.126
[click, TV static]

00:07:24.126 --> 00:08:41.702
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:45.945
MATT: And welcome back. I forgot one quick thing
in the announcements, something I need to get you

00:08:45.945 --> 00:08:49.536
guys to up to speed on. We've partnered with our
friends at Stack Up, which is a nonprofit

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.856
organization dedicated to helping veterans and
those in active duty. Stack Up will be giving away

00:08:54.856 --> 00:08:59.220
specific Critical Role challenge coins as well as
special prints by our fantastic Critter artist Amy

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.811
King. If you want to be part of this fantastic
endeavor and see how to acquire your special

00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:09.666
challenge coin and our print, also go to
critrole.com for all the information you need. Make

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:14.545
sure I got that in there for you guys, and thank
you guys at Stack Up for working with us on

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:21.795
this. On that note: last we left off, The Mighty
Nein, after spending quite some time in the

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:29.657
central city of Zadash had found that war had made
its way to the Empire with the far eastern region

00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:36.283
of Xhorhas and the Kryn dynasty. Upon this
conflict, you decided that perhaps it would be

00:09:36.283 --> 00:09:43.518
best to leave the central urban environment. You
decided to dodge a few opportunities brought to

00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:49.377
you, especially that by the Lawmaster of the city,
and instead went and made a conversation with your

00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:55.491
friend The Gentleman beneath the city in his
Underworks. There, he offered two possible work

00:09:55.491 --> 00:10:00.819
opportunities in which you accepted both. The
first of which is going to send you towards the

00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:07.692
swamp town of Berleben, to the north-northeast.
Then from there, head far northeast to Shadycreek

00:10:07.726 --> 00:10:14.576
Run to converse with and retrieve an ally of his
he had not been able to do business with in a

00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:21.295
while. You gathered your materials, got your wagon
and horses, made your way northward on the

00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:30.215
Bromkiln Byway toward the Labenda Swamp. Along
that path, you managed to encounter a shack-living

00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:37.946
hermited orc of some unknown background. Continuing
northward, you slept in a cluster of trees where

00:10:37.946 --> 00:10:46.425
you were ambushed by a wandering troupe of goblins
and ogres. Upon escaping their clutches and

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:51.691
defeating most of them-- only one, I believe, got
free-- you gathered what information you could.

00:10:51.789 --> 00:11:02.239
Managing to keep out of the rain, you slept
beneath your cart and awaited the next morning. As

00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:05.826
we come back in, you all have had your long rest, so if
you haven't marked that in your character sheet,

00:11:05.826 --> 00:11:07.056
please do so.

00:11:07.056 --> 00:11:11.834
SAM: And we leveled up.

00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:12.884
MATT: No.

00:11:12.884 --> 00:11:15.005
LAURA: Yeah, level six!

00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:23.447
MATT: No, that didn't happen. As you come to, the
cold morning greets you, the low mist and fog seem

00:11:23.447 --> 00:11:30.317
to still clutch the outer edges of the forest
trees beyond your peripheral. You can just see the

00:11:30.317 --> 00:11:39.470
dark shapes of the trunks against the obscured
gray. The mist and dew that is gathered on the

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:44.882
grass and bits of vegetation near the base of the
floor where you've slept has turned to frost with

00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:51.067
the cold night. Most of you managed to complete
your rest uncomfortably, but awake to chattering

00:11:51.067 --> 00:11:54.027
teeth and the shaking of your body. Except for
Jester.

00:11:54.027 --> 00:11:57.673
LAURA: I walk around and crunch all of that frost.
(crunching)

00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:01.917
MATT: The morning is yours. What do you wish to
do?

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:06.158
TRAVIS: What? You never fucking get cold or
nothing?

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:08.475
LAURA: I don't think so, no.

00:12:08.475 --> 00:12:12.229
TALIESIN: Let's get up and moving.

00:12:12.229 --> 00:12:16.883
TRAVIS: Yeah, please. Anybody got whiskey or
something? Nott! You got any booze?

00:12:16.883 --> 00:12:18.133
SAM: Of course I do.

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:19.785
TRAVIS: Would you mind if I swig?

00:12:19.785 --> 00:12:21.687
SAM: Sure, here's my flask.

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:24.096
TRAVIS: Thanks. It's always full.

00:12:24.096 --> 00:12:28.227
LAURA: Is it always full or it is always almost
empty?

00:12:28.227 --> 00:12:34.175
SAM: Well, I can't see inside it, so I don't know.
But I'm sure there's some sort experiment we

00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:39.594
could do to-- It's all right, you can have as much
as you want. It's endless.

00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:42.910
LAURA: You don't have to buy alcohol at all
anymore?

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:50.895
SAM: No. I mean, I rarely did anyway. I stole it,
but now I don't have to do that either!

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.600
LAURA: That's wonderful!

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.208
SAM: Yeah. I think it's about two-thirds full most
of the time.

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:56.421
ASHLEY: May I try it?

00:12:56.421 --> 00:12:57.394
SAM: Sure.

00:12:57.394 --> 00:13:00.308
TRAVIS: It's really good, it spreads through your
chest like a fire.

00:13:00.308 --> 00:13:02.274
LAURA: How do you decide which alcohol is in it?

00:13:02.274 --> 00:13:07.189
SAM: I decided the first time and that's what it
is, always.

00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:09.616
LAURA: What if you get sick of it? You can't empty
it out.

00:13:09.616 --> 00:13:11.899
SAM: Why would I get sick of it? It's wonderful.

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:15.210
LAURA: What if you want to try a different thing
like--

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.446
TALIESIN: Snozzberry.

00:13:16.446 --> 00:13:17.479
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:17.479 --> 00:13:21.870
ASHLEY: Does it only fill up with one kind of
alcohol?

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.975
SAM: Yes, it replenishes with my favorite kind of
whiskey.

00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:28.910
TRAVIS: Which is?

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.232
SAM: The kind that gets you good and drunk.

00:13:32.232 --> 00:13:34.333
TRAVIS: Oh good. I didn't know if it had a name.

00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:37.731
TALIESIN: I tried the other kind before, and
really, it's not much.

00:13:37.731 --> 00:13:39.608
ASHLEY: The kind that doesn't get you drunk is not
very good.

00:13:39.608 --> 00:13:40.686
TRAVIS: Good and drunk.

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:42.880
LIAM: Can you get it empty or close to empty if
you try?

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.979
SAM: I could try.

00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:46.367
LIAM: I am not suggesting you try.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.935
SAM: I think it's a good experiment.

00:13:47.935 --> 00:13:48.678
TRAVIS: I think so, too.

00:13:48.822 --> 00:13:49.686
ASHLEY: I do, too.

00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:51.755
SAM: They already started it.

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:55.841
LAURA: Maybe we shouldn't do that right before we
go to the swamp where we're going to fight people.

00:13:55.841 --> 00:14:02.101
SAM: Let's just see what happens! I'll drink a
bunch.

00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:06.127
MATT: Okay. You are very drunk.

00:14:06.232 --> 00:14:08.455
SAM: Did it get lower?

00:14:08.575 --> 00:14:11.633
LIAM: I grab and shake it, with my thumb over the
spigot.

00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:17.648
MATT: It's still filled with liquid. I mean, you
drank a lot, and it still feels like half-full.

00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:19.944
TRAVIS: Should you puke it up?

00:14:19.944 --> 00:14:22.985
SAM: (slurred) I don't want to waste it.

00:14:22.985 --> 00:14:25.325
LAURA: You can't really waste it.

00:14:25.325 --> 00:14:26.762
MARISHA: Yeah, it's bottomless.

00:14:26.762 --> 00:14:28.450
TALIESIN: You've already used it at this point,
really.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.299
SAM: (slurred) I guess I could. Should I throw up
now?

00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:35.375
LAURA: Maybe you should try.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.543
MARISHA: In the name of science.

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:37.786
SAM: Stick something down my throat.

00:14:37.786 --> 00:14:39.268
TRAVIS: Nott, just put your finger down your
throat.

00:14:39.268 --> 00:14:40.605
LAURA: I find a stick. Open up!

00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:46.975
SAM: (yelling and gagging) Did it work?

00:14:46.975 --> 00:14:50.441
MATT: Eventually, yes.

00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:53.287
LAURA: I don't want to hurt your throat, you
know.

00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:58.890
TRAVIS: Face pointing up, though, so it projectile
Bouncing Betty vomits everywhere?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:07.933
MATT: In a very Ren and Stimpy fashion, Jester
begins jamming this stick into Nott's gullet,

00:15:07.933 --> 00:15:16.702
before the brackish brown whiskey comes back up in
a mild spray against the nearby, now damp, dirt

00:15:16.702 --> 00:15:17.858
and grass.

00:15:17.858 --> 00:15:20.032
TRAVIS: Is it steaming in the early morning cold?

00:15:20.032 --> 00:15:21.293
MATT: It would be.

00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:25.365
LAURA: But do you feel better though?

00:15:25.365 --> 00:15:26.645
SAM: No, not really.

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:28.805
LIAM: Probably not, how is your esophagus after
that?

00:15:28.805 --> 00:15:31.866
SAM: A little sticky.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:33.427
TRAVIS: A little salsa?

00:15:33.427 --> 00:15:34.353
SAM: Yeah.

00:15:34.353 --> 00:15:35.309
MARISHA: A little burny?

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.735
LIAM: How many fingers am I holding up?

00:15:37.735 --> 00:15:39.643
SAM: I think four?

00:15:39.643 --> 00:15:42.827
LIAM: How many members of The Mighty Nein are
there?

00:15:42.827 --> 00:15:43.775
SAM: Nine.

00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:45.145
LIAM: She's okay.

00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:48.782
SAM: But two are always gone.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.854
LIAM: It's true.

00:15:51.854 --> 00:15:59.218
ASHLEY: I feel like when I see someone else throw
up I feel almost like I do (retching). No?

00:15:59.218 --> 00:16:00.473
TALIESIN: No.

00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:02.274
TRAVIS: That's a violent reaction.

00:16:02.274 --> 00:16:04.355
LIAM: Jester, help her out there, she's in need.

00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:07.107
LAURA: Do you want me to stick something down your
throat?

00:16:07.107 --> 00:16:12.383
ASHLEY: No, I mean, I don't know if that will
help. I think it was just gross to see (retching).

00:16:12.383 --> 00:16:15.064
Uh-oh. It's still happening.

00:16:15.064 --> 00:16:21.426
TALIESIN: Is it just seeing someone throw up or is
it also hearing the sound that makes it worse? If

00:16:21.426 --> 00:16:23.095
I just went (retching) does that--

00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:24.473
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think it's the sound, too.

00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:25.468
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:16:25.468 --> 00:16:30.699
LIAM: Looking at our map, how much longer do I
think we have to go to get to our destination?

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:36.359
MATT: If you move quickly, you can probably get
there right around sunset.

00:16:36.359 --> 00:16:40.880
MARISHA: Is this quickly like "not paying close
attention" quickly?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.232
MATT: It's "not carefully and quietly" quickly.

00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:45.481
TRAVIS: I think we're good for that.

00:16:45.481 --> 00:16:46.443
MARISHA: Yeah, we're fine.

00:16:46.443 --> 00:16:51.715
TRAVIS: We're not concerned at all about that--
what do you call it when you get ambushed?

00:16:51.824 --> 00:16:53.401
MARISHA, LIAM, and TALIESIN: Ambush.

00:16:53.401 --> 00:16:54.935
TRAVIS: Last night.

00:16:54.935 --> 00:16:57.208
SAM: You're our strategy guy, right?

00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:58.826
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:16:59.098 --> 00:16:59.973
SAM: Okay.

00:16:59.973 --> 00:17:01.755
TRAVIS: It's early in the morning, I'm not awake
yet.

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:02.747
LAURA: We beat them, though.

00:17:02.747 --> 00:17:06.997
TALIESIN: We've been traveling for years, we've
been ambushed dozens of times.

00:17:06.997 --> 00:17:10.547
TRAVIS: I'm just checking. Didn't know if anybody
was alarmed.

00:17:10.547 --> 00:17:12.477
LAURA: Is it normally ogres that ambush you?

00:17:12.477 --> 00:17:14.008
TALIESIN: No, that was new and exciting.

00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:19.176
ASHLEY: Especially if we're staying on the main
path, you know, we'll see anything that pops up.

00:17:19.176 --> 00:17:21.543
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

00:17:21.543 --> 00:17:27.135
LIAM: We want to rush? You want to rush? Let's
take it slow and we're going to get to the swamp

00:17:27.135 --> 00:17:31.755
just as the sun is going down if we rush, and that
is full of nasty things, I'm sure.

00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:33.912
TRAVIS: That's actually a very good point.

00:17:33.912 --> 00:17:35.822
LIAM: If we go slower--

00:17:35.822 --> 00:17:37.231
TALIESIN: We get there in the day.

00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:38.735
LIAM: Yeah.

00:17:38.735 --> 00:17:40.003
TRAVIS: Carefully then?

00:17:40.003 --> 00:17:42.484
TALIESIN: I don't mind camping out.

00:17:42.484 --> 00:17:43.889
LAURA: One more time?

00:17:43.889 --> 00:17:45.176
TALIESIN: One more time.

00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:48.099
LIAM: You all are an enjoyable lot, it will be
fun.

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:50.996
LAURA: That was very believable, Caleb.

00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:52.072
MARISHA: I think he was being genuine.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.226
TALIESIN: That was very impressive. Thank you.

00:17:53.226 --> 00:17:54.969
MARISHA: I feel like that was the most emotion--

00:17:54.969 --> 00:17:56.498
LAURA: I think I've ever seen.

00:17:56.498 --> 00:17:58.397
TRAVIS: Is Caleb blushing at all?

00:17:58.397 --> 00:18:03.013
MARISHA: A little. His ears are getting a little
pink.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.022
LIAM: Maybe a little.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.936
TRAVIS: All right, saddle up them dogies.

00:18:08.047 --> 00:18:13.916
(laughter)

00:18:13.916 --> 00:18:16.687
LAURA: Does anybody else want to drive the cart
today, or do you want me to keep driving it?

00:18:16.687 --> 00:18:19.927
TALIESIN: I'll drive if you want to switch out
later on.

00:18:19.927 --> 00:18:21.127
LAURA: Yeah.

00:18:21.127 --> 00:18:24.154
TALIESIN: All right. I got it. Nott, I assume you
want to be in back.

00:18:24.154 --> 00:18:32.267
MATT: Molly up front keeping the horses on task,
you guys pick up the pace and get back out of the

00:18:32.267 --> 00:18:39.218
forest main cluster and onto the Bromkiln Byway
heading north-northeast once more.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.420
LIAM: Carefully.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.547
MATT: Are you moving at the slowest pace?

00:18:42.547 --> 00:18:44.176
LAURA: Not the slowest pace.

00:18:44.176 --> 00:18:45.373
TRAVIS: Medium. A five.

00:18:45.373 --> 00:18:46.928
LAURA: A normal pace.

00:18:46.928 --> 00:18:51.463
MATT: (singing) I drive the cart at a medium pace.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:56.602
LIAM: Not willy-nilly, not galloping pace.

00:18:56.602 --> 00:19:05.314
MATT: Pressing forward, what two are maintaining a
watch as you progress?

00:19:05.314 --> 00:19:06.987
LAURA and LIAM: I want to watch.

00:19:06.987 --> 00:19:09.552
MATT: One of you is aiding the other. Who is
helming the roll?

00:19:09.552 --> 00:19:12.648
LAURA: I want to stand on the cart and stand up
for the ride and look around.

00:19:12.648 --> 00:19:17.810
MATT: It's like Muad'Dib riding the sandworm,
standing up.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.870
LAURA: I'll put my hands on Molly's horns and--

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.293
TALIESIN: I'm into this.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:28.442
ASHLEY: I'll take the back. Caleb, can I hold
Frumpkin again?

00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:30.006
LAURA: Am I rolling twice?

00:19:30.006 --> 00:19:31.049
LIAM: Twice, yes.

00:19:31.049 --> 00:19:32.211
ASHLEY: I like him.

00:19:32.211 --> 00:19:35.222
TALIESIN: I also do have a large tapestry that's
relatively clean if anyone's feeling cold.

00:19:35.222 --> 00:19:44.518
SAM: That's not good. Could we make that tapestry
into coats?

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:48.407
LAURA: Nine! Because it's appropriate.

00:19:48.407 --> 00:19:58.065
MATT: For the first half of the day, you continue
along the path. It gets rough in places, and at

00:19:58.185 --> 00:20:01.785
one point one of the wheels slams into a rock. You
have to double check and make sure it didn't take

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:03.566
any damage. It seems to be okay.

00:20:03.566 --> 00:20:04.783
LIAM: We saw that.

00:20:04.783 --> 00:20:07.114
TALIESIN: I can drive.

00:20:07.114 --> 00:20:12.216
MATT: For the first half of the day, nothing
catches your eye in particular. The mist has

00:20:12.216 --> 00:20:16.312
burned off at this point, and a bit of sunlight is
breaking through the clouds. It seems the storm

00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:22.563
from the evening before has passed. You can see
now over the mostly gray cloud cover, there are

00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:28.443
breaks in it, from this distance you can see these
visible beams of sunlight slowly coasting across

00:20:28.443 --> 00:20:34.299
the grass fields as you see the heavy, high grass
pushing and pulling with each burst of breeze that

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:38.193
makes its way across the valley. It's very
beautiful here in the center of the Empire. It's a

00:20:38.193 --> 00:20:45.336
very relaxing ride, though you know you're
book-ending your travel with tension to stress, so

00:20:45.336 --> 00:20:51.704
you're taking this moment to appreciate what it is
the Empire protects and what the people within are

00:20:51.704 --> 00:20:57.730
fighting for in the coming conflict. Second half
if the day, same people on watch?

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.602
MARISHA and ASHLEY: I'll take a watch.

00:21:01.602 --> 00:21:03.574
LAURA: I'll sit down, I've been standing for such
a long time.

00:21:03.574 --> 00:21:06.283
MATT: It's true, give those ankles a rest. Who's
helming the roll?

00:21:06.283 --> 00:21:08.240
MARISHA: I'll helm.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.798
MATT: You're aiding Beau. Roll with advantage.

00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:13.721
MARISHA and MATT: 18.

00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:17.204
MARISHA: Sorry, 17.

00:21:17.204 --> 00:21:24.721
MATT: 17, all right. Continuing your pace, Beau as
you're watching out, from a north-northwestern

00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:30.947
direction, you see a dark shape come over one of
the hilltops, wide and encompassing.

00:21:30.947 --> 00:21:32.328
MARISHA: Moving?

00:21:32.328 --> 00:21:36.047
MATT: It seems to be. A number of miles out of the
way, almost on the horizon, you can see this

00:21:36.047 --> 00:21:41.466
series of rolling hills in that direction that
obscure what lies beyond that area. You watch as

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:47.989
one of the hills goes dark on top, like the
coloration gets covered in shade.

00:21:47.989 --> 00:21:50.531
MARISHA: What does the weather look like? Are
there clouds in the sky?

00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:54.611
MATT: There are clouds in the sky, especially at
this time of year, it's generally pretty cloudy

00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:59.202
here in the Empire. You've seen breaks in the
clouds as you've traveled for most of the day, it's

00:21:59.202 --> 00:22:04.661
been warmer than usual, so it's been a welcome
change of pace from what you're used to, but this

00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:09.110
is not characteristic of cloud cover, as most
everything here has some level of shade.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.350
TRAVIS: Still rolling grasslands, or are there
trees off to the side?

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.839
MATT: There are bits of trees and clusters of
them, nothing that would be considered a major forest.

00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:20.488
What you slept in the night before has probably
been the largest cluster you've seen in your

00:22:20.488 --> 00:22:22.948
travel today so far. This catches you.

00:22:22.948 --> 00:22:27.716
MARISHA: It looks like the landscape is going
dark? Not something moved in front of it, or like

00:22:27.716 --> 00:22:28.676
something is moving?

00:22:28.676 --> 00:22:30.458
MATT: Correct. Best you can tell at this distance.

00:22:30.458 --> 00:22:34.670
MARISHA: Who's got good eyes and knows about
clouds and shit?

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.513
NOTT: Caleb knows about clouds.

00:22:37.513 --> 00:22:40.186
LIAM: I've spent a long time on the road, too.

00:22:40.186 --> 00:22:42.229
MARISHA: Does that look natural to you?

00:22:42.229 --> 00:22:47.616
MATT: You both look out there and as you travel
for the next ten minutes or so, you can see faint

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:55.199
glimmers in that moving shadow as a bit of
sunlight travels over it. It's at that moment you

00:22:55.199 --> 00:23:03.876
realize what this is. It's a legion. What was a
dark shadow appears to be hundreds and hundreds of

00:23:03.876 --> 00:23:11.098
soldiers, an army regiment that is shifting from
the northwestern side of the Empire to cross over

00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:18.499
the byway, heading east. As you continue your pace
forward, you get to a point where you may

00:23:18.499 --> 00:23:22.031
intersect with their path if you continue, or you
can slow down or speed up. It's your choice.

00:23:22.031 --> 00:23:28.058
LIAM: There are a lot of soldiers ahead, and I
don't think we should have anything to do with them.

00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:32.814
LAURA: Plus if we wait, it'll take a really long
time for them to cross the road.

00:23:32.814 --> 00:23:34.623
LIAM: That's a very good point.

00:23:34.623 --> 00:23:37.379
MARISHA: If we move, though, we have to move fast,
and maybe a little bit carefully.

00:23:37.379 --> 00:23:38.862
LAURA: Let's go! Go!

00:23:38.862 --> 00:23:40.040
MARISHA: All right.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.769
MATT: With that (galloping) the horses begin to
pick up pace. You all grab the sides of the cart

00:23:43.769 --> 00:23:49.090
as it begins to whir and kick its way across the
street. The horses galloping, framing the two

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.027
different sides of the cart as you pick up speed.
You come up over one of the hills and then down

00:23:53.027 --> 00:23:58.325
another embankment. As you curve around the side,
there's a part where the grass has overgrown a

00:23:58.325 --> 00:24:02.300
large majority of the road here, but you coast
through the center.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.233
LAURA: We should stand up and ride it like a
surfboard!

00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:06.678
TALIESIN: Let's not do that.

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:07.944
SAM: Like Teen Wolf?

00:24:07.944 --> 00:24:08.873
LAURA: Yeah!

00:24:08.873 --> 00:24:11.004
MATT: Make a general animal handling check if you
don't mind, Molly.

00:24:11.004 --> 00:24:13.560
TALIESIN: Seven?

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.643
MATT: Okay.

00:24:14.643 --> 00:24:16.258
SAM: That's terrible.

00:24:16.258 --> 00:24:21.240
MATT: As you hit that portion of the road, you're
having a hard time steering the horses, you're not

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.314
entirely familiar enough to pull on the rein of
multiple at a single time to get the shift and

00:24:26.314 --> 00:24:30.205
movement. They begin to careen a little bit off of
the path, almost trying to hide into the grass

00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:34.871
embankment which slows your movement down ever so
slightly, before (impact) one of the wheels

00:24:34.871 --> 00:24:40.487
suddenly (impact and scraping). It is now digging
into the ground.

00:24:40.487 --> 00:24:43.763
TALIESIN: I can desperately try and right the
stuff, I suppose.

00:24:43.763 --> 00:24:45.470
LAURA: Did it break the wheel?

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:50.305
MATT: The cart is now sitting at a backward angle
and it's slowing down.

00:24:50.305 --> 00:24:53.869
LAURA: We could climb to the other side of the
cart and try to balance it so the wheel comes up.

00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:57.374
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull hard on the reins, see
if I can get it out of the--

00:24:57.374 --> 00:24:59.070
SAM: And continue, or stop?

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.310
TALIESIN: Oh, are we "stop" stopped?

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.982
MATT: It's grinding to a halt.

00:25:01.982 --> 00:25:04.432
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm stopping the whole thing
really quickly.

00:25:04.432 --> 00:25:08.012
ASHLEY: I'm going to hop off the horse and go
look.

00:25:08.012 --> 00:25:15.902
MARISHA: Can I go ahead a little bit and see if I
find any hidden paths that might cut through this

00:25:15.902 --> 00:25:19.023
field, off the main road? Scout ahead a little
bit.

00:25:19.023 --> 00:25:26.743
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check. You go
and check. It looks like some sort of heavy rock

00:25:26.743 --> 00:25:32.991
that was hidden and obscured in the grass, just
off the road, had slammed into both wheels on the

00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:38.397
left side. The front one had bent, the wood
splintered inward and the metallic rim on the

00:25:38.397 --> 00:25:42.056
inside had bent inward. The other one had
completely been pushed inward and knocked at the

00:25:42.056 --> 00:25:44.938
angle, it's pretty wrecked.

00:25:44.938 --> 00:25:46.971
LAURA: Oh no, is it fixable?

00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:53.338
MATT: Do any of you guys have tools to fix a
wagon?

00:25:53.338 --> 00:25:54.761
LAURA: Would we know?

00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:58.369
MATT: What toolkits would you have at your
disposal?

00:25:58.369 --> 00:26:02.562
LIAM: Your background would tell you, if you chose
a background, what bag of shit you have.

00:26:02.562 --> 00:26:05.484
MATT: Your background may have abilities that
could help you in this scenario as well.

00:26:05.484 --> 00:26:07.474
TRAVIS: Vehicles in water.

00:26:07.474 --> 00:26:12.626
MATT: Things that are helpful: carpenter's tools,
possibly. That's kind of rough.

00:26:12.626 --> 00:26:14.126
MARISHA: I have ball bearings.

00:26:14.126 --> 00:26:16.709
LAURA: I have an axe.

00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:21.159
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure I saw carpenter's tools
and I was like, who needs that?

00:26:21.285 --> 00:26:22.963
MATT: Anybody?

00:26:22.963 --> 00:26:28.831
TALIESIN: I've got a hammer, I've got some rope. I
don't know.

00:26:28.831 --> 00:26:29.919
MATT: No.

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:32.757
ASHLEY: I have rope. I have lots of rope.

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:36.968
TRAVIS: I think we're going to need to double up
on these horses, you guys. Or at least unhitch

00:26:36.968 --> 00:26:38.154
them from the wagon.

00:26:38.154 --> 00:26:41.484
LAURA: Yeah, and get all of our stuff off of the
cart. But I have our giant lead safe in here.

00:26:41.484 --> 00:26:43.362
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:26:43.362 --> 00:26:44.474
ASHLEY: How heavy is it?

00:26:44.474 --> 00:26:46.178
LAURA: It's pretty heavy.

00:26:46.178 --> 00:26:54.745
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
the regiment is coming up over a nearer hill and

00:26:54.745 --> 00:27:00.568
it's about half a mile off from you now. As it's
marching, you can hear the distant rustling of

00:27:00.568 --> 00:27:04.042
hundreds and hundreds of footfalls making their way
through the field.

00:27:04.042 --> 00:27:05.337
TRAVIS: In our direction?

00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:07.369
MATT: It looks like they're going to be probably
passing in front of you.

00:27:07.369 --> 00:27:08.428
SAM: Should we hide?

00:27:08.428 --> 00:27:09.606
MARISHA: I rolled a 15.

00:27:09.606 --> 00:27:18.063
MATT: You rolled a 15? There is no natural paths
here, it's an open field. There are areas where

00:27:18.063 --> 00:27:24.292
the grass isn't quite as dense, and there are some
spots where some of the dirt isn't as receptive to

00:27:24.292 --> 00:27:31.427
grass. You find patches of dry ground, but there
are no paths that you notice leading out of this

00:27:31.427 --> 00:27:32.787
space, unfortunately.

00:27:32.787 --> 00:27:34.112
TALIESIN: You don't know any Mending magic, do
you?

00:27:34.112 --> 00:27:36.374
LAURA: (gasps) I have Mending! I have a Mending
cantrip.

00:27:36.374 --> 00:27:38.619
MATT: You do. What's the space on Mending?

00:27:38.619 --> 00:27:43.883
TALIESIN: You're welcome. I'm sitting here
thinking, if only we had a Mending cantrip of some kind.

00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:44.956
LAURA: I have that!

00:27:44.956 --> 00:27:47.053
LIAM: I have, for two minutes, been thinking: If
only I had the Mending spell.

00:27:47.053 --> 00:27:52.950
LAURA: You guys, I can mend things. Thanks for
reminding me on that, Molly.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.665
TALIESIN: I just had to say it out loud.

00:27:54.665 --> 00:27:56.214
SAM: Can you try it on the wheel?

00:27:56.214 --> 00:27:58.321
LIAM: (pigeon coo)

00:27:58.321 --> 00:27:59.938
LAURA: Yeah, I can try it.

00:27:59.938 --> 00:28:02.330
SAM: Let's just do it! Let's see what happens.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:08.838
MATT: As you focus on the front wheel, the one
that had just dented inward and the wood

00:28:08.838 --> 00:28:14.781
splintered a bit, that was barely keeping it up,
the wheel rights itself. The metal bends back into

00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:19.359
place, the wood splinters kick right in, the
spokes are as if they were untouched.

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:20.552
LAURA: Guys, I'm amazing!

00:28:20.552 --> 00:28:21.696
SAM: Yes, you are!

00:28:21.696 --> 00:28:26.270
LAURA: That would have been way more amazing if
I'd remembered that I could do this. Let me try it

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.795
on this other wheel, though.

00:28:27.795 --> 00:28:29.654
SAM: Wait, we have two broken wheels?

00:28:29.654 --> 00:28:35.114
MATT: Yeah, one was partially damaged, the other
one was pretty wrecked. The other wheel,

00:28:35.114 --> 00:28:42.314
unfortunately, has taken a fair amount of damage
from the impact, and the lower half of it has

00:28:42.314 --> 00:28:49.107
broken inward, it's splintered out and it's bent
its way off of the axle. Unfortunately, it's a bit

00:28:49.107 --> 00:28:50.837
too big for the Mending cantrip to fix.

00:28:50.837 --> 00:28:54.763
ASHLEY: Can I try to punch it into place?

00:28:54.788 --> 00:29:00.485
MATT: It's pretty wrecked. You do have three
wheels, which means you could try it.

00:29:00.485 --> 00:29:02.661
ASHLEY: One of us could be a wheel?

00:29:02.661 --> 00:29:05.817
MATT: Yasha curls up around the axle.

00:29:05.817 --> 00:29:08.713
MARISHA: How far away is the army?

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:12.556
MATT: You probably have about ten minutes before
they cross over the byway.

00:29:12.556 --> 00:29:15.721
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to come over and be like:
I think we should hide and wait until these guys

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:17.511
pass with this being the situation.

00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:19.792
LIAM: How tall is the grass around here?

00:29:19.792 --> 00:29:26.993
MATT: Beauregard, Caleb, Molly and Jester, you
guys notice, breaking away from the regiment above,

00:29:26.993 --> 00:29:32.992
you see a cluster of horses heading in your
direction. You are out in the open.

00:29:32.992 --> 00:29:34.605
MARISHA: Are we going to get questioned?

00:29:34.605 --> 00:29:40.008
SAM: We could pull the cart off the road if Yasha
picks it up and runs along with it.

00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:43.009
ASHLEY: I could try. We could also kill those
people and take their horses.

00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:44.882
LAURA: No, I think the army would see it.

00:29:44.882 --> 00:29:48.213
TRAVIS: I'll use Disguise Self and I'll turn
myself into a crownsguard.

00:29:48.213 --> 00:29:49.545
MATT: Okay.

00:29:49.545 --> 00:29:50.791
MARISHA: Nott, you should hide.

00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:55.020
LAURA: We should look like we're people that are
peasants or something.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.502
MARISHA: I agree, what's our story?

00:29:56.502 --> 00:30:05.508
TRAVIS: I'm escorting you to the Labenda Swamp.
Right? To retrieve stuff for the crown? For

00:30:05.508 --> 00:30:06.609
Zadash?

00:30:06.609 --> 00:30:12.916
LAURA: No. We needed help because our family is
in the swamp.

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:17.316
ASHLEY: We could say we were helping out-- what
was her name?

00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:24.357
MARISHA: We're just traveling hired hands. We are
going to go to the swamp and look for yard work.

00:30:24.357 --> 00:30:26.101
TRAVIS: You should move the safe.

00:30:26.101 --> 00:30:27.480
SAM: In the swamp?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.887
LAURA: I push the safe off the cart.

00:30:29.887 --> 00:30:31.793
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha and Jester should take the
safe.

00:30:31.793 --> 00:30:32.900
MATT: (horse galloping)

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.621
SAM: Are there any woods or anywhere to hide?

00:30:34.621 --> 00:30:38.618
MATT: It's high grass. The grass off the road
where you guys are standing right now is, for you,

00:30:38.618 --> 00:30:39.707
almost shoulder-high.

00:30:39.707 --> 00:30:41.209
SAM: I'm going to go in the grass.

00:30:41.209 --> 00:30:42.895
MATT: Stealth check.

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:45.606
TALIESIN: I'm just going to sit on the wagon
looking bored.

00:30:45.606 --> 00:30:48.802
LAURA: I just bought it. It's in the bag.

00:30:48.802 --> 00:30:51.512
SAM: 22. Am I still drunk? Do I need to--?

00:30:51.512 --> 00:30:54.929
MATT: No, you've been traveling for half a day
since you left, so you've pretty much sobered up.

00:30:54.929 --> 00:30:57.942
MARISHA: Maybe they can help us fix our wheel.

00:30:57.942 --> 00:30:59.422
TALIESIN: That's my thought.

00:30:59.422 --> 00:31:02.108
LAURA: The good stuff's in my bag. Don't worry.

00:31:02.108 --> 00:31:07.919
MATT: Five horses have now galloped up and slow to
a trot as they come up alongside, loosely circling

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:13.729
the side of your cart, in the direction of where
the legion is. They approach; they are all dressed

00:31:13.729 --> 00:31:21.399
in Righteous Brand full armor, helmets on, blades
or bows slung across the shoulders. One of them

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:22.557
approaches, "Hail!"

00:31:22.557 --> 00:31:24.567
LAURA, TALIESIN, and ASHLEY: Hail.

00:31:24.567 --> 00:31:25.824
MARISHA: Good day.

00:31:25.824 --> 00:31:31.053
MATT: "Apologies. We're going to be crossing the
road here shortly. We may require your patience

00:31:31.053 --> 00:31:32.407
"and shifting--"

00:31:32.407 --> 00:31:35.713
TALIESIN: We have a broken wheel, anyway. We're
not moving at a particular speed at the moment.

00:31:35.713 --> 00:31:37.168
LAURA: Could you help us?

00:31:37.168 --> 00:31:40.472
MATT: "Of course. Just of curiosity, where are you
headed?"

00:31:40.472 --> 00:31:43.065
LAURA: We are headed to this swamp place.

00:31:43.065 --> 00:31:44.412
TALIESIN: We are headed north.

00:31:44.412 --> 00:31:48.881
TRAVIS: Labenda.

00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:50.333
MARISHA: The Labenda Swamp.

00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:56.234
MATT: "Labenda? I wouldn't wish it upon my worst
foe. Well, good luck. I am Captain Maximilian from

00:31:56.234 --> 00:31:57.484
"Druvenlode."

00:31:57.484 --> 00:31:58.960
TALIESIN: Captain?

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.254
LAURA: What does he look like?

00:32:00.254 --> 00:32:10.287
MATT: Through the helmet, you see a well-trimmed
bit of chin facial hair, short, comes from under

00:32:10.287 --> 00:32:13.719
the lip. No mustache, but you can't see if it
continues to the rest of his face.

00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:15.955
LIAM: Where's he from again?

00:32:16.126 --> 00:32:17.212
SAM and MATT: Druvenlode.

00:32:17.212 --> 00:32:18.481
LIAM: Druvenlode.

00:32:18.481 --> 00:32:19.571
LAURA: Load or loat?

00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:20.904
MATT: Druvenlode.

00:32:20.904 --> 00:32:25.061
LAURA: Max Load, got it.

00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:28.373
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

00:32:28.373 --> 00:32:34.307
LIAM: Where are you all headed?

00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:37.325
MATT: I'm going to do a little hashmark every
time.

00:32:37.325 --> 00:32:41.517
LIAM: Just carve it on the back of your DM's
screen like a prisoner.

00:32:41.517 --> 00:32:46.250
MATT: At the end of the campaign, you look at my
side of the Wyrmwood table and it's all these

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.233
horrible marks carved into the wood.

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:50.520
TRAVIS: Like Zsasz from the Batman comics?

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.105
LIAM: Captain, where are you headed en masse like
this today?

00:32:56.105 --> 00:33:01.878
MATT: "Well, it seems that the forces of the
Empire are heading east to keep the rest of you

00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:06.263
"safe. Let me see what we can do."

00:33:06.263 --> 00:33:08.670
TALIESIN and LAURA: Thank you so much.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:12.992
MATT: He turns the horse around and begins to head
on back, three follow him while two stay in the

00:33:12.992 --> 00:33:18.301
area. Not close to you, but holding down the fort,
keeping an eye on the road and look behind.

00:33:18.301 --> 00:33:20.702
SAM: Do either of them have saddlebags?

00:33:20.702 --> 00:33:21.964
MATT: They both do.

00:33:21.964 --> 00:33:30.449
SAM: Can I do a little Mage Hand-y? A little
fishing in the one that's closest to me?

00:33:30.449 --> 00:33:32.918
MATT: You very well may. Make a sleight of hand
check.

00:33:32.918 --> 00:33:34.707
LIAM: Do any of us see this?

00:33:34.707 --> 00:33:37.644
TALIESIN: This can't possibly end poorly.

00:33:37.644 --> 00:33:39.020
SAM: 24.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:44.435
MATT: None of you see this, especially not him or
his horse.

00:33:44.435 --> 00:33:47.581
MARISHA: You included the horse.

00:33:47.581 --> 00:33:49.698
MATT: Horses notice things.

00:33:49.698 --> 00:33:54.191
TRAVIS: Fuck you, horse.

00:33:54.191 --> 00:34:03.708
MATT: The saddlebag flips open gingerly, then
reaches in and a small pouch, relatively heavy,

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:08.289
slips out and makes its way over to you and into
your grasp.

00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:11.138
SAM: I hold on to it. Can I peek inside?

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:14.042
MATT: You do. It is filled with dry oats and
corn.

00:34:14.042 --> 00:34:16.314
SAM: It's a good one.

00:34:16.314 --> 00:34:23.917
TRAVIS: Bunch of little things. Can we ask you--
are you familiar with the Labenda Swamp?

00:34:23.917 --> 00:34:29.520
MATT: The captain has ridden off, so one of the
two other people that are there-- you now look

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:35.184
within the armor. One is male and one is female,
and the female soldier turns to you. She has a

00:34:35.184 --> 00:34:41.724
tense stare and a broad-shouldered look as she
turns in your direction. "I've never been, but I

00:34:41.724 --> 00:34:43.924
"hear it's pretty shitty."

00:34:43.924 --> 00:34:48.814
TRAVIS: Seems the same as what he just said,
we're not quite sure what to expect. Any tales or

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.434
stories you can share?

00:34:50.434 --> 00:34:57.095
MATT: "From what I've heard, at the very least,
it's not very comfortable, but people seem to

00:34:57.116 --> 00:35:02.120
"like it and live there still. It's one of the
older provinces in the empire, that I know. Not

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.153
"for me."

00:35:04.153 --> 00:35:06.923
LIAM: Would you rather be headed there or where
you're heading?

00:35:06.923 --> 00:35:15.027
MATT: "That's not really a question,
unfortunately. In times of war, we go where we're

00:35:15.027 --> 00:35:20.825
"needed. We're needed to the east so that you don't
have to go and wade into the battlefield

00:35:20.825 --> 00:35:22.201
"yourselves."

00:35:22.201 --> 00:35:24.263
LAURA: How long have you been a soldier?

00:35:24.263 --> 00:35:28.773
MATT: "This will be my eighth circle."

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:31.896
MARISHA: Have you seen the frontline before?

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:40.899
MATT: "I've not, I'm both terrified and eager. You
know, you daydream of glory and then, who knows

00:35:40.899 --> 00:35:47.875
"once you get there. But I get the sense that
you've seen your fair share of battle in your day,

00:35:47.875 --> 00:35:54.884
"right?" Looks right towards Yasha, this hulking
woman with a giant two-handed greatsword on her back.

00:35:54.884 --> 00:36:06.315
TRAVIS: (high-pitched pigeon voice) Stop smiling!
Anything else but that!

00:36:06.315 --> 00:36:13.517
MATT: At this point, another series of clomping
catches up to you, and you can see the captain's

00:36:13.517 --> 00:36:20.920
returned with two men who are in similar colors
as the Righteous Brand regiment, but not in armor.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.609
They carry large packs on their side, and you can
hear the jangling of metal implements inside. One

00:36:26.609 --> 00:36:36.459
of them has pieces of wood, some strips. They get
off the horse, and at this the captain goes, "Right,

00:36:36.459 --> 00:36:43.215
"there's the cart. Do your business. We're going
to do our best to help you get back to the road, friends."

00:36:43.353 --> 00:36:44.520
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Thanks, captain.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.835
LAURA: Thank you so much for your help.

00:36:45.835 --> 00:36:51.559
MATT: "Of course." The two gentlemen go over and
start giving each other commands. "Lift up

00:36:51.683 --> 00:36:53.071
"there." One of them pulls it up.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:54.793
LAURA: Do you need any help?

00:36:54.793 --> 00:37:00.043
MATT: "By all means, if you have the-- right,
then." Jester's now holding the whole cart up by

00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:08.518
herself. They get down, pull the wheel off and
begin to bend it back into place. One of them goes

00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:14.325
through a small pack of various pieces of wood,
some that appear to have been soaked and are somewhat

00:37:14.419 --> 00:37:20.568
pliable. Ends up replacing the broken wood,
nailing it in place. Just to be safe, they take

00:37:20.568 --> 00:37:25.730
some rope and tie it over the wheel very taut to try
and hold the bent wood. "This should get you at

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:30.442
"least to town. I can't guarantee it will last you
for a long journey, but I recommend a replacement

00:37:30.442 --> 00:37:31.710
"once you get there."

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.671
LAURA: Thank you so much.

00:37:32.671 --> 00:37:36.965
MATT: "Of course. Come on." They get back on their
horses and they ride back. At this point, the

00:37:36.965 --> 00:37:41.335
regiment has now crossed over the road, and you
can now see hundreds of soldiers going across the

00:37:41.335 --> 00:37:50.420
Byway. The captain gives a nod, puts his helmet
back on. "Well, I wish you all luck. Stay safe and

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:54.980
"I hope that if luck is kind to us, we'll cross
paths again."

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.753
LIAM: Stay safe as well. Thank you.

00:37:58.753 --> 00:38:00.217
LAURA: Stay safe.

00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:01.364
SAM: Bye.

00:38:01.364 --> 00:38:02.941
LAURA: Everybody be safe.

00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:11.739
MATT: They turn around and they make their way
back up to the rest of the army. About 25 minutes

00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:16.873
or so it takes for the group of soldiers to
finally cross over the path.

00:38:16.873 --> 00:38:18.903
LAURA: Actually it was faster than I expected.

00:38:18.903 --> 00:38:24.347
MATT: Yeah, it wasn't a huge army, per se. Not as
big as the one you saw leaving Zadash. In total,

00:38:24.347 --> 00:38:26.888
it might have been, maybe, 1000 soldiers.

00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:28.888
TALIESIN: The Kiss army, basically.

00:38:28.888 --> 00:38:41.098
MATT: Now that the way is opened, your cart seems to
have been temporarily repaired. You make your way your way

00:38:41.214 --> 00:38:43.844
back onto the road and continue your heading
north.

00:38:43.974 --> 00:38:46.583
LAURA: Could I try Mending again and see if what
they did made it to where I can fix it now?

00:38:46.583 --> 00:38:52.033
MATT: Sure, I'll say for the purposes of this,
make a wisdom check.

00:38:52.033 --> 00:38:54.762
LAURA: Oh, no I'm wise.

00:38:54.762 --> 00:38:59.847
TALIESIN: That's the most insane roll I've ever
seen.

00:38:59.847 --> 00:39:04.922
LAURA: 23. Wait, that's a lie, that was a save.
20.

00:39:04.922 --> 00:39:08.767
MATT: There you go. Because you were so close, you
were able to see all of the points in which they

00:39:08.767 --> 00:39:16.751
attempted to repair the wheel and now that they've
closed the gap on what is currently cracked and on

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:22.831
the verge of collapsing if this fix wasn't
centered around it, you manage to concentrate and

00:39:22.946 --> 00:39:24.108
with that each one of the--

00:39:24.108 --> 00:39:25.524
LAURA: Traveler be with us.

00:39:25.524 --> 00:39:29.561
MATT: You watch as the wood refixes itself and
becomes a solid wheel.

00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:31.176
LAURA: Ta-da.

00:39:31.176 --> 00:39:33.147
TRAVIS: That's very handy, Jester.

00:39:33.147 --> 00:39:34.122
LAURA: Thank you.

00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.180
ASHLEY: Very cool.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.246
LIAM: Good trick.

00:39:36.246 --> 00:39:37.889
MARISHA: It's fitting that the Traveler helps fix
a wheel.

00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:38.851
SAM: Amazing.

00:39:38.851 --> 00:39:39.790
LAURA: Right?

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:40.732
MARISHA: It's very poetic.

00:39:40.732 --> 00:39:41.527
LAURA: Yes.

00:39:41.527 --> 00:39:42.605
MARISHA: I like it.

00:39:42.605 --> 00:39:44.983
LAURA: You see that, Caleb, that's almost as
powerful as the shit that you do.

00:39:44.983 --> 00:39:51.964
SAM: Let's not get crazy, what he can do is
incredible. Have you seen him in action?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.590
LAURA: Have you seen my lollipop?

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.406
MARISHA: She did just lift up the carriage.

00:39:56.406 --> 00:40:02.334
SAM: Oh yes, she's super strong, yeah. Just
her magic, there's no--

00:40:02.456 --> 00:40:04.987
LAURA: Don't make me Inflict Wounds on you, Nott.

00:40:04.987 --> 00:40:07.627
TALIESIN: There's nothing that's being said here
that can't be said at full momentum.

00:40:07.766 --> 00:40:09.236
SAM: Oh no, are going to ring a bell in my head?

00:40:09.236 --> 00:40:14.625
MATT: With that, the cart lurches forward. You all
have to catch up real fast to scamper back onto

00:40:14.625 --> 00:40:20.135
the cart as Molly has picked it up again. You get
yourself back on the road and heading northward.

00:40:20.135 --> 00:40:21.663
LAURA: Yeah!

00:40:21.663 --> 00:40:26.441
MATT: Keeping watch, for the rest of the way,
eventually the sun comes close to setting and you

00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:32.866
haven't quite gotten within visual range of the
swamp. You're coming to a relatively hilly portion of

00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:38.921
the terrain and ahead most of the valley tends to
cruise upward where the hills are now cresting and

00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:44.686
obscuring the horizon. But the sun is setting, so
you may be looking somewhere to camp, unless you

00:40:44.686 --> 00:40:46.080
want to push through the night.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:51.273
LIAM: I think we should camp, because then we
will hit this swamp at a more advantageous

00:40:51.292 --> 00:40:52.435
moment.

00:40:52.435 --> 00:40:55.979
TRAVIS: Let's see if we can find a rise on one of
these hills to camp on the top.

00:40:56.078 --> 00:40:59.409
MARISHA: Hey Fjord, have you had any more weird
dreams?

00:40:59.409 --> 00:41:02.140
TRAVIS: No, very peaceful, actually.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:13.892
MARISHA: Are your dreams affected by the weather?
Like if it's cold, do you throw up ice shards

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.108
instead of salt water or something?

00:41:16.108 --> 00:41:18.764
TRAVIS: No.

00:41:18.764 --> 00:41:20.115
MARISHA: Because that can be cool.

00:41:20.115 --> 00:41:22.167
TRAVIS: Yeah, I could see how that would appear
that way.

00:41:22.167 --> 00:41:23.397
LAURA: And kind of painful, probably.

00:41:23.397 --> 00:41:26.631
TRAVIS: More that. It hasn't happened that
frequently.

00:41:26.631 --> 00:41:27.728
MARISHA: Okay.

00:41:27.728 --> 00:41:31.310
TRAVIS: Yeah, but not yet. If it does, I'll let
you know.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.658
LIAM: How frequent is it?

00:41:32.658 --> 00:41:36.874
TRAVIS: It's only happened a couple of times,
honestly.

00:41:36.874 --> 00:41:40.037
LIAM: A couple of times you have spit out
seawater?

00:41:40.037 --> 00:41:47.056
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, just the once, actually.

00:41:47.056 --> 00:41:52.576
MARISHA: We don't know if it's seawater, though,
right? It could be like saline.

00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:54.044
LIAM: Saline solution?

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:56.589
SAM: Do you wear contacts?

00:41:56.627 --> 00:42:01.413
LIAM: Hey, you're not supposed to drink that
stuff. It's for rinsing.

00:42:01.517 --> 00:42:10.529
TRAVIS: I don't abide by the rules. I walk my own
path. Like a twister, I was born to walk alone.

00:42:10.643 --> 00:42:13.695
MARISHA: Maybe that's your problem this whole
time.

00:42:13.695 --> 00:42:17.234
TRAVIS: Fuck the rules. Give me saline or give me
death.

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:20.565
MATT: Smash cut to Fjord's grave.

00:42:20.565 --> 00:42:22.418
LAURA: Well, shit.

00:42:22.418 --> 00:42:24.132
TALIESIN: We gave him saline.

00:42:24.132 --> 00:42:27.789
LIAM: This week's episode brought to you by Bausch
&amp;amp; Lomb.

00:42:27.898 --> 00:42:37.494
MATT: As you continue up towards this particular
hillcrest, there is a small patch of high bushes

00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:44.058
in an older campsite. There is a clearing of the
grass, where it's mostly rock and dirt with some

00:42:44.058 --> 00:42:49.972
bits of dried brush. There's a rock formation,
with a bit of charcoal and blackened ground where

00:42:49.972 --> 00:42:52.105
a fireplace had previously been set.

00:42:52.105 --> 00:42:54.746
TALIESIN: This will do just perfectly. Let's do
this.

00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:56.109
TRAVIS: Let's set it up.

00:42:56.109 --> 00:43:00.981
MATT: You guys bring the cart off to the side, set
up your evening arrangement, light a small fire

00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:04.111
there in that same rock circle. Who's taking first
watch?

00:43:04.111 --> 00:43:05.891
LIAM: Silver thread around the fire.

00:43:05.891 --> 00:43:07.138
TRAVIS: I'll take first.

00:43:07.138 --> 00:43:08.737
TALIESIN: I'll join.

00:43:08.737 --> 00:43:14.633
MATT: One of you make the watch roll with
advantage, as the other is giving aid.

00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:20.549
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:31.577
MATT: Nice. In the vicinity, as the dark night
takes over, there is no moonlight, it is very

00:43:31.577 --> 00:43:40.458
dark. But you do catch a flash in the distance.
(rumbling) And another.

00:43:40.458 --> 00:43:47.290
TALIESIN: One-one thousand, two-one thousand,
three-one thousand. Is it getting closer?

00:43:47.311 --> 00:43:49.983
MATT: You listen for a while and it is getting
closer.

00:43:49.983 --> 00:43:53.814
MARISHA: Are we exposed? Like, out?

00:43:53.814 --> 00:43:55.035
MATT: You guys are out in the open, yeah.

00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:57.090
TRAVIS: We're at the top of a rise, so we can see
really well.

00:43:57.128 --> 00:43:59.305
TALIESIN: We're going to get rained on.

00:43:59.305 --> 00:44:01.804
MARISHA: Can we all huddle under the--

00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:03.973
LAURA: You're not awake.

00:44:04.105 --> 00:44:05.522
MARISHA: I mean, (snoring)

00:44:05.522 --> 00:44:06.833
TRAVIS: I don't mind rain.

00:44:06.833 --> 00:44:13.595
TALIESIN: Do we have anything-- We don't have
actual tents, do we? We don't have proper tents?

00:44:13.595 --> 00:44:18.970
MATT: Not unless any of you have it within your pack,
but otherwise all you have is your cart.

00:44:18.997 --> 00:44:20.648
LAURA: This is why we should have taken that circus
tent, man.

00:44:20.813 --> 00:44:23.672
TRAVIS: I have an idea, let's carve the bellies
out of the horses, and we climb inside.

00:44:23.779 --> 00:44:25.504
SAM: So that we don't get wet?

00:44:25.504 --> 00:44:26.435
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:44:26.435 --> 00:44:27.696
MARISHA: Full tauntaun style.

00:44:27.696 --> 00:44:31.171
LAURA: Are there any caves nearby? I mean, we're
kind of by a thing?

00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:38.149
MATT: You're in the middle of a field right now.
It's hilly terrain and the topography shifts a

00:44:38.149 --> 00:44:43.500
bit, but right now all you see is darkness beyond
your immediate darkvision peripheral.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.147
TRAVIS: We're going to get wet.

00:44:45.147 --> 00:44:46.976
LIAM: How many of us can fit under that cart, I
wonder.

00:44:46.976 --> 00:44:48.626
TRAVIS: Even then, the ground's going to get--

00:44:48.626 --> 00:44:50.130
LIAM: Disgusting.

00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:51.501
MARISHA: Soaking.

00:44:51.501 --> 00:44:54.119
MATT: The occasional flash of light you see in the
distance begins to frame an ominous shape far to

00:44:54.119 --> 00:45:01.085
the north: the beginnings of a mountain range that
you have been able to see previously or hadn't

00:45:01.085 --> 00:45:03.727
paid attention with the darkening sky.

00:45:03.765 --> 00:45:06.516
LAURA: Did you guys wake us up because of the
storm, I'm assuming?

00:45:06.516 --> 00:45:08.723
TRAVIS: I think the storm's going to wake you up
soon enough.

00:45:08.723 --> 00:45:14.122
MATT: And it does. Those who are taking the first
part of your evening's rest come to as the storm

00:45:14.122 --> 00:45:19.188
begins to come over. The weather gets colder, you
feel the rain imminent within the next hour.

00:45:19.292 --> 00:45:22.356
MARISHA: I was curious of that too.

00:45:22.356 --> 00:45:24.235
LAURA: What is he looking for?

00:45:24.235 --> 00:45:25.220
SAM: The map.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.345
LAURA: Oh, it's right there.

00:45:26.345 --> 00:45:27.743
SAM: (singing) Get out the map!

00:45:27.743 --> 00:45:30.052
MARISHA: How close are we to the Xhorhasian
border?

00:45:30.052 --> 00:45:32.216
LAURA: We're pretty far away.

00:45:32.216 --> 00:45:36.597
LIAM: We're going here.

00:45:36.597 --> 00:45:40.978
TRAVIS: These are not explosions, orange or red?

00:45:40.978 --> 00:45:43.636
MATT: No, these were lightning bolts in the
distance in the storm.

00:45:43.636 --> 00:45:46.280
MARISHA: Oh there's Druvenlode! There's Max Load.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:52.761
LIAM: Silberquel Ridge, perhaps? Hupperdook is
beyond that mountain range.

00:45:52.761 --> 00:45:57.664
LAURA: Does that mean that guy was named after a
whole city?! Does that means he owns a city?

00:45:57.664 --> 00:46:00.719
MATT, TRAVIS, and LIAM: He was from Druvenlode.

00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:03.619
LAURA: Oh, I thought that was his last name.

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:05.423
SAM: His name was Captain Maximilian.

00:46:05.423 --> 00:46:12.552
MARISHA: I mean, if he was taking the Leonardo da
Vinci approach then it could be accurate. Max of Lode!

00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:18.034
TRAVIS: Hmm. I think we just need to hunker down.

00:46:18.034 --> 00:46:21.248
LAURA: I'll take the next watch because I don't
mind the rain.

00:46:21.248 --> 00:46:23.401
MATT: The rain begins to kick in your vicinity.

00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:24.997
ASHLEY: I'll take next watch, too.

00:46:24.997 --> 00:46:26.601
MATT: The fire begins to go out.

00:46:26.601 --> 00:46:28.484
TALIESIN: I'm getting underneath the cart.

00:46:28.484 --> 00:46:29.737
SAM: Me too!

00:46:29.737 --> 00:46:32.841
MARISHA: I'm going to get on the cart and try and
put my cloak over me.

00:46:32.841 --> 00:46:39.274
MATT: Okay, the cloak you have is treated with
simple wax to try and resist most water. You'll

00:46:39.274 --> 00:46:42.226
probably be a bit soggy in the morning, but it's
doable.

00:46:42.355 --> 00:46:44.201
TRAVIS: I'm staying up. I like the rain.

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:50.284
MARISHA: I look at Molly underneath me on the cart
and I fart a little bit. Just a little.

00:46:50.284 --> 00:46:52.142
SAM: I'm down here, too!

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:54.174
(farting noise)

00:46:54.174 --> 00:46:56.952
TRAVIS: Not a little one. Don't gamble on those.

00:46:56.952 --> 00:46:58.754
MATT: Alcohol and beef jerky, man.

00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:00.436
TALIESIN: At least I'll definitely notice the
smell like fucking roses.

00:47:00.436 --> 00:47:02.254
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:07.789
MATT: The first watch goes beyond the rain without
incident. Who is taking the second watch?

00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:14.090
LIAM: It is a big group of us, yeah? Is there
enough people left over to do the last watch?

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:15.922
ASHLEY: I'll take last.

00:47:15.922 --> 00:47:19.887
MATT: Well, there's only been the first watch.

00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:23.077
TRAVIS: Which was Molly and I, next one is Caleb
and Jester.

00:47:23.077 --> 00:47:30.485
MATT: Okay, I didn't hear that part. So Caleb
and Jester, who's keeping up? Who's the point man

00:47:30.602 --> 00:47:31.526
on that watch?

00:47:31.526 --> 00:47:32.946
LIAM: Oh, your eyesight is better than mine.

00:47:32.946 --> 00:47:35.614
MATT: Make your check.

00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:37.511
LAURA: Just regular plain old check?

00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:40.306
MATT: At this point it's midnight, so it's pitch
black.

00:47:40.306 --> 00:47:44.568
LAURA: That's not bad. 19.

00:47:44.568 --> 00:47:52.883
MATT: You keep watch throughout the area, now
without the warm glow of the fire to give you a

00:47:52.883 --> 00:47:58.215
good visual perspective. All you can go by are the
distant flashes and sometimes close flashes of

00:47:58.215 --> 00:48:04.117
lightning. (thunder) A loud one hits, probably
striking a tree no more than two or three miles

00:48:04.201 --> 00:48:10.589
from where you are. All of you get jostled awake
for a moment before getting yourself back to sleep.

00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:12.501
LAURA: Big one, did you see that?

00:48:12.501 --> 00:48:16.433
MATT: If I could have everybody leave the table
except for Yasha, please.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.214
SAM: What?!

00:48:18.214 --> 00:48:19.581
LIAM: The storm!

00:48:19.581 --> 00:48:24.323
LAURA: Shit! Storm!

00:48:24.323 --> 00:48:25.638
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:48:25.638 --> 00:48:34.715
(yelling)

00:48:40.645 --> 00:48:50.215
MATT: As much as everyone else is attempting and
jostling around to get rest through the night's

00:48:50.235 --> 00:48:56.094
weather, there's something comforting about the
sound of rolling thunder to you. Always kind of

00:48:56.094 --> 00:49:05.398
has been, but more so in recent years. As
unconsciousness comes to you, what usually means

00:49:05.398 --> 00:49:13.196
dreamless sleep. Welcome to be dreamless because
not all dreams are good for you. Not all memories

00:49:13.196 --> 00:49:23.327
are good for you. But as the dark takes you,
there's a flash of light, the sound of thunder,

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:30.935
and there's a vision. A memory of people all
around you, but faced away. People you know,

00:49:30.935 --> 00:49:41.047
people you grew up with, all looking the opposite
direction. It fades to dark. There's another flash

00:49:41.047 --> 00:49:50.848
and you've pushed through them and you see an
elevated piece of ground in the central rock in

00:49:50.848 --> 00:50:02.354
the shape of a figure, but you can't see it. It's
obscured by the low light. You do know who that

00:50:02.354 --> 00:50:13.404
shape is. It goes to dark. It stays dark for a
while, to the point where you are longing for that

00:50:13.404 --> 00:50:21.217
next vision, clamoring for it. You feel this
searing pain burning up each of your arms. You

00:50:21.217 --> 00:50:29.134
look down, but can see nothing except for flames
curling up the side. Dull bluish purple flames

00:50:29.134 --> 00:50:37.548
that create the outline of your forearms. It burns
up to the tips of your fingers. Flash once more

00:50:37.548 --> 00:50:55.026
and around you are bodies. Creatures, people,
children, monsters, dozens and dozens of corpses

00:50:55.026 --> 00:51:01.014
carved and torn asunder. Where you saw the blue
flame up your arm you just see blood, dripping,

00:51:01.014 --> 00:51:09.961
fresh, crimson onto the ground. The only sound you
hear. Your vision fades to darkness once more.

00:51:09.961 --> 00:51:25.958
(thunder) Another blast and there you see it: the
ruined statue. The one beacon of nameless hope

00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:37.938
that pulled you out of that darkness. Missing part
of its torso, the head mostly cleaved, akilter.

00:51:37.938 --> 00:51:46.472
The land seemingly ejecting the presence of what
this statue represents. Your eyes look down and

00:51:46.472 --> 00:51:53.003
focus at the base and as the vision begins to fade
to black once more, your eyes focus on that single

00:51:53.003 --> 00:52:06.167
disc: the four bolts of lightning. The darkness
takes you once more. The next flash (thunder)

00:52:06.167 --> 00:52:20.944
hits, and you're just walking. Your lips are
parched. Your muscles ache. You look over your

00:52:20.944 --> 00:52:31.177
shoulder and you see before you the memory of the
land where you grew up. The waste beyond the

00:52:31.177 --> 00:52:41.496
central swamp of Xhorhas. But it is crawling with
thousands and thousands of worms. From this

00:52:41.496 --> 00:52:48.527
perspective it looks like it's so small. But for
these worms to be where they are, they would be so

00:52:48.527 --> 00:52:54.266
immense at this distance. The perspective is
almost dizzying and you look away. You glance up

00:52:54.266 --> 00:53:05.000
back at that mountain and in spite of that pain,
you continue to push. The vision fades and this

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:16.102
time the darkness lingers. Confusion wells in,
the desperation for something. It's not fair. It's

00:53:16.102 --> 00:53:24.415
not fair to be given just a few glimpses and no
opportunity, no chance. How do you make this

00:53:24.415 --> 00:53:35.155
right? What do you make right? What did you do?
What is there? (thunder) One final, loud,

00:53:35.155 --> 00:53:47.585
shattering, shaking flash of light and rolling
thunder brings to you one singular vision of a

00:53:47.585 --> 00:53:54.600
figure in the dark center of a storm cloud
swirling. The wind buffets your shoulders with

00:53:54.600 --> 00:54:00.591
freezing air. You feel your hair being whipped and
thrown around your face, stinging as it slaps

00:54:00.591 --> 00:54:10.907
against your cheeks and eyes. The same figure,
that statue that had pulled you from the darkness

00:54:10.907 --> 00:54:22.626
once before, stands made of the same roaring and
roiling clouds and rain and wind, stepping out of

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:31.439
the sky towards you. You can see the muscle-bound
form, the gray flesh, formless yet solid as it

00:54:31.439 --> 00:54:38.065
steps down like a titan from the sky. The foot
lands but a quarter-mile from where you stand,

00:54:38.065 --> 00:54:50.439
but the impact causes the ground beneath you to
quake. (thunder) You strangely feel comfort. You

00:54:50.439 --> 00:54:57.839
can't look away from this figure. As the hand
comes down and gently rests on the ground before

00:54:57.839 --> 00:55:08.382
you, before it turns upward to a palm, a
sourceless voice comes into your head, a voice

00:55:08.382 --> 00:55:14.389
you've never heard. For all that you've chased
this mystery, what this beacon is, this is the first

00:55:14.389 --> 00:55:31.837
time you've heard a voice through this imagery.
All it says is, "You walk the right path. Be

00:55:31.837 --> 00:55:50.883
"strong. Don't forget who you were, and decide who
you will become." The vision fades back into

00:55:50.883 --> 00:56:01.503
darkness. (thunder) Another blast of thunder and
this time you wake up suddenly. The rain is still

00:56:01.503 --> 00:56:11.450
pouring outside. You're amongst the grass. Can we
get everybody else back in, please?

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:23.343
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. Holy moly.

00:56:23.343 --> 00:56:32.618
MATT: You wake up. You're shivering a bit from the
cold and the night air. The ground has dampened,

00:56:32.618 --> 00:56:35.176
even beneath the cart. You were sleeping beneath
the cart, right?

00:56:35.176 --> 00:56:37.009
ASHLEY: Near it.

00:56:37.009 --> 00:56:38.568
TRAVIS: Did she go back to New York?!

00:56:38.568 --> 00:56:39.622
ASHLEY: I'm here!

00:56:39.622 --> 00:56:41.140
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:48.406
MARISHA: That would be fucked up, if you used that
as your exit. Wait, where-- what do you mean

00:56:48.406 --> 00:56:49.906
Ashley left?

00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:52.934
MATT: You forgot to say goodbye. She's just gone.

00:56:52.934 --> 00:56:55.495
LIAM: (singing) Never say goodbye!

00:56:55.495 --> 00:57:00.785
SAM: So was she a Xhorhasian spy and are we all
dead in our sleep?

00:57:00.785 --> 00:57:03.692
MATT: Roll a perception check-- no.

00:57:03.692 --> 00:57:07.787
TRAVIS: Is it water or blood that we're covered
in?

00:57:07.787 --> 00:57:15.784
MATT: As you come to consciousness through this
evening's rest for your final watch, as you gather

00:57:15.784 --> 00:57:22.258
after that sleep is probably not going to find its
way to you again for the rest of the evening. Who

00:57:22.258 --> 00:57:23.775
is taking the final watch with you?

00:57:23.775 --> 00:57:27.651
LIAM: Oh man, Jester and I talked about
everything. Like, everything. About childhood,

00:57:27.651 --> 00:57:32.021
favorite kind of ice cream. We know everything
about each other now.

00:57:32.021 --> 00:57:33.947
TALIESIN: Pistachio or Rocky Road?

00:57:33.947 --> 00:57:37.996
LIAM: I'm going to mull it over in my sleep, good
night.

00:57:37.996 --> 00:57:41.292
TRAVIS: Third watch is going to be either Yasha
and Nott, or Yasha and Beau.

00:57:41.292 --> 00:57:43.111
SAM: I'll take it.

00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:48.377
MATT: One of you two make the watch perception
roll.

00:57:48.377 --> 00:57:50.262
SAM: You can do it.

00:57:50.262 --> 00:57:52.191
MATT: Just make a single roll.

00:57:52.191 --> 00:58:03.371
ASHLEY: Okay, eight?

00:58:03.371 --> 00:58:13.295
MATT: As you all rest for the final length of the
evening, Yasha and Nott, you stay up chatting as

00:58:13.295 --> 00:58:17.666
much as you like or staying quiet as much as you
like. The rain still pouring through in sheets

00:58:17.666 --> 00:58:19.009
heavily.

00:58:19.009 --> 00:58:26.991
SAM: How you holding up? Can I go under you? Can
you be like a shelter for me? Like a lean-to?

00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:32.951
ASHLEY: Sure, if you want to get under my hood
here?

00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:34.148
SAM: Wing?

00:58:34.148 --> 00:58:35.881
ASHLEY: Well, it doesn't come out all the time.

00:58:35.881 --> 00:58:37.153
SAM: I don't know how it works.

00:58:37.153 --> 00:58:38.867
ASHLEY: It's just if I get really mad.

00:58:38.867 --> 00:58:45.577
SAM: But your arm is probably big enough to shield
me from the rain. Thank you.

00:58:45.577 --> 00:58:47.401
ASHLEY: Are you dry?

00:58:47.401 --> 00:58:49.703
SAM: Thank you, yes. I don't like to get wet.

00:58:49.703 --> 00:58:55.774
ASHLEY: I feel like I don't know if I want to keep
doing this.

00:58:55.774 --> 00:58:57.382
SAM: That's okay.

00:58:57.382 --> 00:59:04.699
ASHLEY: Okay. Could you give me a moment?

00:59:04.699 --> 00:59:06.308
SAM: Give you a moment?

00:59:06.308 --> 00:59:09.023
ASHLEY: I'm going to go to the tree over there.

00:59:09.047 --> 00:59:10.465
SAM: Do you have to take a piss?

00:59:10.465 --> 00:59:11.569
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:14.524
SAM: All right, I won't look.

00:59:14.524 --> 00:59:15.829
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:19.276
SAM: I look.

00:59:19.276 --> 00:59:23.749
ASHLEY: I go where near the tree was struck close
to us.

00:59:23.749 --> 00:59:29.463
MATT: It's about a quarter-mile walk from where you
are, but you can head there.

00:59:29.463 --> 00:59:32.188
LAURA: That's not that long of a walk, quarter
mile.

00:59:32.188 --> 00:59:37.293
MATT: Yeah, you can get there. A little jaunt down
there. Soaking wet as the rain still pours down.

00:59:37.293 --> 00:59:42.379
You approach and you come to the half-splintered
form of one of the larger trees in this section.

00:59:42.379 --> 00:59:47.314
There are a few dotted singular trees or clusters
around, but this was once a tall and proud tree.

00:59:47.314 --> 00:59:51.782
As you approach, you can see near the top it's been
carved right down the center and part of it has

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:55.726
splintered and exploded. There are chunks of
wood around the vicinity and you can see even

00:59:55.833 --> 01:00:01.528
amongst the rain, on the interior of the exposed
trunk there are still faintly orange glowing

01:00:01.571 --> 01:00:03.793
embers from where the bolt had struck through the
night.

01:00:03.793 --> 01:00:05.784
SAM: (whispered) And a baseball bat.

01:00:05.784 --> 01:00:10.480
MARISHA: (whispered) Lemonade.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:33.219
ASHLEY: I heard you, and I wanted to thank you for
saving me, and I promise you I will be the

01:00:33.392 --> 01:00:49.786
best servant you ever had. Thank you. I'm going to
take a piece of the bark and I'd like to carve the

01:00:49.786 --> 01:00:58.072
symbol into the tree, the Stormlord symbol. Not
very good, but just to have it there.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:01:00.925
MATT: The bark is a harder utensil to utilize to
carve into bark.

01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:04.451
ASHLEY: Sorry, I take a piece of the bark to have
and I use my sword.

01:01:04.451 --> 01:01:10.611
MATT: You can take it and carve in the edge there
using the tip. It takes you a few minutes to do

01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:19.288
so, but you manage to complete the shell of the
symbol's outline and then make your trek back to

01:01:19.288 --> 01:01:20.992
join up with Nott.

01:01:20.992 --> 01:01:29.612
ASHLEY: I got a piece of this bark from that
powerful lightning that struck it.

01:01:29.612 --> 01:01:34.792
SAM: You got bark from a lightning-struck tree?

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:40.218
ASHLEY: Yeah, I wanted to put it in my things. I
like to have things from nature.

01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:43.450
SAM: Do you collect things? I collect things.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.015
ASHLEY: Yeah, I do!

01:01:45.015 --> 01:01:46.777
SAM: What kind of collections do you have?

01:01:46.777 --> 01:02:01.543
ASHLEY: I pull out my book. I mostly put flowers
and things in here because I'm collecting them for

01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:05.783
someone and I want to keep them all in here from
my travels.

01:02:05.783 --> 01:02:10.524
SAM: Oh, it's beautiful! Is it a special someone?

01:02:10.524 --> 01:02:15.893
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:02:15.893 --> 01:02:25.002
SAM: Someone back home? That's so nice.

01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:30.244
ASHLEY: Yeah. But what are the things you
collect?

01:02:30.244 --> 01:02:40.161
SAM: I collect all sorts of things. I have a
button collection. I used to collect stamps, I

01:02:40.161 --> 01:02:49.965
used to collect different kinds of vials of
different sorts of fluids and things like that. I

01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:56.482
collect soles of shoes. Not shoes, just the
soles.

01:02:56.482 --> 01:02:58.485
ASHLEY: Oh, just the bottom bits.

01:02:58.485 --> 01:03:06.150
SAM: Yeah, they come in many different shapes and
sizes. The cobblers throw them away when they're

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:09.427
bad. You can fish them out of the trash and you
can have a whole bunch of them.

01:03:09.427 --> 01:03:11.190
ASHLEY: What do you use them for?

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:15.750
SAM: Nothing. I mean, you can play a little drum
thing with them.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.169
ASHLEY: And should you need to resole your
shoes--

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:24.942
SAM: Sure, if you string them together, they make
a Roman gladiator belt sort of a thing.

01:03:24.942 --> 01:03:28.473
ASHLEY: Have you ever put them one on top of the
other and make a platform shoe?

01:03:28.473 --> 01:03:33.384
SAM: Ooh, I could be a little bit taller! I think
if you put two on top of each other and push them

01:03:33.384 --> 01:03:35.913
in, it looks like lips are talking!

01:03:35.913 --> 01:03:42.178
ASHLEY: Cool! Well.

01:03:42.178 --> 01:03:45.949
SAM: I feel like we've gotten to know each other
so well!

01:03:45.949 --> 01:03:50.428
ASHLEY: Very much so. Do you want to get back
under here?

01:03:50.428 --> 01:03:53.251
SAM: Yes, under your gigantic arm, thank you.

01:03:53.251 --> 01:04:00.858
MATT: As Nott cuddles up alongside Yasha's
comparably hulking form to keep out of the water,

01:04:00.858 --> 01:04:06.043
you finish your final watch as you both watch the
sun begin to rise over the horizon-- or at least,

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:11.172
you can't see the sun, but you can see the day
grows lighter as it makes its way over the cloud

01:04:11.172 --> 01:04:18.136
cover. The rain is not quite as strong, and the
lightning seems to have subsided, but it is still

01:04:18.136 --> 01:04:22.917
a light drizzle when it comes to the proper
morning. As the rest of you come to consciousness,

01:04:22.917 --> 01:04:30.630
completing your long rest, the day is yours, damp
as it may be. The low fog and mist still

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:35.400
encompasses most of the valley around you, and
it's a beautiful sight as you glance around first

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:40.431
thing in the morning. You can see only the tops of
the hills slowly breaking through the layer of

01:04:40.431 --> 01:04:46.320
cold mist that hits the lower valleys between that
shifting topography. As you look off, you can now

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.592
have a much better view of the Silberquel Ridge
above this large mountain range that marks the

01:04:51.592 --> 01:05:06.573
geological center of the empire. As you glance
down, you can barely make out what might be the swamp.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:09.552
LIAM: What's the temperature like right now?

01:05:09.552 --> 01:05:14.001
MATT: It's pretty cold. I'd say it's probably in
the high 40s.

01:05:14.001 --> 01:05:18.284
LIAM: We have to be miserable right now because we
are soaking wet and it is cold.

01:05:18.284 --> 01:05:20.754
TALIESIN: This is not my first time.

01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:22.047
LAURA: Ah, it's like a day at the beach!

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:24.208
MATT: It's not freezing point yet, but it's
definitely cold and wet.

01:05:24.208 --> 01:05:32.093
TALIESIN: Yeah, I miss having a proper tent, and
the wagons were nice. I miss that.

01:05:32.093 --> 01:05:34.843
LAURA: We should get some waxed canvas or
something.

01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:36.456
TALIESIN: Something at least.

01:05:36.456 --> 01:05:39.347
TRAVIS: How'd the rest of the night go? Any
lightning strikes or anything crazy?

01:05:39.347 --> 01:05:41.263
LAURA: There was a big one close by.

01:05:41.263 --> 01:05:42.489
TRAVIS: There was?

01:05:42.489 --> 01:05:44.072
LAURA: It happened right before I went to sleep.

01:05:44.072 --> 01:05:45.572
TRAVIS: Did you see it?

01:05:45.572 --> 01:05:52.511
MATT: Where Molly pointed over there, you see what
was once a tree is destroyed and splintered.

01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:54.304
TRAVIS: That's so rare!

01:05:54.304 --> 01:05:56.074
ASHLEY: It tipped it right over.

01:05:56.074 --> 01:05:58.144
TRAVIS: That's ama-- I mean, right? Lightning
strike?

01:05:58.144 --> 01:05:59.481
LAURA: Don't know.

01:05:59.481 --> 01:06:00.767
SAM: Happens every time it rains.

01:06:00.767 --> 01:06:02.350
TRAVIS: I'm going to run over and look at the
tree.

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:04.412
MATT: It's impressive.

01:06:04.412 --> 01:06:10.779
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can I take some little twigs and
pieces of wood and put it in my little component

01:06:10.779 --> 01:06:11.744
pouch?

01:06:11.744 --> 01:06:13.123
TALIESIN: They're good luck.

01:06:13.123 --> 01:06:14.261
TRAVIS: That's what I've heard.

01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:15.951
TALIESIN: Yeah, tree struck by lightning, very
good luck.

01:06:15.951 --> 01:06:16.919
LAURA: Really?

01:06:16.919 --> 01:06:18.973
TRAVIS: I've only seen it hitting the water and
it's just (explosion).

01:06:19.122 --> 01:06:21.372
MARISHA: I heard it was bad luck. That's what I
was told.

01:06:21.372 --> 01:06:23.199
TALIESIN: It's bad luck for normal people.

01:06:23.199 --> 01:06:24.475
MARISHA: Fuck.

01:06:24.475 --> 01:06:25.972
LAURA: So what kind of people--?

01:06:25.972 --> 01:06:26.949
TALIESIN: Everybody else!

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.264
LAURA: So I should go?

01:06:28.264 --> 01:06:29.146
TALIESIN: Absolutely!

01:06:29.146 --> 01:06:30.670
LAURA: I'm going to go get some of it too!

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:32.022
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:34.575
SAM: Let's take the whole fucking tree!

01:06:34.575 --> 01:06:36.102
TALIESIN: Dig it up!

01:06:36.102 --> 01:06:37.830
(laughter)

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:39.760
MARISHA: Attach it to the back of the horse. Go!

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.580
TRAVIS: Destroy the cart?

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.838
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:06:42.838 --> 01:06:43.683
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:06:43.683 --> 01:06:45.064
TALIESIN: I go over to take a look at it.

01:06:45.064 --> 01:06:48.959
LIAM: I am working on a thing. I have not got it
figured out yet, but I think that I could make

01:06:48.959 --> 01:06:53.921
some sort of shelter for us so that this doesn't
have to happen again. I haven't worked out all

01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:55.647
the-- what?

01:06:55.647 --> 01:06:57.044
SAM: A magical shelter?

01:06:57.044 --> 01:06:58.725
TALIESIN: Or just out of waxed cloth?

01:06:58.725 --> 01:07:00.162
MARISHA: Yeah, how do you mean?

01:07:00.162 --> 01:07:05.818
LIAM: No, magic, of course. But I don't have the--
I've been working on it, but I haven't struck to the--

01:07:05.818 --> 01:07:07.635
SAM: You need more paper?

01:07:07.635 --> 01:07:09.114
MARISHA: You need more incense?

01:07:09.114 --> 01:07:14.442
LIAM: Well, I always need those things, but I need
more time and more research.

01:07:14.442 --> 01:07:18.635
TALIESIN: Well, if you come up with an ingredients
list, we'll be happy to drum stuff up.

01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:21.181
LIAM: Thank you, Mollymauk.

01:07:21.181 --> 01:07:23.723
TALIESIN: Talking about making shelter, that
sounds great.

01:07:23.723 --> 01:07:24.759
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:07:24.759 --> 01:07:26.802
MARISHA: What kind of a shelter?

01:07:26.802 --> 01:07:28.064
LIAM: This sucks.

01:07:28.064 --> 01:07:29.644
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah, it does.

01:07:29.644 --> 01:07:34.769
MARISHA: Like a dome, like a bubble dome? How do
you mean?

01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:44.594
LIAM: I have higher hopes of-- I mean this is a
long ways off, but I would love a large home or a

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:50.952
mansion of some kind that you can (snaps) on a
whim. Doesn't that sound amazing?

01:07:50.952 --> 01:07:53.019
LAURA: That's impossible. You can't make something
like that!

01:07:53.019 --> 01:07:54.841
SAM: Caleb can do it if he sets his mind to it!

01:07:54.841 --> 01:07:57.619
TALIESIN: Like some sort of phantom manor is what
you're speaking of. It would appear--

01:07:57.619 --> 01:08:00.849
ASHLEY: That sounds like that wouldn't be
something that's real.

01:08:00.849 --> 01:08:02.903
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've never heard of anything like
that.

01:08:02.903 --> 01:08:03.973
ASHLEY: Me neither.

01:08:03.973 --> 01:08:05.371
TALIESIN: Doesn't have to be real to be interesting.

01:08:05.371 --> 01:08:07.314
LIAM: We have all of us seen magic in our lives.

01:08:07.314 --> 01:08:09.338
TALIESIN: I like this plan. I'm into it.

01:08:09.338 --> 01:08:10.663
LIAM: Nothing is impossible.

01:08:10.663 --> 01:08:12.603
ASHLEY: But I see from her, you know? She fixed a
wheel.

01:08:12.603 --> 01:08:13.658
LAURA: I fixed a wheel.

01:08:13.658 --> 01:08:14.808
LIAM: That is correct.

01:08:14.808 --> 01:08:16.760
ASHLEY: Naturally, she could make a house next.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.586
LAURA: I could do it because I can make a giant
lollipop.

01:08:19.586 --> 01:08:22.671
LIAM: You have faith, so you should have faith.

01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:25.010
LAURA: I have lots of faith.

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.527
TRAVIS: If you can, Caleb, that would be quite
remarkable.

01:08:28.527 --> 01:08:32.479
LAURA: Is it considered faith if you just really like
somebody?

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:33.735
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

01:08:33.735 --> 01:08:34.859
LAURA: Oh.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:41.083
TRAVIS: Well listen, nothing gets the blood warmed
like movement, so perhaps we should pick up and

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:42.292
get going.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:47.673
TALIESIN: I'm going to, before we take off, take a
look at that tree that got hit. I want to examine

01:08:47.673 --> 01:08:49.354
how it was struck by lightning.

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:50.767
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:08:50.767 --> 01:08:53.064
MARISHA: Beau does pushups while waiting for
Molly.

01:08:53.064 --> 01:08:54.962
MATT: Actually, this would be more of a nature
check.

01:08:54.962 --> 01:08:59.424
TALIESIN: All right, nature. Three.

01:08:59.424 --> 01:09:03.940
MATT: It's struck by lightning, man. Pretty
impressive.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:09.379
TALIESIN: Is this practically like a little bowl
now, or did it split?

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:14.100
MATT: It split, and a lot of the tree is still
standing, but it's broken open from the center,

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.782
and one half of it's broken away and shot off into
multiple pieces.

01:09:17.782 --> 01:09:21.165
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop a piece of silver in
the center so the next person who comes around and

01:09:21.165 --> 01:09:23.162
examines this thing finds a piece of silver.

01:09:23.162 --> 01:09:24.508
MATT: Okay, cool.

01:09:24.508 --> 01:09:29.556
LIAM: Also, Caleb has watched Beauregard go to
town on 100 pushups or something, and I go maybe

01:09:29.556 --> 01:09:38.307
40 feet away and I try as well. I do one pushup,
and then I go study Siff Duthar's spell tome some

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:40.256
more instead of going to two.

01:09:40.256 --> 01:09:43.006
MATT: Fair enough.

01:09:43.006 --> 01:09:44.838
SAM: Are we waiting here for a while?

01:09:44.838 --> 01:09:45.992
LAURA: No.

01:09:45.992 --> 01:09:47.389
MATT: No, you guys are moving on.

01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:50.099
SAM: Oh, we're on a moving cart?

01:09:50.099 --> 01:09:51.268
MATT: You are now.

01:09:51.268 --> 01:09:52.645
LAURA: I want to ride on a horse today!

01:09:52.645 --> 01:09:57.586
MATT: Jester jumps onto one of the horses' backs.
As you guys begin to pick up speed and head down,

01:09:57.586 --> 01:10:04.869
you're now at the very top of this major series of
hill clusters and making your way down towards the

01:10:04.869 --> 01:10:08.042
base of the Silberquel Ridge.

01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:12.530
SAM: As we travel, I'm going to try to make acid.
Probably not a great idea, but I'm going to--

01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:14.845
MATT: Do you have alchemy supplies on you?

01:10:14.845 --> 01:10:19.702
SAM: Yeah, I bought a kit. I've been trying to do
it for a while, but we've never stopped.

01:10:19.702 --> 01:10:30.746
MATT: All right. I would like you to make-- hold
on, it's roll plus proficiency because you're

01:10:30.746 --> 01:10:37.083
proficient in alchemy, plus, this will have to be
dexterity at disadvantage because you're in the

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.332
back of a moving cart.

01:10:38.332 --> 01:10:39.836
TRAVIS: Wooden wheel cart.

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:43.396
SAM: 16 plus proficiency is 19.

01:10:43.396 --> 01:10:44.806
MATT: Correct.

01:10:44.806 --> 01:10:46.232
SAM: But now I roll at disadvantage.

01:10:46.232 --> 01:10:47.762
LIAM: Roll a 20.

01:10:47.762 --> 01:10:50.957
SAM: Nine. That's a 12.

01:10:50.957 --> 01:10:56.435
MATT: You manage to succeed in spite of the-- at
one point, it gets a little dodgy and you almost

01:10:56.435 --> 01:11:02.000
drop it and catch it before it begins to spill the
nearly completed acidic formula all over the

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.476
center of the wooden cart, eating through it.

01:11:04.476 --> 01:11:06.005
TRAVIS: You're making cocktails?

01:11:06.005 --> 01:11:07.050
SAM: Yeah.

01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:13.444
MATT: You manage to complete one vial of acid, so
you can mark that down.

01:11:13.444 --> 01:11:15.107
SAM: One vial of acid, great.

01:11:15.107 --> 01:11:21.210
MATT: As you guys approach the mountain range, you
can see the clouds now that have pressed down

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:27.373
obscure the peaks of the top of the range. You can
see the darkened mountainous form vanishing up

01:11:27.373 --> 01:11:32.155
into the top, gray, whereas in the distance,
sheets of rain that are still coming down much

01:11:32.155 --> 01:11:37.831
heavier to the north obscure your ability to see
further beyond the northward valley to either side

01:11:37.831 --> 01:11:44.324
of the range. You also see the southern base of
the mountains, which is the direction you're

01:11:44.324 --> 01:11:48.651
heading. You get the sense that the watershed--
that most of the mountain range seems to almost

01:11:48.651 --> 01:11:55.768
lean to a southward direction, so the watershed of
all the rain pours and slides down the mountain to

01:11:55.768 --> 01:12:03.766
this one central southern area, and there you see
the darkened, tangled, thick swamp of Labenda,

01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:05.658
your destination.

01:12:05.658 --> 01:12:07.615
LAURA: Ugh, it's going to suck even more because
of this storm.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:12.855
MATT: Sitting deep green and distant, tangled and
sprawling before you.

01:12:12.855 --> 01:12:14.883
LIAM: How far up is it about?

01:12:14.883 --> 01:12:20.101
MATT: From where you are now, I'd say it's eight
or so miles.

01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:21.342
LIAM: Okay.

01:12:21.342 --> 01:12:26.493
LAURA: Hey, at least it's cold so there won't be a
lot of bugs around. Normally, bugs are terrible in

01:12:26.493 --> 01:12:27.607
swamps, I hear.

01:12:27.607 --> 01:12:29.241
TALIESIN: I'd rather be cold than have bugs.

01:12:29.241 --> 01:12:30.077
LAURA: Right?

01:12:30.077 --> 01:12:31.615
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's a very fair point.

01:12:31.615 --> 01:12:42.321
MATT: Continuing your path on for a little bit of
the morning, eventually you begin to watch as the

01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:57.633
grasses begin to give way to more... moistened--
that's a fun word to use, moistened-- terrain. The

01:12:57.633 --> 01:13:06.543
normal dry-- even after a rain, the damp ground
is now becoming sludgy, and the path itself, the

01:13:06.543 --> 01:13:12.574
road, seems to have been well-built and set for
this type of travel. But even then, it's starting

01:13:12.574 --> 01:13:16.742
to gather on the wheels a bit as you ride through,
and you can see bits of it are clustering up and

01:13:16.742 --> 01:13:19.886
leaving this groove in the ground behind you.

01:13:19.886 --> 01:13:25.189
TALIESIN: Who's on a horse? Am I on the cart, or
am I on a horse?

01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:26.590
ASHLEY: I'm on a horse.

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:27.549
TALIESIN: I'll be in the cart then.

01:13:27.549 --> 01:13:28.892
MARISHA: I'll be in the cart.

01:13:28.892 --> 01:13:29.848
LIAM: Cart.

01:13:29.848 --> 01:13:32.453
TALIESIN: I'm going to take one of the swords and
start using the flat of the blade to scrape the

01:13:32.453 --> 01:13:37.236
wheel and give it an edge to start removing the
mud off of it and hop between wheels.

01:13:37.236 --> 01:13:39.626
MATT: Okay, and you move around each one. It
doesn't get too bad, thankfully, because it's

01:13:39.626 --> 01:13:47.109
still pretty slick. When it clumps on, it
generally slides off. It's not immediately damp

01:13:47.109 --> 01:13:49.100
from the first time for most of the vicinity
here.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:55.552
LAURA: Oh no, and if you start to lose hope, your
horse sinks into the mud and it's gone forever.

01:13:55.552 --> 01:13:58.023
TRAVIS: That fucking movie traumatized me.

01:13:58.023 --> 01:14:14.154
MATT: The rain does eventually begin to subside.
However, the edge of the swamp begins to breach

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:19.032
the path that you're heading. You begin to see the
swamp grasses take over from the hillside. You

01:14:19.032 --> 01:14:24.155
begin to see the heavy puddles of swamp bog water
beginning to appear to the right and left. The

01:14:24.155 --> 01:14:28.857
trees you're used to seeing here in the middle of
the field are giving way to banyan trees and other

01:14:28.857 --> 01:14:38.671
thicker-trunked, gnarled bases, heavy, thick
vine-covered canopies. The insects begin to fill

01:14:38.671 --> 01:14:41.155
the air with a weird buzzing.

01:14:41.155 --> 01:14:43.395
LAURA: Oh, I thought there wouldn't be insects
because it's cold!

01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:48.228
LIAM: In addition to the insects, do we start to
become aware of wildlife around? Birds and

01:14:48.228 --> 01:14:49.471
beasts?

01:14:49.471 --> 01:14:52.410
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:55.974
SAM: Do we know anything about where we're going?

01:14:55.974 --> 01:15:00.258
TRAVIS: We're going to see a safe house that the
lights have been out at.

01:15:00.258 --> 01:15:01.938
LAURA: We're trying to find Febron Keyes.

01:15:01.938 --> 01:15:08.625
SAM: Yeah, but it's a big swamp. Are any of us
good at like wood stuff? Is this me? Am I the girl?

01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:15.364
LIAM: I'm good at nature. I've lived in the woods
for a long time.

01:15:15.364 --> 01:15:17.151
MARISHA: I'm okay at surviving.

01:15:17.151 --> 01:15:23.965
MATT: About half an hour or so of travel along the
road into the center of Labenda Swamp, the humid

01:15:23.965 --> 01:15:29.214
air prevents the mounting sweat on your body from
evaporating, causing your sweat to pool in your

01:15:29.214 --> 01:15:36.252
armor in uncomfortable ways. Your breathing is
somewhat shallow as you adapt to the moisture in

01:15:36.252 --> 01:15:42.633
the air around you. The ever-present hum of the
buzzing insects begins to permeate the atmosphere

01:15:42.633 --> 01:15:48.102
around you, while the musky stench of decaying
plants and stagnant water grow stronger the

01:15:48.102 --> 01:15:53.239
further in you pass. A very low fog, since it's
still relatively early in the day, sits across the

01:15:53.239 --> 01:15:58.536
surface of the water that's exposed in patches
between where the thick roots and soft rotting

01:15:58.536 --> 01:16:02.066
vegetation seems to be sitting, like a spongy
ground.

01:16:02.066 --> 01:16:08.166
MARISHA: I'm going to take my staff and poke it in
the marshy bits.

01:16:08.166 --> 01:16:14.983
MATT: As you push down, it sinks a few inches. As
you pull back, the portion that you had pressed in

01:16:14.983 --> 01:16:19.387
remains, but the water begins to fill up the space
where your staff had pushed in.

01:16:19.387 --> 01:16:25.400
LIAM: On the plus side, I think sitting in the
cart, that Caleb is probably the cleanest he has

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.031
been in two years because it's been raining non
stop.

01:16:29.031 --> 01:16:42.673
MATT: You guys continue further into the swamp.
You get about another half hour or so on the path

01:16:42.673 --> 01:16:51.315
before Beauregard, Caleb, Molly and Jester, all at
once, you hear this strange trilled cry of some

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:54.716
kind. It's like, (cawing).

01:16:54.915 --> 01:16:58.592
LIAM: I cast Mage Armor on myself.

01:16:58.592 --> 01:17:00.361
MATT: Mage Armor.

01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:02.905
LAURA: That sounds like it was talking, or did
that sound like a bird?

01:17:02.905 --> 01:17:04.858
TALIESIN: I think that sounded like a bird
talking.

01:17:04.858 --> 01:17:06.914
MARISHA: It sounded like an alert to me.

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:10.251
ASHLEY: I don't think I heard anything.

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:13.516
LAURA: Should we call back?

01:17:13.516 --> 01:17:15.813
TALIESIN: What should we call back?

01:17:15.813 --> 01:17:18.017
MARISHA: (cawing)

01:17:18.017 --> 01:17:21.073
TRAVIS: Okay, that's what we decided to do?

01:17:21.073 --> 01:17:23.899
LIAM: That's not a good idea.

01:17:23.899 --> 01:17:24.927
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:17:24.927 --> 01:17:26.472
MARISHA: Maybe it's a mating call.

01:17:26.472 --> 01:17:28.120
LAURA: Maybe it's just a bird.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.564
TALIESIN: I don't see how that's any better.

01:17:29.564 --> 01:17:38.161
MATT: You hear it again, only this time it sounds
intense, or frantic. The strange (bird croaking).

01:17:38.161 --> 01:17:41.380
MARISHA: Does it sound like multiple, or from the
same source?

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:45.006
MATT: It sounds singular, so far.

01:17:45.006 --> 01:17:47.077
LAURA: Where's it coming from? What area?

01:17:47.077 --> 01:17:50.511
MATT: It's coming to the right, off the road, like
deep into the swamp.

01:17:50.511 --> 01:17:52.341
LAURA: It's over there.

01:17:52.341 --> 01:17:54.210
SAM: Are we going to stop? We're moving?

01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:56.505
MATT: You guys are still moving forward on the
path.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.474
LAURA: Can we look, can we see? Can we see into
the swamp?

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.247
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:18:01.247 --> 01:18:04.131
LAURA: Natural one!

01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:10.902
MATT: As you're glancing out there, a piece of
stray vegetation, falling from one of the nearby

01:18:10.902 --> 01:18:13.285
trees, flitters into your eye.

01:18:13.285 --> 01:18:17.166
LAURA: Ow! I got a leaf-- No, I think it's a
leaf.

01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:18.501
SAM: Use Mending.

01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:20.168
LAURA: I use Mending on my eye.

01:18:20.168 --> 01:18:22.283
MATT: No effect.

01:18:22.283 --> 01:18:27.197
TRAVIS: Now that we've continued on, how do the
wagon wheels look on the road as we're moving? Are

01:18:27.197 --> 01:18:30.440
they leaving tracks that's filling in with water
behind us at this point?

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.851
MATT: Faintly.

01:18:31.851 --> 01:18:34.046
TRAVIS: Not like the staff push, though.

01:18:34.046 --> 01:18:40.275
MATT: No, she was pushing off the path. This road
is designed to not sink heavy with the rest of

01:18:40.275 --> 01:18:45.648
the swamp material. A lot of travel happens in and
out on this main path on the byway. As long as

01:18:45.648 --> 01:18:47.857
you're on the path, for the most part, you should
be fine.

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:51.335
MARISHA: Is this considered the Berleben path?

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:55.924
MATT: This is the path to Berleben. The Bromkiln
Byway is the road you're taking.

01:18:55.924 --> 01:18:59.158
MARISHA: The Bromkiln. So this is not--

01:18:59.158 --> 01:19:00.835
MATT: You're in the swamp.

01:19:00.835 --> 01:19:02.352
SAM: The road goes through the swamp.

01:19:02.352 --> 01:19:03.923
MATT: Yes, and Berleben is further in the swamp.

01:19:03.923 --> 01:19:08.652
LIAM: I would say that Caleb has spent a lot of
time over the last several years in woods. Can I

01:19:08.652 --> 01:19:10.770
check to see if I have ever heard that cry
before?

01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:13.519
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:19:13.519 --> 01:19:17.477
LIAM: That is an 18.

01:19:17.477 --> 01:19:28.908
MATT: It sounds similar to a crow cry, but it
sounds frantic. You've heard the sound similar to

01:19:28.908 --> 01:19:39.217
it before, when you once as a child watched a crow
snatched in the jaws of some sort of hunting cat.

01:19:39.217 --> 01:19:44.891
Right before its bones were crushed and it went
lifeless, it's a very similar sound.

01:19:44.891 --> 01:19:47.936
SAM: That's specific.

01:19:47.936 --> 01:19:49.729
TRAVIS: No movement that we can see, just the
sound?

01:19:49.729 --> 01:19:54.011
MATT: No, just the sound. It's loud enough where
it's not that far off the road, but it's not in

01:19:54.011 --> 01:19:57.848
sight right now. There's too many tree trunks
obscuring your vision.

01:19:57.848 --> 01:19:59.673
TRAVIS: Branch canopies over us at this point?

01:19:59.673 --> 01:20:03.476
MATT: They are, but they're not super thick.
There's still light coming through, and as you

01:20:03.476 --> 01:20:07.215
travel, there are bits and pieces that overhang
the road, but you still have open sky ahead of

01:20:07.215 --> 01:20:10.511
you. You don't think it's going to continue the
further into the swamp you go.

01:20:10.511 --> 01:20:14.308
LAURA: Fjord, will you look at my eye? I think
there's something still in here.

01:20:14.308 --> 01:20:19.744
TRAVIS: Yeah, here, look up. Yeah, you got like a
tree booger in it.

01:20:19.744 --> 01:20:21.309
LAURA: Fjord, get it.

01:20:21.309 --> 01:20:27.873
TRAVIS: Oh, god, this is the worst part. Can I try
and get the boog out of her eye?

01:20:27.873 --> 01:20:29.492
MATT: Roll a dexterity check.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:32.689
SAM: Please be a one. Please be a one. Please be a
one.

01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:36.758
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:20:36.758 --> 01:20:47.331
MATT: With a deft flick of his finger, he
manages to pluck the piece of vegetation from your eye.

01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:49.464
LAURA: Wow! My hero.

01:20:49.464 --> 01:20:50.730
TRAVIS: I got it, Jester.

01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:54.141
LAURA: Thank you Oskar-- I mean Fjord!

01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:58.102
MATT: It gently hits the side of Molly's cheek.

01:20:58.102 --> 01:21:01.544
LIAM: Fjord regurgitates saline solution.

01:21:01.544 --> 01:21:04.641
TRAVIS: I got it, (vomiting).

01:21:04.641 --> 01:21:12.225
LAURA: Yasha starts throwing up.

01:21:12.225 --> 01:21:14.460
ASHLEY: Uh-oh, it's happening again.

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:22.499
MARISHA: Does there appear to be any sign of
wreckage, or anything else that looks like it

01:21:22.499 --> 01:21:26.599
might not have made its way through this path
because of other dangers?

01:21:26.599 --> 01:21:30.014
MATT: You, who have been keeping a discerning eye,
and you rolled what on your perception check before?

01:21:30.014 --> 01:21:32.992
MARISHA: 15, but that was a bit ago.

01:21:32.992 --> 01:21:37.590
MATT: Roll again as you've stopped at this place
here.

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:39.737
MARISHA: That's not as good this time, 12.

01:21:39.737 --> 01:21:47.795
MATT: 12. Something shifts in the water ahead,
almost beyond your vision. Something that was

01:21:47.795 --> 01:21:53.601
stationary before, and looked like a log that had
been resting in the water, dips away from you in

01:21:53.601 --> 01:21:55.269
the direction of the noise.

01:21:55.269 --> 01:21:56.555
MARISHA: Nobody move.

01:21:56.555 --> 01:21:59.099
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently light up one of my
swords.

01:21:59.099 --> 01:22:00.881
MATT: Okay, go ahead and mark that.

01:22:00.881 --> 01:22:05.182
MARISHA: If you're going to move, move onto the
cart.

01:22:05.182 --> 01:22:06.421
SAM: Have we stopped the cart?

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:07.687
LAURA: But we're on horses.

01:22:07.687 --> 01:22:08.991
MARISHA: Are we on horses?

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:10.388
MATT: You guys are still on the path, yeah.

01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:11.612
SAM: Should we stop moving the cart?

01:22:11.612 --> 01:22:14.242
TRAVIS: What did you see? Yeah, we should stop.
What'd you see?

01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:19.285
MARISHA: Something just moved in the water. It
might be able to hear our movements, though.

01:22:19.285 --> 01:22:20.273
LAURA: Was it a snake?

01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:21.407
MATT: It moved away from you.

01:22:21.407 --> 01:22:24.654
MARISHA: It moved away though.

01:22:24.654 --> 01:22:30.547
MATT: It moved in the direction of the sound. You
hear it again (panicked bird croaking).

01:22:30.547 --> 01:22:36.201
LAURA: I really want to see what it is. Oh, you
don't have a bird, you have a cat.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:40.582
ASHLEY: Is this terrain similar at all to
Xhorhas?

01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:47.224
MATT: This terrain is pretty similar to you, yeah.
In places where you grew up, some hunting and some

01:22:47.224 --> 01:22:52.969
places in your nomadic lifestyle put you in
terrain very similar to this. So you're pretty

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:54.122
comfortable here.

01:22:54.122 --> 01:22:55.230
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:22:55.230 --> 01:23:01.797
MARISHA: I take a ball bearing out and toss it and
throw it into the swamp. See what happens.

01:23:01.797 --> 01:23:04.912
MATT: Nothing.

01:23:04.912 --> 01:23:08.521
LAURA: Some poor fish is going to try to eat
that.

01:23:08.521 --> 01:23:13.679
MARISHA: He's probably going to die. Oh man, poor
guy. He'll be fine.

01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:16.334
MATT: What are you guys doing? Anything?

01:23:16.334 --> 01:23:20.529
TRAVIS: I'm going to use Minor Illusion, and about
30 feet away above the water, just above the

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:26.218
surface of it, I'm going to create a little
hummingbird and have it whip back and forth above

01:23:26.218 --> 01:23:27.272
the water.

01:23:27.272 --> 01:23:28.528
TALIESIN: That's clever.

01:23:28.528 --> 01:23:29.841
TRAVIS: Just to see what--

01:23:29.841 --> 01:23:31.516
MATT: Continues for a bit.

01:23:31.516 --> 01:23:33.180
TRAVIS: Move it a little.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.914
MATT: No reaction.

01:23:34.914 --> 01:23:39.143
TRAVIS: Make it disappear. I think we're okay.

01:23:39.143 --> 01:23:41.152
SAM: Should we continue on, or--?

01:23:41.152 --> 01:23:46.243
LAURA: Maybe we should call out and see if Febron
is here.

01:23:46.243 --> 01:23:49.010
SAM: Maybe it's Febron, maybe that's a--

01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:50.645
LAURA: Maybe it's a call.

01:23:50.645 --> 01:23:53.131
LIAM: We're just getting into this swamp right
now, right?

01:23:53.131 --> 01:23:54.961
MATT: Yeah, you're maybe an hour into it.

01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:59.020
MARISHA: Would we know if this is the stretch of
road that they were talking about, that they were

01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.587
having issues with?

01:24:00.587 --> 01:24:06.899
MATT: They were cut off from the safe house. You
don't know where the safe house is, or what

01:24:06.899 --> 01:24:08.155
location it is at.

01:24:08.155 --> 01:24:11.140
LAURA: But the safe house is in the swamp, it's
not in Berleben, right?

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:12.470
MATT: As far as you know, yes.

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:15.272
SAM: We press on.

01:24:15.272 --> 01:24:17.528
TRAVIS: Maybe not calling out.

01:24:17.528 --> 01:24:19.917
LAURA: Maybe we can climb a tree! Are there any
tall trees?

01:24:19.917 --> 01:24:21.455
MATT: There are a number of tall trees.

01:24:21.455 --> 01:24:22.730
LAURA: Can I start climbing a tree?

01:24:22.894 --> 01:24:24.867
MATT: Sure, you want to get a little closer and
climb a tree?

01:24:25.084 --> 01:24:26.057
LAURA: Sure.

01:24:26.057 --> 01:24:34.321
MATT: Make a general athletics check as you jump
off the side, your legs (slurping) into the swamp,

01:24:34.321 --> 01:24:39.486
as they sink about a foot with each step, leaving
these heavy footprints behind that fill with water.

01:24:39.486 --> 01:24:41.721
LAURA: 21.

01:24:41.721 --> 01:24:46.333
MATT: You make your way through the swamp, the
suction doesn't stop you one bit. You grab the

01:24:46.333 --> 01:24:49.656
nearby tree and climb to the top and get off to a
branch and look in the direction. Make a

01:24:49.656 --> 01:24:56.218
perception check, please. That's cocked. How could
you do that?

01:24:56.218 --> 01:25:00.606
LAURA: It was a really good one if it hadn't been.
Perception ten.

01:25:00.606 --> 01:25:05.275
MATT: Ten? That's enough. Over the edge you glance
down and you can see past the tree line, maybe

01:25:05.275 --> 01:25:12.027
about 100 or so feet from where you are, there's a
small clearing, this open area. Where the water

01:25:12.027 --> 01:25:19.848
is, there is a thick bit of black bog. It looks
almost like a thick swampy, tar-ish little pool.

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:27.864
You can see a part of a tree has fallen into it,
and the liquid is generally darkening the bottom

01:25:27.864 --> 01:25:35.054
of where it's been stuck. You don't know how long
it's been there. There is the dark root, and

01:25:35.054 --> 01:25:41.093
crooked branches, and elements of it sticking up
in the air. The smell of bog rot is very strong,

01:25:41.093 --> 01:25:47.602
even from this proximity to it. You see something
moving in the center of this bog, struggling,

01:25:47.602 --> 01:25:53.767
shifting. You see, covered in this tar-like
material and flailing, some sort of humanoid

01:25:53.767 --> 01:26:04.680
creature of jet black skin. It's not skin--
feathers. It's fighting against the swamp, it's

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:12.427
small. Shifting out of the water off to the side,
slowly up to the bog, probably what Beau saw

01:26:12.427 --> 01:26:19.918
earlier, some sort of reptilian creature with a
long snout and a long tail. Curving around and

01:26:19.918 --> 01:26:26.427
making its way slowly towards the bog. As the
flailing bird creature is attempting to give a

01:26:26.427 --> 01:26:27.563
(panicked bird croaking).

01:26:27.563 --> 01:26:29.112
LAURA: I cast Guiding Bolt on the reptilian
creature.

01:26:29.112 --> 01:26:30.191
SAM: How far is it?

01:26:30.191 --> 01:26:32.255
LAURA: It's 120 feet distance and you said that
the bog is 100 feet away.

01:26:32.255 --> 01:26:41.464
MATT: That's true. That was going to be a-- uh-oh,
over here. What's the DC on that?

01:26:41.464 --> 01:26:45.547
LAURA: It's a-- shit, sorry.

01:26:45.547 --> 01:26:47.471
MATT: It's all good.

01:26:47.471 --> 01:26:49.583
LAURA: Guiding Bolt!

01:26:49.583 --> 01:26:52.542
MATT: The DC on any of your spells.

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:54.292
LIAM: It's your proficiency, plus your wisdom,
plus eight.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:56.373
LAURA: Plus seven.

01:26:56.373 --> 01:26:58.412
MATT: Plus seven? It fails. Roll damage.

01:26:58.412 --> 01:27:06.105
LAURA: Okay, ah! 4d6, ah! Eight, ten, 13.

01:27:06.105 --> 01:27:15.155
MATT: 13 points of damage. All of this divine
energy suddenly bursts and burns around the

01:27:15.155 --> 01:27:21.214
creature's body. As it suddenly spins, with this
hiss in the direction, looking around and seeing

01:27:21.214 --> 01:27:22.506
nothing there.

01:27:22.506 --> 01:27:27.139
LAURA: Don't worry, we'll save you! There's a
thing, and it's trapped and there's the reptile

01:27:27.139 --> 01:27:28.737
thing that's going to eat it!

01:27:28.737 --> 01:27:30.353
TRAVIS: Where? Which direction?

01:27:30.353 --> 01:27:32.735
LAURA: Over there. I point and I start climbing
over and try to get to it.

01:27:32.735 --> 01:27:34.499
LIAM: Do we even see her anymore?

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:38.045
MATT: You see her in the tree, you don't see what
she's looking at and pointing at. She climbs down

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:39.673
the tree and begins running in that direction.

01:27:39.673 --> 01:27:41.222
LAURA: It's about 100 feet away. Don't worry.

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:42.676
SAM: Don't worry? What?

01:27:42.676 --> 01:27:43.527
TALIESIN: What?

01:27:43.527 --> 01:27:44.809
MATT: She's ran off.

01:27:44.809 --> 01:27:45.951
SAM: Shit.

01:27:45.951 --> 01:27:47.518
TRAVIS: Fuck. I'll run off after her.

01:27:47.518 --> 01:27:48.687
ASHLEY: Same.

01:27:48.687 --> 01:27:49.822
MARISHA: What are we saving?

01:27:49.822 --> 01:27:51.712
SAM: I don't know. Right now, we're saving
Jester.

01:27:51.712 --> 01:27:56.501
MARISHA: I'm still on a horse, yeah? I'm on a
horse.

01:27:56.501 --> 01:27:59.443
MATT: You are, yeah. You're staying on your horse
to get there?

01:27:59.443 --> 01:28:01.740
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm staying on my horse!

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.172
TRAVIS: You're going to hard tax your horse?

01:28:03.172 --> 01:28:06.476
MARISHA: (galloping) How cool is that?

01:28:06.476 --> 01:28:10.981
MATT: Well, it's cool for the first minute before
it goes (mud slurping).

01:28:10.981 --> 01:28:14.614
LAURA: Guiding Bolt is an attack thing, so I have
to roll to attack.

01:28:14.614 --> 01:28:16.674
MATT: Oh, got you. Roll to attack.

01:28:16.674 --> 01:28:22.739
LAURA: Oh, no. Okay, it definitely hits. It's plus
seven, 16, 23.

01:28:22.739 --> 01:28:25.441
MATT: Yeah, that hits. All right, cool. So
timeline worked out.

01:28:25.441 --> 01:28:26.548
LAURA: Yay!

01:28:26.548 --> 01:28:28.553
MATT: As you approach, this is the visual from the
side that you see.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.999
TRAVIS: Yay, map time!

01:28:30.999 --> 01:28:34.304
LAURA: I'm so glad we checked out what it was.

01:28:34.304 --> 01:28:44.198
TRAVIS: (beatboxing)

01:28:44.198 --> 01:28:45.793
LAURA: Oh shit!

01:28:45.793 --> 01:28:47.235
SAM: So many trees.

01:28:47.235 --> 01:28:49.672
LAURA: Oh my god, look at all these trees.

01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:51.262
TRAVIS: Damn.

01:28:51.262 --> 01:28:57.289
MATT: This here is the gator that you see making
its way there. It is very large.

01:28:57.289 --> 01:29:01.781
LAURA: Oh no, it's really big. Look at that teeny
little bird guy.

01:29:01.781 --> 01:29:07.554
MATT: Jester, you make your way up over to that
side. The rest of you are currently trying to

01:29:07.554 --> 01:29:14.977
catch up on that end of the table. That being the
case, I need everyone to roll initiative.

01:29:14.977 --> 01:29:16.113
SAM: Oh, boy.

01:29:16.113 --> 01:29:22.433
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

01:29:22.433 --> 01:29:27.096
TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:29:27.096 --> 01:29:32.860
SAM: You know what we never do?

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.225
LAURA: What?

01:29:34.225 --> 01:29:36.283
SAM: Tap into our pool of luck.

01:29:36.283 --> 01:29:40.089
LAURA: Ah, shit! Our fate point.

01:29:40.089 --> 01:29:42.240
MARISHA: The thing that we've been hauling
around.

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.971
SAM: Yeah, we never use it. We've never ever used
it. Ever.

01:29:45.971 --> 01:29:47.461
ASHLEY: Wait, using what?

01:29:47.461 --> 01:29:49.426
SAM: You know the dodecahedron thing.

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:50.439
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah.

01:29:50.439 --> 01:29:51.952
LAURA: We have to focus on it in the morning.

01:29:51.952 --> 01:29:53.664
MARISHA: You have to stare at it for a minute.

01:29:53.664 --> 01:29:55.199
MATT: Keep it in mind.

01:29:55.199 --> 01:29:58.763
TALIESIN: I have a thought. I have a coin, and
whoever's holding the coin has that for the day.

01:29:58.763 --> 01:30:01.709
Then we pass it around, so you have this as a
chip.

01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:02.712
LAURA: That's really smart.

01:30:02.712 --> 01:30:05.050
TALIESIN: Obviously we didn't do it this morning,
but from now on.

01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:06.506
LAURA: We'll just say we pass the coin.

01:30:06.506 --> 01:30:08.719
LIAM: Yeah. Luck is for suckers, man.

01:30:08.719 --> 01:30:11.919
TALIESIN: Who wants it for tomorrow? Or for next,
for after the fight?

01:30:11.919 --> 01:30:13.380
MARISHA: For the next eight hours?

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:15.397
MATT: Heading this direction--

01:30:15.397 --> 01:30:17.993
SAM: I'll take it.

01:30:17.993 --> 01:30:19.647
LAURA: Let's hope nobody dies in this fight.

01:30:19.647 --> 01:30:22.459
LIAM: Also, it's important that it is kept
hidden.

01:30:22.504 --> 01:30:25.848
MATT: North is that way. That's the direction you
were traveling was this direction. You're heading

01:30:25.848 --> 01:30:26.918
this way.

01:30:26.918 --> 01:30:27.956
TRAVIS: North is that direction?

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:28.683
LAURA: Yes.

01:30:28.683 --> 01:30:32.838
MATT: Correct. 25 to 20? 20 to 15?

01:30:32.838 --> 01:30:34.533
TALIESIN and MARISHA: 15!

01:30:34.533 --> 01:30:38.447
MARISHA: Man, that's pretty crappy.

01:30:38.447 --> 01:30:47.060
TALIESIN: It's not close enough to really do
anything yet.

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.472
MATT: Beau, you got 15?

01:30:48.472 --> 01:30:49.167
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:30:49.167 --> 01:30:50.049
MATT: Molly, you got 15?

01:30:50.049 --> 01:30:50.998
TALIESIN: Uh-huh.

01:30:50.998 --> 01:30:52.381
TRAVIS: You assume there's only one of them.

01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:55.319
MATT: That brings us to 15 to ten.

01:30:55.319 --> 01:30:56.454
LAURA: 14.

01:30:56.454 --> 01:30:57.629
SAM: 12.

01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:58.735
ASHLEY: 13.

01:30:58.735 --> 01:30:59.999
LIAM: 12 as well.

01:30:59.999 --> 01:31:01.645
MATT: What'd you get, Jester?

01:31:01.645 --> 01:31:02.762
LAURA: 14.

01:31:02.762 --> 01:31:06.092
TRAVIS: Jester, Yasha, Caleb, Nott.

01:31:06.092 --> 01:31:09.900
MATT: 12?

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.156
TRAVIS: Six!

01:31:12.156 --> 01:31:14.449
LIAM and TRAVIS: Big six!

01:31:14.449 --> 01:31:16.660
MATT: You got a six?

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:17.531
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:31:17.531 --> 01:31:18.696
ASHLEY: Oo-wee!

01:31:18.696 --> 01:31:21.200
TRAVIS: Shooter, coming out!

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:29.417
MATT: Beau and Molly, you're up first. At a full
double dash, you can catch up, at this point,

01:31:29.457 --> 01:31:45.914
almost to Jester. It's rough terrain because it's
a swamp. You guys, we'll say, get about there, and

01:31:45.914 --> 01:31:49.787
Molly, you're a little bit behind, because Beau is
a little faster than you.

01:31:49.787 --> 01:31:52.870
TALIESIN: Yeah, sure. She probably did a little
(whooshes).

01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:57.240
MATT: Correct. That's your turn. That gets us to
Jester.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.141
LAURA: I can go?

01:31:59.141 --> 01:32:00.131
MATT: You can go.

01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:03.946
LAURA: Oh gosh. Okay! I'm going to cast Spiritual
Weapon!

01:32:03.946 --> 01:32:06.777
SAM: Dun-dun-dun-dun lollipop!

01:32:06.777 --> 01:32:08.736
ASHLEY: Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!

01:32:08.736 --> 01:32:11.412
MATT: Where are you placing that? 60 feet range?

01:32:11.412 --> 01:32:16.986
LAURA: Oh, shit. That's right. It's a 60 foot
range. How far can I get it? That's true. Oh, I

01:32:16.986 --> 01:32:20.931
guess I can run forward first before I do it. I'm
going to run forward and try to get up on that tree.

01:32:20.931 --> 01:32:25.916
MATT: It's rough terrain against the swamp because
it's very (marshy sloshes).

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:28.936
LAURA: Okay. That's about as far as I can go?

01:32:28.936 --> 01:32:30.242
MATT: As far as you can get, yeah.

01:32:30.242 --> 01:32:35.117
LAURA: Wow. I'm going to stand on that log so I'm
out of the swamp.

01:32:35.117 --> 01:32:39.418
MATT and LAURA: (singing) Log! It's big, it's
heavy, it's wood!

01:32:39.418 --> 01:32:43.862
MATT: (singing) You're not meant to stand on this.
It's really obnoxious, yeah! We'll say right

01:32:43.862 --> 01:32:45.268
there. You're on it.

01:32:45.268 --> 01:32:46.655
LIAM: I'm on a log.

01:32:46.655 --> 01:32:56.721
LAURA: Wait. I can't get it quite that far, can I?
Hold on. Let me check one last thing before I

01:32:56.721 --> 01:32:58.066
definitely do that.

01:32:58.066 --> 01:33:02.095
MATT: You can get almost to it with a 60-foot
range.

01:33:02.095 --> 01:33:07.411
LAURA: Okay. I'll put it as close as I can to it.

01:33:07.411 --> 01:33:09.572
MATT: Right there is the closest you can get.

01:33:09.572 --> 01:33:12.126
LAURA: Yeah. That's my bonus action.

01:33:12.126 --> 01:33:13.117
MATT: Correct.

01:33:13.117 --> 01:33:19.946
LAURA: For my action, I'm going to wait until it's
close enough, and then I'm going to hit it.

01:33:19.946 --> 01:33:21.635
MATT: Okay, so you're holding?

01:33:21.635 --> 01:33:23.920
LAURA: I'm holding my actual action to attack it.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.305
MATT: Can you use an action to hit with it? I
think it's a bonus action.

01:33:26.305 --> 01:33:27.440
LAURA: No, it's a bonus action.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.301
MATT: Sorry.

01:33:28.301 --> 01:33:30.327
LAURA: That's dumb. That was dumb on my part.

01:33:30.327 --> 01:33:33.494
MARISHA: From my perspective, it looks like the
gator is super stoked about having this lollipop.

01:33:33.494 --> 01:33:44.455
MATT: This is his lucky day. This lollipop
apparates out of the swamp water and is now

01:33:44.455 --> 01:33:45.623
hovering there.

01:33:45.623 --> 01:33:49.754
LAURA: I'm going to hold Sacred Flame to cast on
him.

01:33:49.754 --> 01:33:55.686
MATT: You got it. Ending Jester's turn, that
brings us to Yasha. Full run. What's your speed?

01:33:55.686 --> 01:33:57.131
ASHLEY: 40 feet.

01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:00.648
MATT: 40 feet. You're right up next to Beau.

01:34:00.648 --> 01:34:04.418
TRAVIS: Fucking linebacker 40-yard dash.

01:34:04.418 --> 01:34:06.404
MARISHA: (heavy quick footsteps)

01:34:06.404 --> 01:34:10.204
ASHLEY: I can't walk in, right?

01:34:10.204 --> 01:34:15.255
MATT: No, that's double dash, because you guys all
stayed back while Jester ran in. You're all barely

01:34:15.255 --> 01:34:19.192
getting caught up to her at this point. Caleb,
you're up.

01:34:19.192 --> 01:34:25.773
LIAM: Oh, I am? Okay. I am going to stick a root
of licorice in my mouth like a hayseed like I'm

01:34:25.773 --> 01:34:34.235
Fjord and cast Haste on Nott. Read this because
your armor class is up, you have an extra action

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:42.146
per round, you have advantage on dexterity saves.
I will do my full movement forward. 30 feet.

01:34:42.146 --> 01:34:46.228
MATT: That's about as far as you get right there.
We'll say, comparatively. Just knock them around!

01:34:46.228 --> 01:34:47.963
TALIESIN: These happen to be made of metal.

01:34:47.963 --> 01:34:49.895
ASHLEY: Yeah, you get more out of it.

01:34:49.895 --> 01:34:52.809
MATT: It chips the paint better.

01:34:52.809 --> 01:34:57.432
Nott, you're up.

01:34:57.432 --> 01:34:58.946
SAM: Wow, I'm feeling so fast.

01:34:58.946 --> 01:35:00.139
LAURA: Ooh, you could double dash!

01:35:00.139 --> 01:35:03.614
SAM: I will dash. You know, to catch up to them, I
guess.

01:35:03.614 --> 01:35:09.093
MATT: With your regular movement speed, you'll get
up to where Caleb is. Sorry, where Molly is.

01:35:09.093 --> 01:35:11.179
SAM: I bonus action dash.

01:35:11.179 --> 01:35:18.872
MATT: Bonus action dash will get you up to where,
up to the edge and about, we'll say right there.

01:35:18.872 --> 01:35:24.394
SAM: Then I get two attacks. Two actions now,
right?

01:35:24.394 --> 01:35:26.264
LIAM: You have an extra action. Yeah.

01:35:26.264 --> 01:35:30.101
SAM: Whoa. That's still out of range of hand
crossbow.

01:35:30.101 --> 01:35:31.300
TALIESIN: Is it?

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:33.900
SAM: Well, no it's not. It's that I have to fire
at disadvantage.

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.193
MATT: Yeah. Up to you.

01:35:36.193 --> 01:35:40.020
SAM: All right. Sure. I'll do that, I guess.

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:42.954
LIAM: You can use the extra action to go closer as
well.

01:35:42.954 --> 01:35:44.321
SAM: That's true.

01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:46.046
LIAM: Or extra attack.

01:35:46.046 --> 01:35:53.718
SAM: Okay. I'll use one action to get closer
still. Okay.

01:35:53.718 --> 01:35:56.712
MATT: It's swampy. (marshy sloshing)

01:35:56.712 --> 01:36:00.963
SAM: I'll test the air and do a lob shot.

01:36:00.963 --> 01:36:03.482
MATT: Go for it, arcing it over. With
disadvantage.

01:36:03.482 --> 01:36:09.870
SAM: Okay. Ooh. Two plus something, so it's nine.

01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:15.878
MATT: No. It goes wide. Sticks into one of the
nearby swamp trees over here. That ends your turn.

01:36:15.878 --> 01:36:17.679
LAURA: That was really close, though!

01:36:17.679 --> 01:36:21.751
SAM: I'm sorry, Caleb! I failed you.

01:36:21.751 --> 01:36:29.370
LAURA: He's within range of my radiant blast now, so I
can attack him.

01:36:29.370 --> 01:36:33.292
MATT: You can, so do that as you release the
bolt.

01:36:33.292 --> 01:36:36.254
LAURA: Okay. The Sacred Flame is what I meant to
say. Dexterity of 15.

01:36:36.254 --> 01:36:39.914
MATT: That's a failure with a two. Roll damage.

01:36:39.914 --> 01:36:47.584
LAURA: Oh wait. Do I get more because I'm level
five now? "Spell damage increases when you

01:36:47.584 --> 01:36:51.882
"reach--" Oh 2d8, yes. Oh, good. Three whole
damage, woo.

01:36:51.882 --> 01:36:53.342
MATT: All right. Three.

01:36:53.342 --> 01:36:54.822
LIAM: I love this cleric.

01:36:54.822 --> 01:36:56.302
ASHLEY: That's still something.

01:36:56.302 --> 01:36:58.320
LIAM: That's fucking dumb.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.901
SAM: (mockingly) I can't do anything. I suck.

01:36:59.901 --> 01:37:03.006
LAURA: I can mend the shit out of some wheels,
though, bitches.

01:37:03.006 --> 01:37:04.458
MATT: It approaches--

01:37:04.458 --> 01:37:05.395
LAURA: No!

01:37:05.395 --> 01:37:10.156
MATT: --the bird creature. It doesn't have its
action to strike it, unfortunately, because it had

01:37:10.156 --> 01:37:13.249
to get the extra movement. Coming out of the way
here, you see--

01:37:13.249 --> 01:37:15.698
(gasping)

01:37:15.698 --> 01:37:21.482
MATT: Because at this point, you realize, the one
that was approaching it was approaching it from

01:37:21.482 --> 01:37:24.327
the opposite direction that Beau saw the other
thing move.

01:37:24.327 --> 01:37:26.497
LAURA: Yeah, I was wondering why it was coming
from the other direction.

01:37:26.497 --> 01:37:29.597
MATT: That's the one that Beau must have seen. It
begins to emerge from the brush underneath.

01:37:29.597 --> 01:37:37.008
There's this low growl. You hear the growling,
sucking sound as it approaches.

01:37:37.008 --> 01:37:38.494
LAURA: No!

01:37:38.494 --> 01:37:40.382
MATT: It's going to make a strike.

01:37:40.382 --> 01:37:41.999
ASHLEY: Oh no. Don't die.

01:37:41.999 --> 01:37:43.191
LAURA: Oh no! What if it's a trap?

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:53.302
MATT: Natural one. That's fucking lucky. As it
attempts to bite out towards it, the small bird

01:37:53.302 --> 01:38:02.791
creature scrambles backward and manages to beat
its jaw out of the way. It is going to attempt to

01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:08.211
swing around and swing its tail in its direction.
A two? Are you fucking serious?

01:38:08.211 --> 01:38:10.326
TALIESIN: Yeah! Sorry.

01:38:10.326 --> 01:38:16.991
LIAM: Screw you, Snitch.

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:18.335
TRAVIS: The dice can hear you.

01:38:18.335 --> 01:38:20.359
MATT: Okay. Apparently. So yeah.

01:38:20.359 --> 01:38:25.018
TRAVIS: He's so pissed.

01:38:25.018 --> 01:38:27.737
MATT: Although, technically, the creature is
restrained, so it does have advantage on its

01:38:27.737 --> 01:38:34.437
attacks. Yeah, attack rolls against it have
advantage, because it's restrained. So the first

01:38:34.437 --> 01:38:42.601
attack missed, the bite. The tail does hit. The
jaws, it missed with a one and a two on the first

01:38:42.601 --> 01:38:46.242
strike. The second one it swings with its tail--
Hey.

01:38:46.242 --> 01:38:47.407
TRAVIS: I love it.

01:38:47.407 --> 01:38:53.694
MATT: I'm going by the rules. It's restrained. The
second one, the tail, does hit. Crack! This is

01:38:53.694 --> 01:39:04.436
going to be 19 points of bludgeoning damage. As
the tail cracks across the scrambling bird, you

01:39:04.436 --> 01:39:13.682
watch as it goes limp and is currently
unconscious, its tiny form now stuck in the bog

01:39:13.682 --> 01:39:14.795
and unmoving.

01:39:14.795 --> 01:39:16.313
LAURA: We should have got to it sooner!

01:39:16.313 --> 01:39:17.814
MARISHA: This is so prehistoric!

01:39:17.814 --> 01:39:21.611
TRAVIS: Now we're in this for a dying bird?

01:39:21.611 --> 01:39:23.058
MATT: Now it's Fjord's turn.

01:39:23.058 --> 01:39:27.103
TRAVIS: Are we staying in this?

01:39:27.103 --> 01:39:28.828
LAURA: Hey, man. I'm up here. I don't know.

01:39:28.828 --> 01:39:35.699
TRAVIS: All right. Fine. I'll use my speed to
approach 15 feet. Half of 30.

01:39:35.699 --> 01:39:39.842
MATT: Your speed will get you about there. You and
Caleb are about the same space.

01:39:39.842 --> 01:39:46.975
TRAVIS: I'll use Eldritch Blast at 120 feet for
the gator. The farthest north.

01:39:46.975 --> 01:39:48.657
MATT: Roll the attacks.

01:39:48.657 --> 01:39:54.885
TRAVIS: Two beams. That's a fat one plus four.
That's five points of damage.

01:39:54.885 --> 01:39:56.450
MATT: Five points.

01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:59.682
TRAVIS: And the second beam 12 points of damage.

01:39:59.682 --> 01:40:01.951
MATT: Did you roll for the attacks on each of
those?

01:40:01.951 --> 01:40:07.763
TRAVIS: I did not. I have never played this game
before, apparently. Thank you guys for your

01:40:07.763 --> 01:40:10.872
patience. That is a nine.

01:40:10.872 --> 01:40:12.331
MATT: Nine misses.

01:40:12.331 --> 01:40:14.363
TRAVIS: And that's a 12.

01:40:14.363 --> 01:40:22.353
MATT: 12 misses. Both go wide off into space. No
damage to that croc. However, as it slams into the

01:40:22.353 --> 01:40:29.023
wood nearby and the ground, it turns in your
direction, noticing now the arriving brigade.

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:34.251
TRAVIS: I'll use my bonus action to cast--

01:40:34.251 --> 01:40:35.642
MARISHA: We're the brigade.

01:40:35.642 --> 01:40:37.731
TRAVIS: Nope, that's it. That's my turn.

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:40.370
MATT: Top of the round now. Molly and Beau.

01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:45.955
MARISHA: Are we doing this? Birds die this way all
the time.

01:40:45.955 --> 01:40:47.468
LAURA: It's not a bird!

01:40:47.468 --> 01:40:49.008
MARISHA: What? It's feathery!

01:40:49.008 --> 01:40:51.076
LAURA: No, it looked like a person, you guys!

01:40:51.076 --> 01:40:57.477
TRAVIS: But look. I mean, two big-ass, right at
the dinner table, we're real far away. Going to

01:40:57.477 --> 01:40:59.851
take a hot minute for us to get there. The bell's
been rung.

01:40:59.851 --> 01:41:01.434
MARISHA: What if it's Febron?

01:41:01.434 --> 01:41:05.841
TALIESIN: I'm at least going to get up to-- What's
a basic movement?

01:41:05.841 --> 01:41:10.394
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, at
movement, because the space is not right here, so

01:41:10.394 --> 01:41:12.227
I'm going to get you on the edge of the map for
your movement.

01:41:12.227 --> 01:41:14.566
TALIESIN: Am I within 60 feet of either of these?

01:41:14.566 --> 01:41:15.597
MATT: Sure, you are.

01:41:15.597 --> 01:41:19.746
TALIESIN: Are we doing this? Well, we're doing
this. I'm going to try and cast Enthrall on the

01:41:19.746 --> 01:41:23.943
closest gator.

01:41:23.943 --> 01:41:29.459
MATT: The closest gator? Okay then. Let me pull it
up here. That's a--

01:41:29.459 --> 01:41:33.199
TALIESIN: Wisdom save?

01:41:33.199 --> 01:41:37.436
MATT: Enthrall. That's probably a bard spell.

01:41:37.436 --> 01:41:43.388
Enthrall. All right. You weave a
distracting string of words (mumbles).

01:41:43.388 --> 01:41:45.714
TRAVIS: Enthrall.

01:41:45.714 --> 01:41:51.249
MATT: It has advantage on the save because you
guys have attacked it.

01:41:51.249 --> 01:41:55.527
TALIESIN: I haven't attacked that one yet. Oh,
you're right. Yes, of course.

01:41:55.527 --> 01:41:59.281
TRAVIS: What if it's not successful attacks?

01:41:59.281 --> 01:42:05.846
MATT: That's a two plus zero. That is an eight
plus zero.

01:42:05.846 --> 01:42:07.218
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

01:42:07.218 --> 01:42:10.599
MATT: I don't think it makes it, actually. You're
really lucky.

01:42:10.599 --> 01:42:11.782
TALIESIN: Is eight my save on wisdom?

01:42:11.782 --> 01:42:16.432
MATT: What's your spell DC? It should say. Is it
charisma-based?

01:42:16.432 --> 01:42:18.771
TALIESIN: It says wisdom, but I don't know.

01:42:18.771 --> 01:42:21.588
MATT: It's a wisdom save, but is the ability
your racial ability?

01:42:21.588 --> 01:42:23.499
TALIESIN: No, yeah it's a racial ability.

01:42:23.499 --> 01:42:27.228
MATT: Yeah, then it's charisma-based, because all
of them are, so it's DC ten. It still succeeds,

01:42:27.228 --> 01:42:33.622
actually. It rolled really poorly. So the creature
has disadvantage to perceive any creatures other

01:42:33.622 --> 01:42:35.313
than you until the spell ends.

01:42:35.313 --> 01:42:37.660
SAM: It has disadvantage to perceive?

01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:42.092
TALIESIN: Yep. It ain't going to eat. It means
it's going to pay attention to me and only me.

01:42:42.092 --> 01:42:45.209
LAURA: That's wonderful. Oh no.

01:42:45.209 --> 01:42:49.038
TALIESIN: I know. I'm sitting. I'm spinning my
sword and talking in--

01:42:49.038 --> 01:42:50.675
LAURA: In gator.

01:42:50.675 --> 01:42:53.821
TALIESIN: (Infernal voice)

01:42:53.821 --> 01:42:58.207
MATT: It seems to have paid attention. I mean, it
senses all of your presence, but it's focused on

01:42:58.207 --> 01:43:02.142
you. If any of you are trying to get around
stealthily, it's going to have a hard time

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:04.589
noticing you. That ends your turn?

01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:05.461
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:43:05.461 --> 01:43:06.698
MATT: All righty. Beau?

01:43:06.698 --> 01:43:10.033
MARISHA: Am I able to have enough movement to get
on this stumpy stump?

01:43:10.033 --> 01:43:16.256
MATT: You can get up to here, I'd say, if you move
at the same pace. That's your movement. You have

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:18.729
your action and your bonus still.

01:43:18.729 --> 01:43:29.328
MARISHA: I don't think I'm-- I'm not within 60
feet of any of them, am I? No, I guess I am to

01:43:29.328 --> 01:43:36.243
throw a thing. Can I use my bonus to move a little
bit further onto the top of this tree?

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:39.131
MATT: If you want to spend a ki point to do your
step of the wind.

01:43:39.131 --> 01:43:44.636
MARISHA: My step of the wind? I can't get within
range of them with my step of the wind though, right?

01:43:44.636 --> 01:43:47.547
MATT: Almost.

01:43:47.547 --> 01:43:51.741
MARISHA: Fuck. God damn it.

01:43:51.741 --> 01:43:56.594
MATT: Although if you aren't moving towards that
tree and you move there instead--

01:43:56.594 --> 01:43:58.344
MARISHA: If I move straight?

01:43:58.344 --> 01:44:02.305
MATT: No, that's still the same. Yeah, just out of
range.

01:44:02.305 --> 01:44:04.052
LIAM: Get them ninja stars out.

01:44:04.052 --> 01:44:10.972
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to ninja star for my main
attack and if I can-- I don't know if I can-- I

01:44:10.972 --> 01:44:12.956
can't move on my bonus, can I?

01:44:12.956 --> 01:44:14.375
MATT: You can if you spend a ki point.

01:44:14.375 --> 01:44:18.107
MARISHA: Only if I move a ki point. Right. Nah,
fuck it. Ninja star.

01:44:18.107 --> 01:44:20.825
MATT: All right. Go for it. You get two at the
creature.

01:44:20.825 --> 01:44:24.101
MARISHA: Okay. That's a 20 for the first one.

01:44:24.101 --> 01:44:25.297
MATT: 20 hits.

01:44:25.297 --> 01:44:27.474
MARISHA: Ooh, and a natural 19 for the second one.

01:44:27.474 --> 01:44:29.336
MATT: Both hit. Roll damage on each.

01:44:29.336 --> 01:44:30.766
MARISHA: These are 1d4s, right?

01:44:30.766 --> 01:44:34.684
LIAM: They're darts. I think they're homebrewed
darts.

01:44:34.684 --> 01:44:41.247
MARISHA: Yeah, I think it's 1d4. For the first
one, that's seven. For the second one, that's

01:44:41.247 --> 01:44:46.187
five. Gambit style!

01:44:46.187 --> 01:44:47.751
TRAVIS: Total armpit throw.

01:44:47.751 --> 01:44:52.711
MATT: As you throw them both, they (whoosh whoosh)
and it's like (low growl) and it opens its jaws.

01:44:52.711 --> 01:44:59.769
MARISHA: I point at Percy and I go, "He did it!"
Oh, I called him Percy! I think that's the first

01:44:59.769 --> 01:45:01.014
time I've done that!

01:45:01.014 --> 01:45:02.542
LIAM: I think that's the first time any of us have
ever done that.

01:45:02.542 --> 01:45:04.158
MARISHA: I point at Molly. He did it.

01:45:04.158 --> 01:45:05.581
LIAM: (as Grog) He did it!

01:45:05.581 --> 01:45:09.925
MARISHA: Aw! I miss Percy.

01:45:09.925 --> 01:45:14.213
LIAM: (sings) Light the corner of my mind.

01:45:14.281 --> 01:45:17.010
MATT: That end your guys' turns. Jester, you're
up.

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:21.629
LAURA: Okay. Oh, god! Can I climb up on this tree
right in front of me?

01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:23.127
MATT: Right here?

01:45:23.127 --> 01:45:24.355
LAURA: For my move, yeah.

01:45:24.355 --> 01:45:26.445
MATT: Sure. Make an athletics check.

01:45:26.445 --> 01:45:28.170
TALIESIN: Oh boy. Don't fall.

01:45:28.170 --> 01:45:35.467
LAURA: I was so afraid it was going to be a one.
16.

01:45:35.467 --> 01:45:38.357
MATT: Sure, let me put you up there in the tree.

01:45:38.357 --> 01:45:44.266
LAURA: Okay, good! I'm going to cast
Blindness/Deafness at level three on both of the--

01:45:44.266 --> 01:45:45.973
MATT: At level three, a different target.

01:45:45.973 --> 01:45:47.313
MARISHA: That's cool!

01:45:47.313 --> 01:45:51.437
MATT: That's pretty great. What's the wisdom save
on that?

01:45:51.437 --> 01:45:52.642
SAM: Blind or deaf?

01:45:52.642 --> 01:45:53.745
LAURA: It's both.

01:45:53.745 --> 01:45:54.832
LIAM: What's that spell do?

01:45:54.832 --> 01:45:56.106
LAURA: Blindness/Deafness.

01:45:56.106 --> 01:45:57.156
MATT: Wisdom save?

01:45:57.156 --> 01:45:58.466
LAURA: It's a con save.

01:45:58.466 --> 01:46:00.367
MATT: Con save. All right.

01:46:00.367 --> 01:46:02.320
LAURA: Either blinded or deafened.

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.810
MATT: A 19 on that one.

01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:05.041
LAURA: Okay, shit.

01:46:05.041 --> 01:46:08.382
MATT: He succeeds. That's a 14 on the other.

01:46:08.382 --> 01:46:14.435
That one, however, is blinded.

01:46:14.435 --> 01:46:16.013
LAURA: Yeah, he's blind.

01:46:16.013 --> 01:46:20.912
MATT: You watch as, all of a sudden, the eyes
darken and it begins to (snarls), flailing about,

01:46:20.912 --> 01:46:23.255
unable to actually make a bead on where any of you
are at the moment.

01:46:23.255 --> 01:46:25.123
LAURA: He's got a disadvantage on his attack
rolls? Is that what it is?

01:46:25.123 --> 01:46:26.763
MATT: Yep, and advantage on attack rolls against
it.

01:46:26.763 --> 01:46:31.728
LAURA: That's good. Okay. Then I'm going to use
my spiritual weapon to come up behind the other

01:46:31.728 --> 01:46:33.697
gator and smack him on the back!

01:46:33.697 --> 01:46:35.051
MATT: Boop! Go for it.

01:46:35.051 --> 01:46:41.251
LAURA: Okay. Someday, I'm going to know what I'm
doing.

01:46:41.251 --> 01:46:42.658
MATT: That's not concentration, correct?

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:44.124
LAURA: No. Spiritual Weapon is just up.

01:46:44.124 --> 01:46:45.227
MATT: Just lasts for a minute?

01:46:45.227 --> 01:46:46.220
LAURA: Oh, Blindness/Deafness?

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.155
MATT: Yes.

01:46:47.155 --> 01:46:52.530
LAURA: Blindness/Deafness is not concentration.
Yeah, it's just a minute.

01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:54.031
TALIESIN: Just a minute of pain.

01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:57.501
MATT: At the end of each of its turns, it can make
a constitution saving throw. Good to know.

01:46:57.501 --> 01:47:03.396
LAURA: Plus seven to hit. That's 23.

01:47:03.396 --> 01:47:04.931
MATT: That hits! Roll damage.

01:47:04.931 --> 01:47:09.585
LAURA: Okie-dokie. That is eight damage.

01:47:09.585 --> 01:47:27.479
MATT: Nice. Your lollipop slams into the back of
that distant alligator, but it's still right there

01:47:27.479 --> 01:47:32.763
with the unconscious creature in front of it,
starting to figure out where to keep its focus. It

01:47:32.763 --> 01:47:37.484
seems hungry, but it's also being assaulted. That
ends Jester's turn. Yasha, you're up.

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:41.540
ASHLEY: Okay. How close can I get to the--

01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:43.401
MATT: Movement will get you up to there.

01:47:43.401 --> 01:47:59.211
ASHLEY: Oh shit. Okay. Well, I would like to rage.
Get that fired up.

01:47:59.211 --> 01:48:04.894
MATT: Okay. Your vision goes faintly dark red as
you begin to focus your frustration towards these

01:48:04.894 --> 01:48:06.443
creatures. What do you do?

01:48:06.443 --> 01:48:09.774
ASHLEY: I mean, I can't move anymore, so--

01:48:09.774 --> 01:48:11.972
MATT: You can use your action to move, if you want
to.

01:48:11.972 --> 01:48:13.433
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. Yes.

01:48:13.433 --> 01:48:18.032
MATT: At least it'll get you into the fray. That's
as close as you can get there.

01:48:18.032 --> 01:48:21.221
ASHLEY: All right. That's my turn.

01:48:21.221 --> 01:48:23.443
MATT: That ends your turn. Caleb, you're up.

01:48:23.443 --> 01:48:28.132
LIAM: I think that I see one of the giant gators
is getting close to Nott and also Yasha, so I'm

01:48:28.132 --> 01:48:35.172
going to tug really hard on the Glove of Blasting
and revolve around my wrist three times and use

01:48:35.172 --> 01:48:36.541
Scorching Ray.

01:48:36.541 --> 01:48:40.925
MATT: Scorching Ray. Go for it. Roll three attacks
on it, right?

01:48:40.925 --> 01:48:42.940
LIAM: Edubation. Say again?

01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.445
MATT: How many rays is it? Three rays?

01:48:44.445 --> 01:48:46.503
LIAM: Three attacks, advantage against the target,
correct?

01:48:46.503 --> 01:48:47.515
MATT: Correct.

01:48:47.515 --> 01:48:52.876
LIAM: First one is a 17.

01:48:52.876 --> 01:48:54.011
MATT: That hits.

01:48:54.011 --> 01:48:57.431
LIAM: Okay. Second one is a natural 20.

01:48:57.431 --> 01:48:58.744
MATT: Nice.

01:48:58.744 --> 01:49:02.667
LIAM: Third one is a 17. So they all hit.

01:49:02.667 --> 01:49:05.616
MATT: They all hit. Second set of rolls is
doubled.

01:49:05.616 --> 01:49:18.684
LIAM: Ja. Here we go. Dang it! Total of 21 fire
damage.

01:49:18.684 --> 01:49:22.778
MATT: Nice! Not bad at all. Looking up at the
distance, you tug on the glove and release as

01:49:22.778 --> 01:49:29.362
these three bolts arc out and slam into the rather
broad side of this reptilian creature, this large

01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:30.927
crocodile that's now--

01:49:30.927 --> 01:49:32.089
LAURA: Was that the one that is--

01:49:32.089 --> 01:49:32.993
MATT: Blinded.

01:49:32.993 --> 01:49:33.909
LAURA: Okay.

01:49:33.909 --> 01:49:36.468
LIAM: Ja. Then I will keep wading through the
shit, try to get a little bit closer.

01:49:36.468 --> 01:49:41.183
MATT: Okay. With that, you get to about there.

01:49:41.183 --> 01:49:45.347
LIAM: And say, "Hey! Fjord, isn't this fun?" And
that's it.

01:49:45.347 --> 01:49:47.946
MATT: Ending Caleb's turn. Nott, you're up.

01:49:47.946 --> 01:49:56.365
SAM: Because that gator is blind, does that mean
it counts as sneak attack?

01:49:56.365 --> 01:49:57.514
MATT: Yep.

01:49:57.514 --> 01:49:59.512
SAM: Okay. Then I will bolt, bolt, bolt.

01:49:59.512 --> 01:50:00.657
MATT: Go for it.

01:50:00.657 --> 01:50:06.295
SAM: Three attacks. They all hit. 19, 15, 13, plus
things

01:50:06.295 --> 01:50:09.607
LIAM: But what if you get a natural 20? Roll
again, in case you get 20's.

01:50:09.607 --> 01:50:13.136
SAM: I'll roll again. Sure.

01:50:13.136 --> 01:50:14.314
LAURA: Ooh, he did!

01:50:14.314 --> 01:50:15.651
LIAM: We got a natural 20.

01:50:15.651 --> 01:50:16.732
SAM: One of them is a natural 20.

01:50:16.732 --> 01:50:19.323
MATT: You got to roll them in order, though,
because you don't know if the one that got sneak

01:50:19.323 --> 01:50:20.954
attack is. You have to declare that when it
happens.

01:50:20.954 --> 01:50:22.170
SAM: They all get sneak attack.

01:50:22.170 --> 01:50:23.334
MATT: Well, you only get sneak attack once per
round.

01:50:23.334 --> 01:50:25.862
SAM: Oh, okay. Got it. Well, it was the second
one.

01:50:25.862 --> 01:50:27.373
MATT: Second one got crit.

01:50:27.373 --> 01:50:28.445
SAM: Yes.

01:50:28.445 --> 01:50:29.822
MATT: Right. So the first one would've been sneak
attack.

01:50:29.822 --> 01:50:30.865
SAM: Okay.

01:50:30.865 --> 01:50:32.190
MATT: First strike--

01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:42.411
SAM: --is 17 plus four, 21. Plus I'll use Fury of
the Small, making it 26.

01:50:42.411 --> 01:50:45.478
MARISHA: How often do you get to add that?

01:50:45.478 --> 01:50:52.340
SAM: Just once a day. Then second does not get
sneak attack? Even though it's at disadvantage.

01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:56.544
MATT: Sneak attack, you only get once per turn.
Not per round, per turn. So you can still get it

01:50:56.544 --> 01:50:58.058
on a reaction.

01:50:58.058 --> 01:51:02.437
SAM: Six, but that's doubled?

01:51:02.437 --> 01:51:04.351
MATT: Whatever you rolled on the dice, doubled.

01:51:04.351 --> 01:51:06.172
SAM: Four, so eight. Eight for that one.

01:51:06.172 --> 01:51:07.864
MATT: Eight points of damage.

01:51:07.864 --> 01:51:10.911
SAM: Then one more. That's ten.

01:51:10.911 --> 01:51:21.657
MATT: Ten points of damage. This poor gator turned
around, went blind, got shot multiple times,

01:51:21.657 --> 01:51:23.941
blasted with fiery beams.

01:51:23.941 --> 01:51:26.583
SAM: It still can't stop thinking about Mollymauk,
though.

01:51:26.583 --> 01:51:31.941
MATT: No, it's just so focused on him. That ends
your turn?

01:51:31.941 --> 01:51:40.357
SAM: I'm going to move behind that rock over
there. (yelping) That's it.

01:51:40.357 --> 01:51:51.067
MATT: That ends your turn. It is now the crocs'
turns. (counts movement) It actually climbs up the

01:51:51.067 --> 01:51:58.643
rock after you, (stomping) and then goes and takes
a swipe down at you.

01:51:58.643 --> 01:52:00.412
LIAM: +2 on your AC.

01:52:00.412 --> 01:52:01.710
SAM: Sure.

01:52:01.710 --> 01:52:04.687
MATT: That is 23 to hit.

01:52:04.687 --> 01:52:06.978
SAM: Damn it. Sure.

01:52:06.978 --> 01:52:10.395
MATT: With that, 3d10 plus five.

01:52:10.395 --> 01:52:13.845
TRAVIS: 3d10 plus five?

01:52:13.845 --> 01:52:15.491
MATT: Yeah. It's a large set of jaws.

01:52:15.491 --> 01:52:20.492
SAM: I'm going to be using Uncanny Dodge for the
first time.

01:52:20.492 --> 01:52:28.506
MATT: 21 points of piercing damage, halved. You
take ten points of piercing damage, but you are

01:52:28.506 --> 01:52:35.873
grappled as the giant jaws slam into you and hold
you in place. You're unable to escape at that point.

01:52:35.873 --> 01:52:38.756
SAM: (yelping) We're both reptiles, man! Come on!
Be cool!

01:52:38.756 --> 01:52:39.993
LAURA: Are goblins reptiles?

01:52:39.993 --> 01:52:41.900
SAM: I don't know. Maybe he's dumb.

01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:48.614
MARISHA: See, now I'm getting Little Mermaid
vibes, though, from the gator. (singing) Up where

01:52:48.614 --> 01:52:55.109
they walk, up where they run, up where they stay
all day in the sun.

01:52:55.109 --> 01:53:00.242
MATT: It's going to take a swing with its tail
towards you as it's flailing about, hearing noise

01:53:00.242 --> 01:53:09.130
in that direction. It has disadvantage against
you. That's 22 and 12. That misses in the first

01:53:09.130 --> 01:53:14.423
attack as its tail goes wide. It turns around and
snaps its jaws towards the tree and scrapes off

01:53:14.423 --> 01:53:19.124
the side of the tree and swings in your direction,
as it attempts to bite towards you. That's going

01:53:19.124 --> 01:53:20.840
to be a 14. What's your armor class?

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:21.878
ASHLEY: Just hits.

01:53:21.878 --> 01:53:30.872
MATT: 14's your armor class? That's right. You
have the jaws slam onto you. You suffer 18 points

01:53:30.872 --> 01:53:34.869
of piercing damage, but because you're raging,
that's reduced to nine. You get nine points of

01:53:34.869 --> 01:53:38.622
piercing damage, but you are grappled and
restrained currently, as you are now trapped in

01:53:38.622 --> 01:53:45.526
its jaws. You watch as Nott's hands are dangling
out of its toothy jaws, it's swinging her in the

01:53:45.526 --> 01:53:50.242
air. Yasha is lifted up off her feet and is
currently trying to pry the jaws open off of her

01:53:50.242 --> 01:54:03.880
body, but is unable to do so. Death saving throw
for the creature. That's a failure. Fjord, you're up.

01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:12.510
TRAVIS: Nott's all caught up. I say: Crap. Fire.
And two more bursts of Eldritch Blast to the gator

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:13.512
holding Nott.

01:54:13.512 --> 01:54:14.697
MATT: Holding Nott? Go for it.

01:54:14.697 --> 01:54:20.277
TRAVIS: That'll hit. That's 23.

01:54:20.277 --> 01:54:21.375
MATT: That'll do.

01:54:21.375 --> 01:54:24.090
TRAVIS: And the second one. That'll hit, too.
That's a natural 17.

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:25.505
MATT: You got it.

01:54:25.505 --> 01:54:33.387
TRAVIS: Okay, great. 12 points of damage on the
first one, and six points of damage on the second

01:54:33.387 --> 01:54:35.107
one, so 18 total.

01:54:35.107 --> 01:54:44.071
MATT: Nice. As you release the two bolts, they manage
to peek around the tree, see it grasping Nott in

01:54:44.071 --> 01:54:47.356
its jaws and swinging her back and forth. One hits
the bottom of the jaw, and the other hits its

01:54:47.356 --> 01:54:52.720
side. You see this little splatter of dark crimson
alligator blood from the two impacts, but it's

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.456
still holding taut to this tiny little morsel it
has in its jaws.

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:59.178
TRAVIS: I'll use my pathetic speed to try and match
Caleb.

01:54:59.178 --> 01:55:02.173
MATT: All right. Want to move Caleb up for me,
Beau? Somebody?

01:55:02.173 --> 01:55:03.632
MARISHA: Caleb, or Fjord?

01:55:03.632 --> 01:55:04.846
MATT: I'm sorry. Meant to say Fjord to Caleb.

01:55:04.846 --> 01:55:10.325
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is so much fun. I'm glad we are
helping this random-ass penguin.

01:55:10.325 --> 01:55:15.239
MATT: At least you guys have range. That brings us to the
top again. Molly and Beau.

01:55:15.239 --> 01:55:17.808
TALIESIN: You want to go first?

01:55:17.808 --> 01:55:19.770
MARISHA: Sure.

01:55:19.770 --> 01:55:20.782
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:55:20.782 --> 01:55:24.250
MARISHA: Can I get to this guy who's got Nott?

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:25.332
MATT: Yeah.

01:55:25.332 --> 01:55:31.903
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to parkour off.

01:55:31.903 --> 01:55:40.514
MATT: That is a 16 on the saving throw for the
blind crocodile, so it does resist the blindness.

01:55:40.514 --> 01:55:47.610
Its vision comes back. However, it fucked it up for a
round. Beau.

01:55:47.666 --> 01:55:52.894
MARISHA: I'm going to do a parkour off of the rock
and come down and try and get it right in its

01:55:52.894 --> 01:56:01.091
mouth to try and get it to spit out Nott. So the
first attack. That's good. That's a 21.

01:56:01.091 --> 01:56:02.584
MATT: 21 hits.

01:56:02.584 --> 01:56:05.493
MARISHA: That's better. That's 22.

01:56:05.493 --> 01:56:08.991
MATT: That hits. With two strikes with the staff.

01:56:08.991 --> 01:56:16.567
MARISHA: Spit it out! Both of those are the same,
which is seven.

01:56:16.567 --> 01:56:25.254
MATT: Seven damage each? So 14? Cool. It's 14
points of damage with the two strikes?

01:56:25.254 --> 01:56:26.402
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:56:26.402 --> 01:56:32.012
MATT: Slamming into the side of its heavy, thick,
scaled hide. It's hurting, but it's definitely a

01:56:32.012 --> 01:56:33.203
resistant beast.

01:56:33.203 --> 01:56:38.049
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point now to do
two more, flurry of blows.

01:56:38.049 --> 01:56:41.470
MATT: You pull your staff behind and then you go
to a punch and a dropkick.

01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:43.271
MARISHA: That's an 18, and they just keep getting
better.

01:56:43.271 --> 01:56:44.413
MATT: Way to go. That hits.

01:56:44.413 --> 01:56:48.659
MARISHA: And that one's not great. That's worse.
That's a 12.

01:56:48.659 --> 01:56:54.214
MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately, but you do get
one punch off. After slamming it twice, you go for

01:56:54.214 --> 01:56:55.809
the softer part and whack!

01:56:55.809 --> 01:57:02.362
MARISHA: You know what? I rolled the wrong damage
die for those first two, but that's my fault. Six

01:57:02.362 --> 01:57:05.235
damage. I rolled d6s instead of d8s.

01:57:05.235 --> 01:57:07.358
MATT: Oh, gotcha, but there you go.

01:57:07.358 --> 01:57:09.691
MARISHA: That gator got lucky.

01:57:09.691 --> 01:57:13.586
LAURA: Why don't you take off the damage you did
and reroll as eights?

01:57:13.586 --> 01:57:15.738
TRAVIS: Because that's how the cookie crumbles.

01:57:15.738 --> 01:57:20.301
MATT: Okay. Moving on. That's fine. It's okay.
It's still a fair amount of damage. Molly, what

01:57:20.301 --> 01:57:21.609
are you doing?

01:57:21.609 --> 01:57:26.472
TALIESIN: With my running speed, how close can I
get and still have an action?

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:27.819
MATT: That's it.

01:57:27.819 --> 01:57:29.374
TALIESIN: That's as far as I can get without an
action?

01:57:29.374 --> 01:57:35.206
MATT: Unfortunately, you guys are running through
a swamp behind who engaged it, so it's an

01:57:35.206 --> 01:57:36.948
unfortunate circumstance.

01:57:36.948 --> 01:57:40.318
TALIESIN: At the very least, then, I'm going to--

01:57:40.318 --> 01:57:42.119
MATT: Fortune favors the bold in this case.

01:57:42.119 --> 01:57:47.549
TALIESIN: Yep. Since I still have some distance,
I'm going to try some Vicious Mockery to see if

01:57:47.549 --> 01:57:50.807
that does anything. The one--

01:57:50.807 --> 01:57:53.522
TRAVIS: Please Schwarzenegger it with, "You're
luggage."

01:57:53.522 --> 01:58:00.658
TALIESIN: I'm curious what that's going to sound
like. I'll hit the Vicious Mockery on the one that

01:58:00.658 --> 01:58:02.354
currently has Nott, just because--

01:58:02.354 --> 01:58:04.725
MATT: Sure. That is a natural 19.

01:58:04.725 --> 01:58:08.117
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. (Infernal coughing)

01:58:08.117 --> 01:58:12.091
MATT: A swamp bug goes into your throat as you're
trying speak it, and you have to cough it out for

01:58:12.091 --> 01:58:15.669
a second. That finishes Molly's run. Jester,
you're up.

01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:29.605
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity as my
action, and I'm going to pop my little person down

01:58:29.605 --> 01:58:41.828
right behind the other side of the gator that
Yasha's fighting, yes. Then for my bonus action,

01:58:41.828 --> 01:58:47.611
I'm going to cast Healing Word on the little bird
creature.

01:58:47.611 --> 01:58:52.239
MATT: Okay. Roll to heal on that one. It's within
range.

01:58:52.239 --> 01:58:53.626
LAURA: That's six.

01:58:53.626 --> 01:58:59.056
MATT: Six points of healing. You watch as
suddenly, its yellow eye flickers and looks around

01:58:59.056 --> 01:59:02.779
for a second and it begins to push against the
slickness.

01:59:02.779 --> 01:59:06.678
LAURA: My invoked Jester turns around and thumbs
ups to it.

01:59:06.678 --> 01:59:10.667
MATT: It looks at it. (bird croaking) It begins to
try and pull its way back out of the bog. It's

01:59:10.667 --> 01:59:15.977
getting stuck and sliding in, but it's trying to
pull itself backward. That's your turn, Jester.

01:59:15.977 --> 01:59:17.455
LAURA: That's all I can do.

01:59:17.455 --> 01:59:18.592
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

01:59:18.592 --> 01:59:21.577
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm in the jaws.

01:59:21.577 --> 01:59:24.676
MATT: In its jaws. So you are restrained. You can
still attack it, but you're at disadvantage on all

01:59:24.676 --> 01:59:25.835
your attacks.

01:59:25.835 --> 01:59:36.160
ASHLEY: Okay. I will try to attack. Divine fury,
and if I do reckless, does that mean--

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.090
MATT: If you reckless, it'll become regular
attacks.

01:59:38.090 --> 01:59:40.023
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do that.

01:59:40.023 --> 01:59:45.600
MATT: All right. Make your two strikes. First one
with divine fury as you swing down towards the top

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:47.338
of its jaws with your blade.

01:59:47.338 --> 01:59:49.422
ASHLEY: That's a natural one.

01:59:49.422 --> 01:59:57.787
MATT: As you go to swing, the jaws tense against
you and (groans) it hurts and all your muscles tense

01:59:57.787 --> 01:59:59.961
from the pain, but you stay focused going for your
second strike.

02:00:00.014 --> 02:00:07.714
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry, hold on. Oh wait, no, I'm
doing this one. 17.

02:00:07.714 --> 02:00:11.150
MATT: 17 does hit, roll damage. This still gets
divine fury though, because it's the first strike

02:00:11.150 --> 02:00:12.164
that you hit with.

02:00:12.164 --> 02:00:13.658
ASHLEY: It's the first strike, okay.

02:00:13.658 --> 02:00:22.152
SAM: Man, this is exciting.

02:00:22.152 --> 02:00:24.274
ASHLEY: Okay, so eight--

02:00:24.274 --> 02:00:26.744
SAM: That's not enough.

02:00:26.744 --> 02:00:32.208
TALIESIN: (Infernal voice) Crocodile Dundee.

02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:33.745
ASHLEY: 18.

02:00:33.745 --> 02:00:35.908
MATT: 18 points of damage. How do you want to do
this?

02:00:35.908 --> 02:00:38.426
(cheering)

02:00:38.426 --> 02:00:42.684
MATT: You guys have been plugging everything into
this one croc since the beginning of the battle.

02:00:42.684 --> 02:00:48.587
ASHLEY: Am I actually able to-- If I have my hand
on his jaws, just pull them apart.

02:00:48.587 --> 02:00:50.738
MATT: Yeah, you can because you're inside of it.

02:00:50.738 --> 02:00:52.639
ASHLEY: Open the jaw, just stand.

02:00:52.639 --> 02:00:57.585
MATT: You pull yourself, you pull the jaws open
and step out of it, getting your feet on the

02:00:57.585 --> 02:01:04.574
ground as you yank apart. You put your leg up into
it and (snapping). You feel the jaw pop. It falls

02:01:04.574 --> 02:01:11.436
back for a moment, its jaw now limp and its tongue
lolling out to one side. You have your blade and

02:01:11.436 --> 02:01:12.857
you do the finishing blow.

02:01:12.857 --> 02:01:14.405
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:01:14.405 --> 02:01:16.507
MATT: Oh, I mean describe to me the finishing
blow.

02:01:16.507 --> 02:01:17.627
ASHLEY: Oh, finishing blow.

02:01:17.627 --> 02:01:19.630
MATT: Breaking its jaw isn't going to kill it. So
how do you kill it?

02:01:19.630 --> 02:01:27.238
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll try to chop off the head as
much as I can.

02:01:27.238 --> 02:01:32.439
MATT: Okay. After breaking the jaw you step out,
pull the blade from behind you and with a wide swipe,

02:01:32.439 --> 02:01:39.690
like an anti-cavalry blow, you cut through the
side of its throat and neck. It doesn't get all

02:01:39.690 --> 02:01:43.432
the way through, but it cuts enough through the
spine where it falls to the ground. This long,

02:01:43.432 --> 02:01:51.344
heavy, limp piece of luggage. We'll leave that
there for its size, though. You going to stay

02:01:51.344 --> 02:01:54.764
where you are? You want to move? Because you still
have movement, you've been released from its jaws.

02:01:54.764 --> 02:02:04.075
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I move towards the back of the
other one? In front of Jester; in between the croc

02:02:04.075 --> 02:02:05.517
and Jester.

02:02:05.517 --> 02:02:08.822
MATT: That's as far as you can get. Well, you can
get there, actually.

02:02:08.822 --> 02:02:10.020
ASHLEY: Perfect. Yeah, perfect.

02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:12.874
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. Yasha's finished.
Caleb, you're up.

02:02:12.874 --> 02:02:18.783
LIAM: Ja, it seems like I'm-- can I get within
30 feet of it? No, correct? I would think probably not.

02:02:18.783 --> 02:02:22.063
MATT: Moving your speed will get you right up to
the edge there, so it's just out of 30 feet.

02:02:22.063 --> 02:02:23.197
LIAM: Just out of 30 feet.

02:02:23.197 --> 02:02:24.332
MATT: Sorry.

02:02:24.332 --> 02:02:31.410
LIAM: I am going to cast Magic Missile at level
three because he's got my little friend.

02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:32.743
MATT: That's five missiles?

02:02:32.743 --> 02:02:35.650
LIAM: That is five missiles total. Here we go.

02:02:35.650 --> 02:02:40.266
MATT: Trudging through the swamp, cast the spell,
and then release. The five missiles all impacting

02:02:40.266 --> 02:02:42.697
at once.

02:02:42.697 --> 02:02:46.877
MARISHA: Well, wow.

02:02:46.877 --> 02:02:48.153
LAURA: Nice, nice.

02:02:48.153 --> 02:02:49.474
TRAVIS: Natural 20 on that.

02:02:49.474 --> 02:02:50.770
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:02:50.770 --> 02:02:52.008
MATT: Broken clock.

02:02:52.008 --> 02:02:54.505
LIAM: Total of 18, so (firing noises).

02:02:54.505 --> 02:03:00.703
MATT: Along its side of it, it's still holding
Nott in its mouth, and Nott's muffled screaming

02:03:00.703 --> 02:03:05.599
from inside of its jaws as it swings her back and
forth. It seems singularly focused on destroying

02:03:05.599 --> 02:03:09.503
whatever it has its mouth on. It's a beast. That
finishes your turn, Caleb?

02:03:09.503 --> 02:03:11.398
LIAM: (yelling) Disappointed!

02:03:11.398 --> 02:03:12.836
MATT: Nott, it's your turn.

02:03:12.836 --> 02:03:14.254
LAURA: Oh gosh, Nott.

02:03:14.254 --> 02:03:18.013
SAM: I use my first action to try and resist the
grapple and escape.

02:03:18.013 --> 02:03:26.291
MATT: I need you to contest it. It's an escape DC
of 16; it's athletics or acrobatics, your choice.

02:03:26.291 --> 02:03:29.061
SAM: (stuttering)

02:03:29.061 --> 02:03:30.375
LAURA: Acrobatics.

02:03:30.375 --> 02:03:31.966
SAM: Yes, whatever's-- yes, Acrobatics.

02:03:31.966 --> 02:03:33.385
MATT: Make the check.

02:03:33.385 --> 02:03:35.048
SAM: Ooh, 18.

02:03:35.048 --> 02:03:40.505
MATT: 18 is enough. You manage to just squeeze out
of its jaws and land back on the ground where you

02:03:40.505 --> 02:03:45.126
are, slipping out a brief moment of its opening
and get there. There's blood streaked down, you

02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:47.827
can feel the pain from the teeth that have been
digging into your body.

02:03:47.827 --> 02:03:50.804
SAM: Is it engaged with Beau? Can I get a sneak
attack on it?

02:03:50.804 --> 02:03:51.994
MATT: It would, yeah.

02:03:51.994 --> 02:03:55.048
SAM: Okay, great. I will shoot it in the face. Ooh,
not great. 12.

02:03:55.048 --> 02:03:59.806
MATT: 12 misses. You pull out, and from being
shaken around you're a bit dizzy and the pain

02:03:59.806 --> 02:04:03.464
swelters in your body, and as you go to fire it
ricochets off of its hide.

02:04:03.464 --> 02:04:05.278
LIAM: Is he flanked with Yasha?

02:04:05.278 --> 02:04:07.070
MATT: Right now?

02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:08.739
LAURA: Oh.

02:04:08.739 --> 02:04:10.007
SAM: What's that mean?

02:04:10.007 --> 02:04:11.274
LIAM: Advantage.

02:04:11.274 --> 02:04:15.363
MATT: Technically, yes actually.

02:04:15.363 --> 02:04:16.696
LIAM: Roll again.

02:04:16.696 --> 02:04:17.802
SAM: Cool.

02:04:17.802 --> 02:04:19.172
TALIESIN: Good man.

02:04:19.172 --> 02:04:20.085
SAM: 17.

02:04:20.085 --> 02:04:22.339
MATT: 17 does hit, roll damage.

02:04:22.339 --> 02:04:28.703
SAM: Oh wow. Okay, that's a hit. Ooh, they're all
bad. 12.

02:04:28.703 --> 02:04:34.622
MATT: 12 points of damage, sneak attack. The first
strike hits underneath the throat, slips into a

02:04:34.622 --> 02:04:39.244
piece of its already open, cracked, heavy hide and
it-- (growls).

02:04:39.244 --> 02:04:47.342
SAM: If that was one side of the throat, I'll go
for the other side. Oh, terrible, 11.

02:04:47.342 --> 02:04:48.926
LAURA: But you still get advantage because you
flanked!

02:04:48.926 --> 02:04:51.105
SAM: Oh, still advantage, or that's just once a
turn?

02:04:51.105 --> 02:04:52.806
MATT: It's advantage on every strike.

02:04:52.806 --> 02:04:55.936
SAM: Oh, wow, okay. That hits! That's an 18.

02:04:55.936 --> 02:05:01.233
MATT: That's better, roll damage for that one.
This rollercoaster, the emotions.

02:05:01.233 --> 02:05:03.258
LIAM: It's like the Simpsons Frogurt scene.

02:05:03.258 --> 02:05:04.608
MATT: I know.

02:05:04.608 --> 02:05:06.155
SAM: Five more points of damage.

02:05:06.155 --> 02:05:07.660
MATT: Five points of damage.

02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:11.849
MARISHA: Question, would this trigger my reaction
for Sentinel?

02:05:11.849 --> 02:05:16.287
MATT: No, because it's not attacking anything
that's outside of you.

02:05:16.287 --> 02:05:17.600
MARISHA: Okay.

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:19.733
SAM: But it might in a second, because I'm going
to run behind that tree.

02:05:19.733 --> 02:05:24.787
MARISHA: Okay, okay! That's good to know. Oh, this
is Nott's turn.

02:05:24.787 --> 02:05:25.744
MATT: Correct.

02:05:25.744 --> 02:05:26.467
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:05:26.467 --> 02:05:27.361
MATT: No worries.

02:05:27.361 --> 02:05:30.523
SAM: I'm going to get away. Get away as fast and
as far as I can.

02:05:30.523 --> 02:05:31.756
MATT: Away from over here?

02:05:31.756 --> 02:05:34.026
SAM: Sure. Any way you think it won't see me.

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:38.300
MATT: That's as far as you can get right there. It
does try and snatch its jaws towards you in the

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:41.758
process. That's a natural 20.

02:05:41.758 --> 02:05:44.268
LAURA: No!

02:05:44.268 --> 02:05:45.519
SAM: That hits.

02:05:45.519 --> 02:05:48.070
TALIESIN: God damn it.

02:05:48.070 --> 02:05:51.575
TRAVIS: Roll it and be proud. Ooh!

02:05:51.575 --> 02:05:53.485
MATT: That's an eight, nine, and a five.

02:05:53.485 --> 02:05:55.373
SAM: I will use my--

02:05:55.373 --> 02:05:57.822
LAURA: Oh, you get Uncanny Dodge again?

02:05:57.822 --> 02:06:00.487
MATT: 23 plus five. 28 points of piercing damage.

02:06:00.487 --> 02:06:03.487
SAM: Wait, can I use Uncanny Dodge again because
it's gone around?

02:06:03.497 --> 02:06:04.846
MATT: You can use it once per round, yeah.

02:06:04.846 --> 02:06:06.630
SAM: Yeah, uncanny dodge to make it 14.

02:06:06.654 --> 02:06:13.414
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage, however, you
are grappled in its jaws.

02:06:13.468 --> 02:06:15.553
SAM: (yelling) Again? I just got out!

02:06:15.639 --> 02:06:23.012
MATT: I know, but as you try and break away--
We're talking like Deep Blue Sea, Samuel L.

02:06:23.012 --> 02:06:28.788
Jackson. As you run away the jaws grab and pull
you back and you're being held and shaken again.

02:06:28.788 --> 02:06:30.010
LAURA: No!

02:06:30.010 --> 02:06:31.550
MARISHA: Now do I get that opportunity attack?

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:32.476
MATT: Now you do, yes.

02:06:32.476 --> 02:06:35.016
LIAM: Oh, just when I think I'm out, they pull me
back in.

02:06:35.016 --> 02:06:40.262
MATT: As it strikes out and grapples Nott in the
jaws, you do manage to get one swing at it.

02:06:40.262 --> 02:06:46.569
MARISHA: I whack it right in the nose, because
that's what I was taught with bears. I go: No!

02:06:46.569 --> 02:06:49.625
SAM and LAURA: Sharks, and bears.

02:06:49.625 --> 02:06:51.729
MATT: A lot of sharks in Kamordah, it's a thing.

02:06:51.729 --> 02:06:55.546
MARISHA: They're all the same, in the nose.
Natural 20!

02:06:55.546 --> 02:06:59.756
MATT: Oh, shit! Roll some damage on that.

02:06:59.756 --> 02:07:05.036
MARISHA: Be high! Okay! 12 damage?

02:07:05.036 --> 02:07:07.770
LIAM: Sure.

02:07:07.770 --> 02:07:14.827
MATT: 12 points of damage, all right. Crack! You
hit it right across the snout, and upon the impact

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:20.461
its eyes go dazed for a second but it continues to
chew. It's still standing. That finishes Nott's

02:07:20.461 --> 02:07:28.378
turn? All right. The one standing croc is going to
drop Nott out of its jaws--

02:07:28.378 --> 02:07:30.544
SAM: Oh, that's nice of him.

02:07:30.544 --> 02:07:32.505
MATT: And attempt to bite again.

02:07:32.505 --> 02:07:35.189
TALIESIN: Blood Curse of the Eyeless, amplified.

02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:40.078
MATT: Curse of the Eyeless amplified. Actually
before it bites, it's going to swing with its

02:07:40.078 --> 02:07:43.574
tail. It's going to spin around and attempt to
slam you with its tail. That's disadvantage on

02:07:43.574 --> 02:07:52.104
that strike. That's cocked. Cocked again.
Disadvantage. Even with disadvantage that's a 20.

02:07:52.104 --> 02:07:54.680
SAM: Yeah, that hits.

02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:59.403
MATT: The tail hits you. That's 2d8.

02:07:59.403 --> 02:08:05.034
TRAVIS: No, no, no. Shame on you DM. No more.

02:08:05.034 --> 02:08:07.060
LIAM: This one, not this one.

02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.259
MATT: That's 18 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:08:08.259 --> 02:08:09.131
LAURA: Oh no!

02:08:09.131 --> 02:08:12.561
SAM: Out.

02:08:12.561 --> 02:08:16.451
MATT You are knocked prone and it's going to try
and bite you. That's what it was doing on its turn.

02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:19.157
TALIESIN: Disadvantage.

02:08:19.157 --> 02:08:21.817
MATT: I know. But it has advantage on a prone
creature.

02:08:21.817 --> 02:08:22.934
LAURA: So it's even.

02:08:22.934 --> 02:08:23.880
TRAVIS: Regular roll.

02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:27.532
ALL: (to the tune of "Breaking the Law") Regular
roll, regular roll.

02:08:27.532 --> 02:08:29.227
MATT: That's a 17 to hit, what's your armor
class?

02:08:29.227 --> 02:08:30.378
SAM: It's 18 now.

02:08:30.378 --> 02:08:31.710
LIAM: Yes!

02:08:31.710 --> 02:08:34.531
SAM: Because of the Haste, but I don't know, I'm
dead. Do I have Haste if I'm unconscious?

02:08:34.531 --> 02:08:37.429
LAURA: But he's the one that cast--

02:08:37.429 --> 02:08:39.806
LIAM: But does an unmoving body move?

02:08:39.806 --> 02:08:42.189
MATT: I'm going to make a quick call here.

02:08:42.189 --> 02:08:44.052
SAM: You're calling someone?

02:08:44.052 --> 02:08:47.665
MATT: No. I'm calling Jeremy Crawford to
confirmation.

02:08:47.665 --> 02:08:54.687
MARISHA: He's going to phone a friend, but in the
case the friend is Nathan Stewart. "Hey, Chris Perkins?"

02:08:54.687 --> 02:08:57.984
LIAM: (Regis Philbin imitation) Would you like to
phone a WotC friend?

02:08:57.984 --> 02:09:04.944
TALIESIN: If you were just prone, he would still
have it, so if the spell is still active.

02:09:04.944 --> 02:09:07.390
LIAM: Matthew Mercer. How do you want to do this?

02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:10.644
SAM: The spell is active because it makes you
faster.

02:09:10.644 --> 02:09:14.258
MATT: I know, it's still active by rules as
written, I guess.

02:09:14.258 --> 02:09:19.059
LIAM: Maybe she's vibrating on the ground. Like
when a pager goes off.

02:09:19.059 --> 02:09:22.776
MATT: Yeah, spells end when they say they end.

02:09:22.776 --> 02:09:27.977
SAM: This feels wrong. Do it, just do it, I'll
take it.

02:09:27.977 --> 02:09:31.854
MATT: You don't want to. You don't want to take
it. Well hold on.

02:09:31.854 --> 02:09:41.894
TRAVIS: He's looking at the Great Wall. He rarely
references the Great Wall.

02:09:42.717 --> 02:09:48.333
MATT: Rarely references the Great Wall? No, that's
a 17 still, so with the Haste bonus, that would

02:09:48.333 --> 02:09:52.912
still miss yeah. So here's what happens. As you
fall unconscious--

02:09:52.912 --> 02:09:54.422
SAM: I don't feel right about this.

02:09:54.422 --> 02:09:58.965
MATT: As you fall unconscious, your form is
blurring slightly from the impact, and as you

02:09:58.965 --> 02:10:03.324
tumble, and it goes to strike and bite you, you're
tumbling backward at such a speed, still under the

02:10:03.324 --> 02:10:08.739
effect of the spell carrying you, that you fall
out of grasp of its jaws as you spin and spill out

02:10:08.739 --> 02:10:15.098
of its mouth as the teeth clamp. Plummeting to the
ground. Not taking a critical hit and immediately

02:10:15.098 --> 02:10:16.570
failing two death saving throws.

02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:18.595
LIAM: Good narration DM. Good narration.

02:10:18.595 --> 02:10:22.360
SAM: I even die fast.

02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.916
TALIESIN: Yeah this is low level, there wouldn't
really be much bringing you back.

02:10:24.916 --> 02:10:26.398
That'd be the end of it.

02:10:26.398 --> 02:10:27.331
LAURA: I have Revivify.

02:10:27.331 --> 02:10:30.410
MATT: Do you have any 300 gold diamonds?

02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:34.627
LAURA: I have lots of rings, do any of them have
diamonds in them?

02:10:34.627 --> 02:10:36.716
MATT: Not worth 300 gold.

02:10:36.716 --> 02:10:38.630
LAURA: How dare you!

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:41.785
MATT: I'm just saying, you got to buy your spell
components.

02:10:41.785 --> 02:10:43.871
LAURA: I thought if I had my symbol of the
Traveler!

02:10:43.871 --> 02:10:45.449
MATT: No.

02:10:45.449 --> 02:10:47.313
LAURA: I've never done this before.

02:10:47.313 --> 02:10:51.025
MATT: Laura. It's okay. Components that cost
money, you have to purchase,

02:10:51.025 --> 02:10:52.690
like his diamond and his incense.

02:10:52.690 --> 02:10:53.820
LIAM: Ja, hallo.

02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:56.130
LAURA: Do you have a diamond that's worth 300
gold?

02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:58.488
LIAM: It's worth 100, which is what I need for my
spell, ja.

02:10:58.488 --> 02:11:00.422
TALIESIN: Not three.

02:11:00.422 --> 02:11:05.250
LAURA: Don't die anyone, don't die. I thought I
could bring you back. Why do I have that stupid

02:11:05.250 --> 02:11:07.867
spell prepared if I can't even use it?

02:11:07.867 --> 02:11:10.736
TRAVIS and MATT: That's a good question.

02:11:10.736 --> 02:11:13.806
MARISHA: It's the chalice dilemma.

02:11:13.806 --> 02:11:15.064
MATT: Yeah.

02:11:15.064 --> 02:11:17.474
MARISHA: Hero's Feast with the chalices.

02:11:17.474 --> 02:11:24.523
MATT: Well, that finishes the croc's turn. As the
Haste spell snatches Nott from the jaws of almost

02:11:24.523 --> 02:11:27.795
imminent death, Fjord you're up.

02:11:27.795 --> 02:11:33.174
TRAVIS: I fucking see Nott fucking ragdolling all
over the place. I'll use the rest of my speed to

02:11:33.174 --> 02:11:35.130
get as close as I can.

02:11:35.130 --> 02:11:36.555
MATT: That gets you up onto the battlefield
there.

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:38.667
TRAVIS: Does that put me within 30 feet of that
croc?

02:11:38.667 --> 02:11:42.561
MATT: It puts you within 35 feet, it's just out of
30 foot range.

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:45.677
TRAVIS: I'm 35 feet away?

02:11:45.677 --> 02:11:46.779
MATT: Yeah.

02:11:46.779 --> 02:11:48.640
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me.

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:50.191
LIAM: Ain't you got no long range?

02:11:50.191 --> 02:11:52.406
MATT: Sometimes it doesn't help to lag.

02:11:52.406 --> 02:11:56.262
TRAVIS: I just wanted to a little Witch Bolt. Two
more Eldritch Blasts going at it.

02:11:56.262 --> 02:11:57.707
MATT: Go for it, roll for the attacks.

02:11:57.707 --> 02:12:00.060
TRAVIS: That is a 16 to hit.

02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:01.938
MATT: 16 hits.

02:12:01.938 --> 02:12:06.754
TRAVIS: Oh great, I thought it missed. That's not
going to do it, that's 13.

02:12:06.754 --> 02:12:07.776
MATT: 13 just misses.

02:12:07.776 --> 02:12:10.282
TRAVIS: That's ten plus four for 14 points of
damage.

02:12:10.282 --> 02:12:11.461
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:12:11.461 --> 02:12:13.713
(cheering)

02:12:13.713 --> 02:12:14.978
LAURA: Look at you.

02:12:14.978 --> 02:12:20.705
TRAVIS: I'll look at that nice piece of luggage
and I'll say: Nott today.

02:12:20.705 --> 02:12:23.920
(groaning)

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:28.497
SAM: I just failed two death saves from that pun.

02:12:28.497 --> 02:12:32.415
LAURA: He literally marked them off.

02:12:32.415 --> 02:12:38.947
MATT: Both of the impacts of the Eldritch Blasts
hit it, it's still up on the rock after snatching

02:12:38.947 --> 02:12:43.276
its jaw in the air and missing Nott as she tumbles
out of it, the head comes down and turns towards

02:12:43.276 --> 02:12:49.703
you. As its jaws open, both-- up into the throat.
You watch as the back of its head bursts behind

02:12:49.703 --> 02:12:56.056
it. Its eyes go dull before it slumps over the
rock and it slowly slides into the edge of the

02:12:56.056 --> 02:12:57.989
swamp nearby.

02:12:57.989 --> 02:13:00.068
SAM: You got the kill? You were barely in the
fight!

02:13:00.068 --> 02:13:06.498
LAURA: No, he totally came! He's good, he's a
hero! Can I use my invoked Jester, my duplicate,

02:13:06.498 --> 02:13:09.424
to run over to Nott? She can move 30 feet.

02:13:09.424 --> 02:13:10.856
MATT: She can, yeah.

02:13:10.856 --> 02:13:14.648
LAURA: It wouldn't be encumbered because--

02:13:14.648 --> 02:13:17.892
MATT: She's an illusion. Correct. Here, in this
instance, the illusion would not, I don't think,

02:13:17.892 --> 02:13:19.877
be affected by the rough terrain.

02:13:19.877 --> 02:13:23.740
LAURA: Wonderful, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on
you.

02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:25.307
MATT: There you go.

02:13:25.307 --> 02:13:26.808
LAURA: At, you know--

02:13:26.808 --> 02:13:28.653
SAM: The lowest level possible.

02:13:28.653 --> 02:13:37.951
LAURA: At second level. We're about to get a rest,
it seems stupid to-- oh, it's cocked. Five plus

02:13:37.951 --> 02:13:46.920
four. No. It would be plus four, plus four? No,
it's 2d8 plus four.

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:49.416
MATT: Correct, at 2nd-level.

02:13:49.416 --> 02:13:51.077
LAURA: Okay yeah, nine.

02:13:51.077 --> 02:13:53.421
MATT: That heals you up there, you come to
consciousness, Nott.

02:13:53.421 --> 02:14:03.871
SAM: That was scary, I should not have been this
close. Where were you? I was doing everything up there!

02:14:04.067 --> 02:14:08.564
TRAVIS: Look, look, I'm up to my fucking knees in
this quagmire, all right? It's a slop dolly of

02:14:08.564 --> 02:14:10.308
epic proportions!

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:12.443
SAM: A slop dolly?!

02:14:12.443 --> 02:14:16.001
LAURA: Can I jump down and walk over to the little
bird creature?

02:14:16.001 --> 02:14:18.512
TRAVIS: Fucking Kentucky knows what I'm talking
about.

02:14:18.512 --> 02:14:19.992
SAM: What's a slop dolly?

02:14:19.992 --> 02:14:20.936
TRAVIS: We're in it!

02:14:20.936 --> 02:14:22.841
LAURA: You guys!

02:14:22.841 --> 02:14:27.513
MATT: You guys take a moment, finish yelling at
each other. Jester has jumped down from the tree,

02:14:27.513 --> 02:14:34.890
calls your attention. There, still struggling in
the marsh, you see the small, black feathered bird

02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:39.613
creature. And we're going to take a break because
it's 9:14, so let's take a quick break. We'll pick

02:14:39.613 --> 02:14:45.526
up right at that moment in a few moments. I'm
going to sit down because I can do that right now.

02:14:45.526 --> 02:14:50.222
We'll be back here in just a moment, guys. We do
have our Wyrmwood giveaway for the evening. We

02:14:50.222 --> 02:14:59.013
have, what is it, kalimantan ebony tabletop dice
tray. This is the pretty awesome dark wood with

02:14:59.013 --> 02:15:00.015
the leather in it.

02:15:00.015 --> 02:15:01.621
MARISHA: Oh yes.

02:15:01.621 --> 02:15:06.962
MATT: This one is gorgeous. That one is going to
be there for one of our winners during the break.

02:15:06.962 --> 02:15:12.321
For those of you who are in the US and Canada,
except for Quebec, you can enter this over the

02:15:12.321 --> 02:15:20.836
break, by coming into the Twitch chat and entering
the word "Marsh." Only enter it once, more than

02:15:20.836 --> 02:15:24.395
once and you'll be disqualified and we'll come
back with a winner as soon as we return. See you

02:15:24.395 --> 02:15:26.814
guys in a minute.

02:15:26.814 --> 02:15:30.749
MATT: And welcome back everybody. Before we get
back into the game, we have the winner of our

02:15:30.749 --> 02:15:36.014
fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway from the break:
akpresto. Akpresto, congratulations, you won the

02:15:36.014 --> 02:15:43.620
awesome, awesome-wood-full game dice tray from
Wyrmwood. We'll get that to you ASAP, thank you

02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:46.779
for coming in and everybody else who jumped into
the chat.

02:15:46.779 --> 02:15:50.635
MARISHA: It smells a little like tuna, and that's
not me, though.

02:15:50.635 --> 02:15:51.832
MATT: That's disgusting.

02:15:51.832 --> 02:15:53.356
LAURA: Ew!

02:15:53.356 --> 02:15:55.476
TRAVIS: You can't burp and then try to blame the
smell on somebody else.

02:15:55.476 --> 02:15:57.384
MARISHA: I'm telling you.

02:15:57.384 --> 02:15:58.823
LAURA: That's really foul.

02:15:58.823 --> 02:16:00.313
LIAM: Out of context quotes.

02:16:00.313 --> 02:16:01.285
MATT: Guys!

02:16:01.285 --> 02:16:05.136
SAM: Oh, sorry Matt, is there something you'd like
to discuss with the table?

02:16:05.136 --> 02:16:08.278
MATT: Yeah!

02:16:08.278 --> 02:16:12.511
LIAM: A purple worm erupts from the middle of the
floor--

02:16:12.511 --> 02:16:19.158
MATT: Don't tempt me. You guys all take a moment,
tend to your exhaustion from plunging into this

02:16:19.158 --> 02:16:24.806
swamp haphazardly, some of you taking quite a
beating in the process. Jester guides your

02:16:24.806 --> 02:16:30.962
attention to this now struggling small bird
creature. It looks to be about the size of a an

02:16:30.962 --> 02:16:37.316
adolescent child, maybe no more than-- well, let's
say a little younger than that, maybe like an

02:16:37.316 --> 02:16:43.323
eight or nine year old. But instead of skin, it's
just black feathers. No wings really, the feathers

02:16:43.323 --> 02:16:49.440
are too small among the arm to actually be
flight-ready. The lower half of its body is still

02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:55.970
sunken and thick in the bog. It has, where its
face is, two bright yellow eyes, very crow,

02:16:55.970 --> 02:17:01.668
raven-like eyes and a long black pointed beak. And
(scared bird croaking).

02:17:01.668 --> 02:17:03.396
LAURA: Don't worry! I can help you.

02:17:03.396 --> 02:17:05.360
MATT: (scared chirping)

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:06.379
LAURA: Give me your hands.

02:17:06.379 --> 02:17:09.675
MATT: (chirping)

02:17:09.675 --> 02:17:11.918
LAURA: Oh! I lift it up out.

02:17:11.918 --> 02:17:13.671
MATT: Make a strength check

02:17:13.671 --> 02:17:15.828
SAM: Arms. Out of sockets.

02:17:15.828 --> 02:17:17.860
LIAM: Caleb is watching all this.

02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:19.627
LAURA: 20.

02:17:19.627 --> 02:17:24.011
MATT: 20. With just a few moments, though your
legs sink in a bit, you manage to pull, find

02:17:24.016 --> 02:17:28.649
leverage, grab onto some of the heavy vines on the
side, and you manage to pull this creature out

02:17:29.090 --> 02:17:35.990
from the bog, until eventually it gets its legs
free, and as it pulls its way up to the top, it

02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:40.755
begins to shrug off the thick bog slop that was
keeping it stuck there in the center of the opening.

02:17:40.755 --> 02:17:43.439
MARISHA: It is a bird person.

02:17:43.439 --> 02:17:44.932
LAURA: Right?

02:17:44.932 --> 02:17:45.692
MATT: (chirping)

02:17:45.692 --> 02:17:47.203
LAURA: Can you understand us?

02:17:47.203 --> 02:17:48.488
MATT: (chirping)

02:17:48.488 --> 02:17:52.981
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Do you live around here?

02:17:52.981 --> 02:17:54.163
MATT: (like Jester) "Do you live around here?"

02:17:54.163 --> 02:17:55.588
(gasping)

02:17:55.588 --> 02:17:58.812
ASHLEY: It's like a mockingjay.

02:17:58.812 --> 02:18:01.035
LAURA: What is your name?

02:18:01.035 --> 02:18:06.574
MATT: (chirping)

02:18:06.574 --> 02:18:10.397
SAM: Maybe it was separated from its parents or
something?

02:18:10.397 --> 02:18:13.510
LAURA: Maybe. Are you an adult or are you a kid?

02:18:13.510 --> 02:18:15.144
MATT: (like Jester) "A kid."

02:18:15.144 --> 02:18:17.138
LAURA: A kid.

02:18:17.138 --> 02:18:21.913
ASHLEY: I love him!

02:18:21.913 --> 02:18:28.458
LIAM: I could, it would take an hour, but I could
understand this one, if I set my mind to it.

02:18:28.458 --> 02:18:29.346
ASHLEY: You could get a rest.

02:18:29.346 --> 02:18:31.563
SAM: Where do you live?

02:18:31.563 --> 02:18:38.751
MATT: (chirping) And points its still soggy,
feathered arm, to the east.

02:18:38.751 --> 02:18:40.977
LAURA: Close by?

02:18:40.977 --> 02:18:43.215
MATT: (chirping)

02:18:43.215 --> 02:18:44.921
LAURA: How did you get here?

02:18:44.921 --> 02:18:53.768
MATT: (chirping). Looks towards you, and starts
walking up towards you, pulls open your coat.

02:18:53.768 --> 02:18:58.801
Starts rummaging through, pulls one of the
books--

02:18:58.801 --> 02:19:03.824
LIAM: Oh! No. No, please. No, please, no.

02:19:03.824 --> 02:19:07.387
MATT: (like Caleb) "Please no."

02:19:07.387 --> 02:19:09.867
LIAM: I'm going to pull my coat shut.

02:19:09.867 --> 02:19:12.327
LAURA: Maybe you should learn how to speak to him.

02:19:12.327 --> 02:19:14.775
SAM: Maybe it wants some paper.

02:19:14.775 --> 02:19:17.231
TALIESIN: Where's your book?

02:19:17.231 --> 02:19:19.817
LAURA: Oh! Can you write?

02:19:19.817 --> 02:19:22.563
LIAM: Or does he want to draw.

02:19:22.563 --> 02:19:24.839
LAURA: I pull out my journal.

02:19:24.839 --> 02:19:26.372
TALIESIN: I've got a theory.

02:19:26.372 --> 02:19:27.754
MARISHA: Maybe he only repeats what we say.

02:19:27.754 --> 02:19:33.031
MATT: Begins to write into the book, and shows it
to you. It says, "Thank you."

02:19:33.031 --> 02:19:38.554
LAURA: Oh, you're welcome so much! How old are
you? What's your name?

02:19:39.892 --> 02:19:45.609
MATT: It says "four," the number four. The name is
"Kiri."

02:19:45.609 --> 02:19:47.510
LAURA and SAM: Kiri?

02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:52.658
LAURA: Kiri, you're four years old?

02:19:52.658 --> 02:19:54.676
MATT: (chirping)

02:19:54.676 --> 02:19:57.156
LAURA: That's so wonderful.

02:19:57.156 --> 02:20:02.102
TALIESIN: What were you doing here? What is this
place?

02:20:02.102 --> 02:20:13.956
MATT: Begins writing out an extended statement in
the paper. Puts out to you and it says; "Family

02:20:13.956 --> 02:20:23.082
"going west. Traveling. Escaping east mountains.
Skies go dark there. Father said the valley folk fighting."

02:20:23.082 --> 02:20:26.062
LAURA: They are. There's a big fight going on.

02:20:26.062 --> 02:20:28.298
ASHLEY: Where's your--

02:20:28.298 --> 02:20:33.041
MARISHA: How far have you traveled? Do you
recognize people that look like her?

02:20:33.041 --> 02:20:35.688
MATT: (chirping)

02:20:35.688 --> 02:20:38.552
LAURA: Where is your family now?

02:20:38.552 --> 02:20:41.137
MATT: (sad chirping)

02:20:41.137 --> 02:20:50.835
LAURA: Oh no, no, no! Are your Momma &amp;amp; Dad okay?
No?

02:20:50.835 --> 02:20:51.831
MATT: (chirping)

02:20:51.831 --> 02:20:56.084
LAURA: You don't know where they went? How did you
get separated?

02:20:57.839 --> 02:21:01.000
MATT: Begins writing another small essay, in the
book.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.541
LAURA: We should keep an eye out. To make sure no
more of those things come out.

02:21:03.541 --> 02:21:05.117
TRAVIS: I'll keep an eye out.

02:21:05.117 --> 02:21:06.256
ASHLEY: Same.

02:21:06.308 --> 02:21:08.876
MATT: Make a perception check. One of you. Take it
with advantage.

02:21:08.876 --> 02:21:11.858
MARISHA: Matt seems adamant. That can't be good.

02:21:11.858 --> 02:21:13.580
ASHLEY: We both roll, but--?

02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:18.991
MATT: One of you is aiding the other. Unless you
want to make two separate rolls. It's up to you.

02:21:18.991 --> 02:21:20.501
TRAVIS: Let's do two separate rolls.

02:21:20.501 --> 02:21:22.525
MATT: All right. Go for it.

02:21:23.323 --> 02:21:24.905
TRAVIS: 14.

02:21:24.905 --> 02:21:26.589
ASHLEY: 16.

02:21:26.589 --> 02:21:29.447
MATT: Okay. You guys are keeping an eye out in the
space around you.

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:32.134
TALIESIN: I'm going to peruse these ruins a little
bit, see what they are and what they look like.

02:21:32.134 --> 02:21:36.842
MATT: Make an investigation check. (chirp)
Finishes writing and shows it over, it says,

02:21:36.842 --> 02:21:46.863
"Swamp was to hide us. Swamp folk saw us. So we
ran to not be taken. I wasn't watching and the bog

02:21:46.863 --> 02:21:55.677
"caught me. Family couldn't pull free. Couldn't
risk sisters or selves, so kept going."

02:21:55.677 --> 02:21:58.641
LAURA: Oh no!

02:21:58.641 --> 02:22:06.300
MATT: "Stuck here for a while. Not their fault.
Don't want them to die for my carelessness."

02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:10.418
Closes the book (chirps).

02:22:10.418 --> 02:22:12.631
LAURA: (sadly) We've got to get him to his family.

02:22:12.631 --> 02:22:14.032
TALIESIN: Do you know where they are heading?

02:22:14.032 --> 02:22:15.444
SAM: It's a him?

02:22:15.444 --> 02:22:16.844
MATT: (chirps)

02:22:16.844 --> 02:22:17.835
LAURA: Oh, I don't know. Are you a--

02:22:17.835 --> 02:22:20.846
SAM: A boy bird, or a girl bird, or just a bird
bird?

02:22:20.846 --> 02:22:22.525
TALIESIN: A word bird.

02:22:22.525 --> 02:22:24.324
MATT: "Girl."

02:22:24.853 --> 02:22:32.072
LAURA: Girl bird! Kiri! Oh no. How many sisters do
you have?

02:22:32.072 --> 02:22:38.186
MATT: Puts up four fingers with long, exaggerated
feathered fingertips.

02:22:38.186 --> 02:22:46.270
MARISHA: Would I recognize what species or race of
people?

02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:48.823
MATT: You haven't encountered these people before.

02:22:48.823 --> 02:22:51.031
LIAM: Empire kids wouldn't know?

02:22:51.031 --> 02:22:54.553
MARISHA: Empire kids wouldn't know? The whole
studied thing?

02:22:54.796 --> 02:22:58.193
MATT: You've heard of various different strange
races out there. Bird people may have crossed in a

02:22:58.193 --> 02:23:04.320
story before but-- You've done a little bit of
study. Make a nature check for you, Caleb, since

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:07.965
you studied in this area, just general knowledge.

02:23:07.965 --> 02:23:09.450
ASHLEY: I've never seen them before?

02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:11.359
LIAM and MATT: Natural 20.

02:23:11.359 --> 02:23:12.407
LIAM: Kenku.

02:23:12.407 --> 02:23:22.067
MATT: Kenku, yes, you know. They're usually very
removed. Location-wise, they usually exist on the

02:23:22.067 --> 02:23:30.819
far outskirts of the Empire if anywhere. They have
small family units that live on their own. There

02:23:30.819 --> 02:23:36.314
isn't so much of a kenku culture they belong to.
They're small little groups. They look out for themselves.

02:23:36.314 --> 02:23:40.188
LIAM: Like ravens, they are able to mimic many
sounds.

02:23:40.188 --> 02:23:43.851
MATT: Correct. As part of their history, and you
rolled a natural 20 so you know quite a bit,

02:23:43.851 --> 02:23:50.753
something in their lineage, there was a curse
involved. Something based around the time of their

02:23:50.753 --> 02:23:55.237
creation, where their ability to converse was
taken from them.

02:23:55.237 --> 02:23:57.012
LIAM: I mutter that to the group.

02:23:57.012 --> 02:24:00.837
LAURA: (quietly) Oh man.

02:24:00.837 --> 02:24:07.465
TRAVIS: Kiri, have you happened to see a safe
house, or a building or a structure around while

02:24:07.465 --> 02:24:08.903
you were fleeing?

02:24:08.903 --> 02:24:11.606
MATT: (chirping)

02:24:11.606 --> 02:24:15.875
LAURA: Where did you see the swamp people that you
were talking about?

02:24:15.875 --> 02:24:20.086
MATT: She points in a northeastern direction.

02:24:20.086 --> 02:24:24.679
SAM: But your family went the other way? To the
west?

02:24:24.679 --> 02:24:28.979
TRAVIS: The way we came from? We could always give
her a horse--

02:24:28.979 --> 02:24:30.996
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking.

02:24:30.996 --> 02:24:37.205
MATT: Writes on the page, spins it around, it says
"Nowhere to go. Can I come with you?"

02:24:37.205 --> 02:24:42.243
LIAM: Are you able to handle yourself in a scrap?
Are you good with a weapon, or--

02:24:42.243 --> 02:24:45.080
SAM: She's four.

02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:47.415
LAURA: Well, you're how old?

02:24:47.415 --> 02:24:51.899
SAM: I don't really know, but I'm twice her age at
least!

02:24:51.899 --> 02:24:58.257
LAURA: She's got really good penmanship, so I
don't think she's four like human four. Most

02:24:58.257 --> 02:25:00.369
four-year-olds can't write like that.

02:25:00.369 --> 02:25:01.547
SAM: That's true.

02:25:01.547 --> 02:25:04.642
TALIESIN: Where we're going is a bit dangerous, we
should warn you.

02:25:04.642 --> 02:25:10.348
LIAM: To my question though, are you able to
handle yourself in a dangerous moment in any way?

02:25:10.348 --> 02:25:12.928
MATT: Looks back at the bog, goes--

02:25:15.088 --> 02:25:16.522
SAM: Oh!

02:25:16.601 --> 02:25:17.611
LIAM: A monk.

02:25:17.611 --> 02:25:20.240
TRAVIS: Fearsome.

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:24.283
ASHLEY: Maybe we can keep her in the cart or
something?

02:25:24.283 --> 02:25:30.539
LAURA: Yeah. If she stays with us at least until
tomorrow, maybe I can send a message to your

02:25:30.539 --> 02:25:33.732
family and let them know you are okay.

02:25:33.732 --> 02:25:35.021
MATT: (like Jester) "I'm okay."

02:25:35.021 --> 02:25:35.930
LAURA: Right.

02:25:35.930 --> 02:25:37.408
MATT: (Chirping)

02:25:37.408 --> 02:25:40.932
TRAVIS: I reach behind my belt and pull out a
dagger and twirl it in my fingers, and hand it

02:25:40.932 --> 02:25:46.775
hilt towards Kiri. Careful, it's sharp.

02:25:46.775 --> 02:25:49.619
MATT: (like Fjord) "It's sharp."

02:25:49.619 --> 02:25:54.969
MARISHA: It's kind of creepy, man.

02:25:54.969 --> 02:25:59.911
ASHLEY: Do you have any more pocket bacon? Are you
hungry?

02:25:59.911 --> 02:26:04.388
SAM: Oh, I have a pouch of things this one might
like!

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:06.069
MARISHA: Oh yeah, you've got oats.

02:26:06.069 --> 02:26:11.413
SAM: I have dried corn and oats and things. Would
you peck on these?

02:26:11.413 --> 02:26:14.025
MATT: Holding the dagger, she goes forward and
starts pecking out of your hand.

02:26:14.025 --> 02:26:19.472
SAM: Oh, okay. Ow. Ow!

02:26:19.472 --> 02:26:23.170
LAURA: I have some pastries, too, if you like
sweets.

02:26:23.170 --> 02:26:24.556
TALIESIN: Hey Caleb, you got a second?

02:26:24.556 --> 02:26:27.828
MATT: The head turns to you as well. Takes it.

02:26:27.828 --> 02:26:28.921
LIAM: Many seconds. What do you need?

02:26:28.921 --> 02:26:32.153
TALIESIN: Take a look at this. Do these mean
anything to you? Just looking at the stone

02:26:32.153 --> 02:26:34.321
structures that are here.

02:26:34.321 --> 02:26:35.679
MATT: You rolled investigation?

02:26:35.679 --> 02:26:37.981
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight. They are stone.

02:26:37.981 --> 02:26:43.846
MATT: It looks like it's very old and has long
fallen over and has been absorbed mostly by the

02:26:43.846 --> 02:26:49.126
swamp. It doesn't look like it was a large
structure. Like it might have been a small, brief

02:26:49.126 --> 02:26:52.628
gatehouse off the path. Some sort of a watch post
that had--

02:26:52.628 --> 02:26:56.419
LIAM: Since he brought me over, what do I make of
the same?

02:26:56.419 --> 02:26:57.644
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:27:00.993 --> 02:27:03.722
LIAM: Yeah. That is a 25.

02:27:03.722 --> 02:27:10.448
MATT: Looking through it and making out the layout
of it, it was definitely a post house for Berleben

02:27:10.448 --> 02:27:16.473
when it was first made. The stones look well over
100 years old. They have long been reclaimed by

02:27:16.473 --> 02:27:23.024
the roots and vines of the swamp. Nothing special
beyond that really. Just an abandoned post.

02:27:23.024 --> 02:27:27.548
LIAM: Just looks like a bunch of old crap, to be
honest.

02:27:27.548 --> 02:27:31.265
TALIESIN: That's disappointing. I kick it.

02:27:31.265 --> 02:27:34.727
MARISHA: Let me hold this dagger for just a
moment.

02:27:34.727 --> 02:27:37.254
MATT: Hard grip on it.

02:27:37.254 --> 02:27:42.612
MARISHA: I'll give it back. I just want to test
something.

02:27:42.612 --> 02:27:45.319
TRAVIS: It's okay, Kiri.

02:27:45.319 --> 02:27:51.655
MARISHA: Okay, we're just going to test your
reflexes here.

02:27:51.655 --> 02:27:52.890
LAURA: Are you going to throw--

02:27:52.890 --> 02:28:05.415
MARISHA: No. A little sparring. Punch here, hit
here. Can you-- (punching sounds)

02:28:05.415 --> 02:28:08.030
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on her before
she does this.

02:28:08.030 --> 02:28:09.513
MATT: Okay.

02:28:09.513 --> 02:28:13.994
MARISHA: I just want to see before we give a
dagger to a child.

02:28:13.994 --> 02:28:14.904
LAURA: Eight.

02:28:14.904 --> 02:28:17.475
MATT: Natural 20!

02:28:17.475 --> 02:28:20.661
MARISHA: To attack my hand? Okay.

02:28:20.661 --> 02:28:26.546
MATT: Yeah. You take two points of damage. You're
like, "Oh!" Not bad.

02:28:26.546 --> 02:28:27.972
LAURA: A natural 20 got two points of damage?

02:28:27.972 --> 02:28:29.810
MATT: Yeah.

02:28:29.810 --> 02:28:34.763
MARISHA: I don't know if she needs a dagger. Here
you go, child.

02:28:34.763 --> 02:28:39.289
LAURA: Whoa, whoa!

02:28:39.289 --> 02:28:43.054
MARISHA: We're going to die first.

02:28:43.054 --> 02:28:46.552
LAURA: Should we cut open these giant gators and
see what they have in their bellies?

02:28:46.552 --> 02:28:49.256
TALIESIN: Let's see if we can cut them and keep
some of this leather. I bet it's worth a little

02:28:49.256 --> 02:28:50.890
bit of money.

02:28:50.890 --> 02:28:54.134
LAURA: I take my axe and hit it in the belly!

02:28:54.134 --> 02:28:56.583
MATT: You begin to carve into the two crocodiles?

02:28:56.583 --> 02:28:58.316
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll check the guts.

02:28:58.316 --> 02:29:09.922
MATT: Whoever is helming that, make a medicine
check to understand what parts of the body are

02:29:09.922 --> 02:29:16.154
most delicate. To try and open it without--

02:29:16.154 --> 02:29:18.312
TALIESIN: Choose your weapon.

02:29:18.312 --> 02:29:22.157
LAURA: Ugh. Ten.

02:29:22.157 --> 02:29:28.760
MATT: It'll take you the better part of the day to
carve off enough of the hide to really be useful

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:37.883
for trading. It's a long process, These are big
creatures. You begin to carve off some of its

02:29:37.883 --> 02:29:43.256
hide. None of you are experienced tanners, so it's
a lot of trial and error and sections of it

02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:51.264
tearing off prematurely. It's a very messy
process. Jester is like hand to elbow covered in blood.

02:29:51.264 --> 02:29:54.474
TALIESIN: Is there anything fun in the guts?

02:29:54.474 --> 02:30:02.753
MATT: Have you checked in its stomach? You find a
lot of bones, a lot of partially digested meat,

02:30:02.753 --> 02:30:05.282
and a lot of black feathers.

02:30:05.282 --> 02:30:08.827
ALL: (dismayed) Oh!

02:30:08.827 --> 02:30:11.122
LIAM: Did Jester spend hours doing that?

02:30:11.122 --> 02:30:12.285
MATT: A while, yeah.

02:30:12.285 --> 02:30:17.021
LIAM: If she did, then Caleb would have spent one
hour to cast Comprehend Languages as a ritual

02:30:17.021 --> 02:30:21.848
spell to talk to her, full on.

02:30:21.848 --> 02:30:25.011
MARISHA: Can I take a short rest, then, to get my
ki points back?

02:30:25.011 --> 02:30:26.196
MATT: Sure.

02:30:26.196 --> 02:30:31.279
LAURA: Can I realize that this was-- Would I be
able to tell from my medicine history that this is

02:30:31.279 --> 02:30:33.069
bird people?

02:30:33.069 --> 02:30:34.569
MATT: Looks to be, yeah.

02:30:34.569 --> 02:30:37.916
LAURA: Like, could you tell from the bones it's a
lot of bird people?

02:30:37.916 --> 02:30:39.296
MATT: Looks a handful.

02:30:39.296 --> 02:30:40.888
LAURA: Oh no!

02:30:40.888 --> 02:30:42.413
MARISHA: That's this kid's parents.

02:30:42.413 --> 02:30:45.141
SAM: Oh, Beau, come on--

02:30:45.141 --> 02:30:46.668
ASHLEY: Probably the rest of the family, too.

02:30:46.668 --> 02:30:48.441
MARISHA: The cousins.

02:30:48.441 --> 02:30:50.212
ASHLEY: Might be the only one, she--

02:30:50.212 --> 02:30:57.355
LIAM: I'm going to walk Kiri away from this for
the moment and say, after an hour has passed of me

02:30:57.355 --> 02:31:03.010
doing this ritual spell: For the moment, I can
understand you as clearly as you can understand

02:31:03.010 --> 02:31:09.009
me. Do you want to tell me anything about your
time in this swamp or what you want to do with

02:31:09.009 --> 02:31:15.097
yourself, now that you are alone or how we can
best help you? Or anything you want to tell me.

02:31:15.097 --> 02:31:18.749
MATT: "I don't know, I just want to get back to my
family."

02:31:18.749 --> 02:31:20.990
ASHLEY: Insight check.

02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:22.704
LIAM: Okay

02:31:22.704 --> 02:31:24.367
ASHLEY: She killed them all.

02:31:24.367 --> 02:31:35.317
LIAM: Well, in the meantime, while we are looking
for them, is there anything that we can do for you

02:31:35.317 --> 02:31:40.012
or is there anything that you can tell me about
your last days here?

02:31:40.012 --> 02:31:42.750
MATT: There is an interesting point here, let me
check something real fast here.

02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:44.023
SAM: That they don't talk.

02:31:44.023 --> 02:31:45.605
MATT: Yeah, this is going to be a point.

02:31:45.605 --> 02:31:50.007
MARISHA: Yeah, like a Rorschach test.

02:31:50.007 --> 02:31:51.918
LAURA: Can they talk to each other?

02:31:51.918 --> 02:31:54.081
TALIESIN: Hey, you can get the note.

02:31:54.081 --> 02:31:57.954
LIAM: I mean, their are hoots and whistles are
some form of language, aren't they?

02:31:57.954 --> 02:32:00.923
MARISHA: Well, he said that they were cursed, they
lost their ability.

02:32:00.923 --> 02:32:04.366
MATT: No, that's interesting. Interesting point.
After casting the spell, there is no language to

02:32:04.366 --> 02:32:09.327
understand, it's only through mimicry. You managed
to get the jist of that initial statement, through

02:32:09.327 --> 02:32:12.178
talking with it for a while, but the spell has no
effect.

02:32:12.178 --> 02:32:14.299
LAURA: Whoa.

02:32:14.299 --> 02:32:17.240
MATT: There is no spoken language.

02:32:17.240 --> 02:32:18.576
LAURA: Should we tell her?

02:32:18.576 --> 02:32:22.260
SAM: We don't know that this feathers are her
parents.

02:32:22.260 --> 02:32:27.763
MATT: Looking through with your medicine check, it
looks like there's only three between the two of them.

02:32:29.767 --> 02:32:33.565
LAURA: There's three bodies. Were they big bones
or little bones?

02:32:33.565 --> 02:32:35.050
MATT: They look to be little.

02:32:35.050 --> 02:32:38.055
MARISHA: Her sisters. Parents are alive.

02:32:38.055 --> 02:32:41.639
LAURA: Then they're really sad, and they will be
happy that one of their children--

02:32:41.639 --> 02:32:45.580
TRAVIS: What good will it do? I don't think that
we need to tell her.

02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:49.810
LAURA: Yeah, no. We won't tell her that, I was
afraid that it was her parents. But if we can let

02:32:49.810 --> 02:32:53.233
her parents know that she's okay, then at least--

02:32:53.233 --> 02:32:55.072
SAM: You said that you could send a message?

02:32:55.072 --> 02:33:03.153
LAURA: Yeah, well. The Traveler's been teaching me
some stuff and I was asking him the other night

02:33:03.153 --> 02:33:10.821
about how I could thank my mama and stuff like
that. He taught me a little bit of how to send

02:33:10.821 --> 02:33:13.246
messages across distances.

02:33:13.246 --> 02:33:18.933
SAM: Wow. But don't you need to know who you're
telling it to or something?

02:33:18.933 --> 02:33:23.658
LAURA: I don't know. I think if it's familiar
enough, then I can send it. Maybe if she describes

02:33:23.658 --> 02:33:27.196
them, I could do it. I haven't ever tried it.

02:33:27.196 --> 02:33:28.293
SAM: We should try it now.

02:33:28.293 --> 02:33:30.636
LAURA: I needed to send it to-- Oh, I have to
prepare it.

02:33:30.636 --> 02:33:32.469
SAM: Oh.

02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:37.419
TALIESIN: Let's haul this all back onto the cart
and get on our way and see where we get.

02:33:37.419 --> 02:33:40.085
ASHLEY: Her parents just left her, you know?

02:33:40.085 --> 02:33:41.838
MARISHA: We shouldn't go fighting with her.

02:33:41.838 --> 02:33:43.466
LAURA: There were three other kids, you know?

02:33:43.466 --> 02:33:44.856
TALIESIN: What do you propose we do?

02:33:44.856 --> 02:33:46.419
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:33:46.419 --> 02:33:48.072
LAURA: Blood all over my hands.

02:33:48.072 --> 02:33:50.720
MARISHA: We gave her a dagger. Point her in the
right direction that her parents are going.

02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:54.246
SAM: We can't leave her, the swamp things will
kill it.

02:33:54.246 --> 02:33:58.068
MARISHA: Well, if she comes with us, then we will
kill her.

02:33:58.068 --> 02:34:02.331
ASHLEY: What's her size?

02:34:02.331 --> 02:34:07.483
MATT: Standing at full height, maybe about three
and a half feet.

02:34:07.483 --> 02:34:09.927
MARISHA: Unless we can drop her off on the nearest
town.

02:34:09.927 --> 02:34:12.670
ASHLEY: Just going to kick her up out of the bog.

02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:14.956
LIAM: Will she be welcomed in a town?

02:34:14.956 --> 02:34:17.533
TALIESIN: Will she be welcomed anywhere?

02:34:17.533 --> 02:34:19.119
MARISHA: Exactly.

02:34:19.119 --> 02:34:24.873
LIAM: DM, you said three or four, five hours for
Jester to do all of that gator carving before?

02:34:24.873 --> 02:34:31.116
MATT: To actually harvest the actual armored hide
will get you pretty close to dusk.

02:34:31.116 --> 02:34:32.560
LIAM: And that's what you did?

02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:33.575
LAURA: Sure.

02:34:33.575 --> 02:34:37.089
LIAM: Than I use arcane recovery. That's all I
wanted to ask, if I had time.

02:34:37.089 --> 02:34:43.830
MARISHA: I don't know, guys. We've seen how people
react to Nott around here. What if we drag her in

02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:46.154
front of some crazy locals?

02:34:46.154 --> 02:34:49.401
TALIESIN: All of this are great points, but I'm
waiting for another idea.

02:34:49.401 --> 02:34:54.622
LIAM: Well, I think we should do what we have done
well so far, which is to improvise. It is better

02:34:54.622 --> 02:34:59.554
to bring her with her and then leave her and then
if we find an advantageous place to leave her,

02:34:59.554 --> 02:35:03.455
then we will. But for the time being she is a
sidekick.

02:35:03.455 --> 02:35:05.837
MATT: (like Caleb) "Sidekick."

02:35:05.837 --> 02:35:07.900
TRAVIS: Fair chance is better than none.

02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:11.736
TALIESIN: It's also possibly someone to watch the
cart while we do our businesses.

02:35:11.736 --> 02:35:14.718
LAURA: Plus, in the morning I can send a message
to your mom and dad.

02:35:14.718 --> 02:35:16.238
MATT: (like Jester) "Mom and dad."

02:35:16.238 --> 02:35:19.976
LAURA: Right. We can gift you a horse, and then
you can go find them.

02:35:19.976 --> 02:35:21.833
MATT: (chirping)

02:35:21.833 --> 02:35:23.969
TRAVIS: We should get back to the cart and at
least try to make our way into some drier--

02:35:23.969 --> 02:35:26.255
TALIESIN: To see if we can find somewhere safe.

02:35:26.255 --> 02:35:29.080
LAURA: I'll carry this leather to the cart.

02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:35.005
MATT: (like Jester) "I'll carry this leather to
the cart." She helps you to start lifting the

02:35:35.005 --> 02:35:37.472
carved stuff, but barely at all.

02:35:37.472 --> 02:35:39.716
LAURA: Right. I love her, I love her.

02:35:39.716 --> 02:35:41.667
SAM and LAURA: She's the best.

02:35:41.667 --> 02:35:43.447
SAM: Welcome to The Mighty Nein!

02:35:43.447 --> 02:35:45.704
LAURA: (cheers)

02:35:45.704 --> 02:35:48.452
MATT: (chirping) Walks right up to you, like
face-- (chirping)

02:35:53.732 --> 02:35:55.213
SAM: I just give her a kiss.

02:35:55.557 --> 02:35:57.377
MATT: (startled chirping)

02:35:57.656 --> 02:35:58.968
SAM: She's just so cute, you know?

02:35:58.968 --> 02:36:00.953
LAURA: I know, she really is.

02:36:00.953 --> 02:36:03.976
MATT: And goes back to helping Jester.

02:36:03.976 --> 02:36:05.592
TRAVIS: All right, to the cart, then.

02:36:05.592 --> 02:36:06.995
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:36:06.995 --> 02:36:09.764
LIAM: Do you know cats? Do you like cats? Do you
know cats?

02:36:09.764 --> 02:36:12.224
MARISHA: Birds don't like cats.

02:36:12.224 --> 02:36:13.507
LAURA: She's a baby bird.

02:36:13.507 --> 02:36:14.553
SAM: Cats don't like birds.

02:36:14.553 --> 02:36:16.790
MARISHA: Sorry, cats don't like birds.

02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:19.096
LIAM: Do you like cats?

02:36:19.096 --> 02:36:22.129
MATT: (chirping)

02:36:22.129 --> 02:36:29.750
LIAM: Into her hands. Frumpkin starts to purr and
nuzzle.

02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:33.654
MATT: She is spellbound by this moment of a cat
appearing in her hands.

02:36:33.654 --> 02:36:36.185
LIAM: Yeah, I ask Frumpkin to do a blep.

02:36:36.185 --> 02:36:38.475
LAURA: A blep.

02:36:38.475 --> 02:36:41.629
LIAM: And to lick her face.

02:36:41.629 --> 02:36:44.492
MATT: (chirping)

02:36:44.492 --> 02:36:49.042
MATT: Throws the cat down, seemingly weirded out
by the moment, doesn't quite know how to react.

02:36:49.042 --> 02:36:52.319
MARISHA: Frumpkin starts chittering.

02:36:52.319 --> 02:37:00.121
LIAM: He's friendly. That is my cat. If you want
to spend some time with him, you can. He is very

02:37:00.121 --> 02:37:06.041
soothing for me, anyway. Give it a shot.

02:37:06.041 --> 02:37:12.448
MATT: Picks up Frumpkin, and runs towards the cart
as you guys get there and load it up. Kiri jumps

02:37:12.448 --> 02:37:16.147
up into the cart and turns around to the rest of
you and goes, (like Nott) "Welcome to The Mighty

02:37:16.147 --> 02:37:21.344
Nein!" And starts petting Frumpkin.

02:37:21.344 --> 02:37:24.159
LAURA: I love her so much!

02:37:24.159 --> 02:37:27.858
SAM and TRAVIS: She's the best of us.

02:37:27.858 --> 02:37:30.686
TALIESIN: Well, this is never going to get
irritating. Let's get on our way.

02:37:30.686 --> 02:37:34.296
ASHLEY: Can I insight check her?

02:37:34.296 --> 02:37:38.300
MATT: Sure. Make an insight check.

02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:41.297
ASHLEY: My insight is so bad.

02:37:41.297 --> 02:37:44.272
TALIESIN: That's going to make it even better.

02:37:44.272 --> 02:37:46.122
ASHLEY: 12.

02:37:46.122 --> 02:37:57.258
MATT: It's a bird person. "I'm bird p--" Not that
kind of bird person, but--

02:37:57.258 --> 02:38:02.322
ASHLEY: I don't trust her. It's weird.

02:38:02.322 --> 02:38:06.483
LIAM: I just want to point out that, if we pick up
one more stray, there will actually be nine of us.

02:38:06.522 --> 02:38:08.706
TALIESIN: That can't happen. We will not have
that.

02:38:08.706 --> 02:38:10.369
ASHLEY: With Frumpkin--

02:38:10.369 --> 02:38:12.236
MARISHA: Then we wouldn't be ironic anymore.

02:38:12.236 --> 02:38:14.931
TALIESIN: Cling to our irony.

02:38:14.931 --> 02:38:16.034
LIAM: That's true.

02:38:16.034 --> 02:38:22.845
MARISHA: Are we cheeky or are we serious? That'll
totally change our entire disposition of the group.

02:38:22.845 --> 02:38:24.570
LIAM: It can be both.

02:38:24.570 --> 02:38:28.242
TALIESIN: Seriously cheeky? Cheekingly serious.

02:38:28.242 --> 02:38:31.475
LAURA: Let's put a cloak over her, so she looks a
little less like a bird.

02:38:31.475 --> 02:38:39.619
SAM: I've got some clothing that would fit her! My
clothing. I give you my cape and and stuff.

02:38:39.619 --> 02:38:40.918
MATT: (chirping)

02:38:40.918 --> 02:38:46.590
LAURA: But now you don't have a cloak on. I'll
take off my cloak and put it on Nott.

02:38:46.590 --> 02:38:47.777
SAM: I can't move.

02:38:47.777 --> 02:38:50.065
LAURA: But it's a short cloak, it's a little one,
don't worry.

02:38:50.065 --> 02:38:51.208
SAM: Okay, thank you.

02:38:51.208 --> 02:38:53.986
MATT: It's a nice flannel, I'm going to want it
back. Right now? Yeah.

02:38:53.986 --> 02:38:55.878
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

02:38:55.878 --> 02:38:58.019
LAURA: Okay, now I'm cold, too.

02:38:58.019 --> 02:39:02.797
LIAM: Caleb takes off his cloak and puts it on
Jester. I never wear a cloak when we're not in the city.

02:39:02.797 --> 02:39:06.681
LAURA: No, that's okay. I'm actually really warm
right now, I don't need anything.

02:39:06.681 --> 02:39:11.170
MARISHA: Yes, it's definitely like 85 degrees.
We're all sharing cloaks for no reason.

02:39:11.170 --> 02:39:13.246
LAURA: It's not 85 degrees, it's still cold here.

02:39:13.246 --> 02:39:14.621
MATT: It's pretty chilly. It's like mid-60s.

02:39:14.621 --> 02:39:16.751
LAURA: I put it back on Caleb and tuck him into
it.

02:39:16.751 --> 02:39:18.828
MARISHA: Sorry, it's a humid 60 degrees.

02:39:18.828 --> 02:39:23.832
MATT: It feels warmer than it is because of the
moisture in the air, but it's not, like, warm.

02:39:23.832 --> 02:39:28.359
LIAM: Look, you guys, we are trying to make it
work.

02:39:28.359 --> 02:39:29.924
TALIESIN: Let's head out.

02:39:29.924 --> 02:39:32.557
TRAVIS: Yeah, Molly and I take the lead on the horses.

02:39:32.557 --> 02:39:35.309
LAURA: Kiri, where was the city you saw, the
village of people?

02:39:35.309 --> 02:39:38.291
MATT: Points up in front of the road, in that
direction.

02:39:38.291 --> 02:39:39.554
LAURA: We should go in that direction.

02:39:39.554 --> 02:39:41.289
SAM: Wait, that's the way that we go to find
our--

02:39:41.289 --> 02:39:44.441
LAURA: So we can locate Febron Keyes, yeah.

02:39:44.441 --> 02:39:46.644
SAM: Okay, let's go.

02:39:46.817 --> 02:39:53.068
MATT: Following the Bromkiln Byway, your vision
pierces the dense tangle of trees and vines to see

02:39:53.068 --> 02:39:59.827
the distant glow of lanterns just as the sun sets
and the evening sky grows dark. Closer still, you

02:39:59.827 --> 02:40:05.964
make out a strange mismatch of varying levels that
make up the village. Whole areas stand on stilts

02:40:05.964 --> 02:40:12.960
and raised platforms connected by bridges, while
much of the city to the eastern side appears to be

02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:19.763
partly submerged in bog water. The browns, greens,
and grays of the marsh itself is reflected in the

02:40:19.763 --> 02:40:24.714
browns, greens, and grays of the people who now
wander the streets, going about their business.

02:40:24.714 --> 02:40:31.645
Welcome to Berleben, a somewhat miserable-looking,
but functional village here in the Dwendalian

02:40:31.645 --> 02:40:40.517
Empire. As you come off the road, the road gives
way into this central district, which looks to be

02:40:40.517 --> 02:40:46.929
a smattering of stone slabs, cobblestone, and
whatever pieces of material were left over from

02:40:46.929 --> 02:40:54.649
construction that helped fix and maintain a main
road here in the central opening before it

02:40:54.649 --> 02:40:57.728
scatters into the rest of the city. What would you
like to do?

02:40:57.728 --> 02:41:02.497
TALIESIN: Technically, did we get a short rest on
the way in? Or did that not happen?

02:41:02.497 --> 02:41:06.936
LIAM: Jester took most of the day to harvest a
gator.

02:41:06.936 --> 02:41:07.974
MATT: Yeah.

02:41:07.974 --> 02:41:13.796
LAURA: We should probably look for an inn or
something, right?

02:41:13.796 --> 02:41:20.111
MARISHA: We have to look for Febron who is
apparently in the Keystone Pub.

02:41:20.111 --> 02:41:23.870
LAURA: We should look for the Keystone Pub!

02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:26.540
LIAM: Febron Keyes in the Keystone Pub.

02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:30.430
MARISHA: In the (mumbling) district. I ran out of
page--

02:41:30.430 --> 02:41:31.695
LIAM: In the Puddles.

02:41:31.695 --> 02:41:35.117
MARISHA: In the Puddles! It is in the Puddles. I
got Pudd.

02:41:35.117 --> 02:41:36.744
LIAM: Puddin'.

02:41:36.744 --> 02:41:38.036
MATT: In the Puddin'.

02:41:38.036 --> 02:41:40.933
LAURA: Is there anybody outside right now?

02:41:40.933 --> 02:41:44.886
MATT: There are people walking through the
streets. Some of them are carrying small sacks

02:41:44.886 --> 02:41:49.662
over their shoulder from one place to another, or
in the process of wandering over to make about

02:41:49.662 --> 02:41:55.058
their business for the city, and they notice you
approach, and they're slightly nosey, paying

02:41:55.058 --> 02:41:57.060
attention to these strangers that came in off the
Byway.

02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:59.556
SAM: I'm going to cast Disguise Self on myself.

02:41:59.556 --> 02:42:01.249
MATT: Okay. To look like?

02:42:01.249 --> 02:42:03.017
SAM: A little halfling girl.

02:42:03.017 --> 02:42:05.626
MATT: All righty. (confused chirping)

02:42:05.626 --> 02:42:14.339
SAM: It's still me. I can change my body into
other things, woo!

02:42:14.339 --> 02:42:18.025
MATT: (chirping) She seems fascinated and
enthralled by this.

02:42:18.025 --> 02:42:25.828
SAM: Oh, here! Take my mask. Oh, but you have a
beak.

02:42:25.828 --> 02:42:29.049
MATT: (clicking) It's terrifying.

02:42:29.049 --> 02:42:34.926
LIAM: Just pull that cloak way down.

02:42:34.926 --> 02:42:40.471
MATT: There's still this long, dark beak poking
through, but you got what you got.

02:42:40.471 --> 02:42:42.003
MARISHA: It's stylistic. That's fine.

02:42:42.003 --> 02:42:43.376
LIAM: That's a Percy mask.

02:42:43.376 --> 02:42:45.576
MATT: Yeah. Plague Doctor it up.

02:42:45.576 --> 02:42:47.753
TRAVIS: Keystone Pub, right?

02:42:47.753 --> 02:42:48.979
LAURA: Yeah. Excuse me?

02:42:48.979 --> 02:42:54.159
MATT: There's one older woman going by, who's
hunched, has her own hood up, and a long gray

02:42:54.159 --> 02:42:59.710
cloak. She's wearing a stained linen blouse and
says, "What do you want?"

02:42:59.710 --> 02:43:01.868
LAURA: Lovely weather we're having, huh?

02:43:01.868 --> 02:43:03.594
MATT: "Weather's shit."

02:43:03.594 --> 02:43:10.761
LAURA: Okay! I was wondering if you could point us
towards an inn, or the Keystone Pub maybe?

02:43:10.761 --> 02:43:13.086
MATT: "Keystone Pub's in the Puddles, that way."

02:43:13.086 --> 02:43:14.558
LAURA: Thank you.

02:43:14.558 --> 02:43:16.461
MATT: "Look for the crooked tower thing."

02:43:16.461 --> 02:43:17.789
LAURA: Can you sleep there?

02:43:17.789 --> 02:43:21.686
MATT: "I mean, you can. I wouldn't be caught dead
there."

02:43:21.686 --> 02:43:22.701
LAURA: Oh.

02:43:22.701 --> 02:43:26.597
MARISHA: Here. Here's some pocket bacon for your
trouble.

02:43:26.597 --> 02:43:31.138
MATT: "What the fuck is pocket bacon?!"

02:43:31.138 --> 02:43:33.852
MARISHA: You seem like you'd appreciate that more
than money, so I don't know.

02:43:33.852 --> 02:43:39.331
MATT: "I'm very confused, but I'll take it." Puts
it in her pocket, keeps walking.

02:43:39.331 --> 02:43:40.334
MARISHA: See?

02:43:40.334 --> 02:43:41.933
SAM: How much of that do you have?

02:43:41.933 --> 02:43:43.532
MARISHA: I swiped from a few places.

02:43:43.532 --> 02:43:49.354
MATT: The whole campaign, she's been subtly,
stealthily stealing bacon.

02:43:49.354 --> 02:43:57.146
MARISHA: I would do that. I have done that. I just
want to say, wrap it up in a paper towel, stick it

02:43:57.146 --> 02:43:58.842
in your bag, fine.

02:43:58.842 --> 02:44:03.524
TRAVIS: From what we can see in the streets, is
anyone carrying any weapons, or guards, or spears?

02:44:03.524 --> 02:44:09.842
MATT: There are. You do actually see a handful of
crownsguard. They're present, it's still part of

02:44:09.842 --> 02:44:17.417
the Empire, though they look to be somewhat
lackluster. At least, their armor isn't as shiny

02:44:17.417 --> 02:44:24.160
and well-kept. It looks like one of them is like,
"Ah, fucking hell." They're stationed here, and

02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:29.717
they're probably not very appreciative, and have
tried their best to adapt to the life here in the

02:44:29.717 --> 02:44:36.187
Labenda Swamp, but they are visible throughout the
town, including The Puddles, which you begin to go

02:44:36.187 --> 02:44:44.552
towards. Almost half of the city takes up The
Puddles. It looks like it was the oldest portion

02:44:44.552 --> 02:44:53.835
of the town. The original Berleben was just this
district, called The Puddles. The entirety of it

02:44:53.835 --> 02:45:01.474
is beneath between one to three inches of water, so as you
begin to descend from the central area of the

02:45:01.474 --> 02:45:09.487
town, you begin to submerge your feet, and the
entire rest of the city has slowly been sinking

02:45:09.487 --> 02:45:21.396
into the swamp. It's like slowly wading through a
tide at the beach. It's also very much the

02:45:21.396 --> 02:45:25.958
impoverished side. If you could imagine an area of
the swamp more impoverished than what you've

02:45:25.958 --> 02:45:31.574
already come across, this is it. You see a lot of
huts and hovels. All the buildings here, on top of

02:45:31.574 --> 02:45:38.195
being older masonry and stone structures in
construct, the bases themselves are a deep algae

02:45:38.195 --> 02:45:44.747
green from the floor to about halfway up, about
two or three feet, where moss and fungus and

02:45:44.747 --> 02:45:49.686
various other plant matter have slowly grown as
the liquid that has been soaking into the vicinity

02:45:49.686 --> 02:45:57.100
is slowly growing up the sides of these buildings.
There's a fountain that has completely folded in

02:45:57.100 --> 02:46:02.180
now at this point. It has fallen into itself. Bits
of the water seem to have permeated through. It's

02:46:02.180 --> 02:46:03.912
an older relic of the earlier construction
period.

02:46:03.912 --> 02:46:05.600
LAURA: I cast Mending on the fountain.

02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:07.385
MATT: It does nothing.

02:46:07.385 --> 02:46:11.809
TALIESIN: I love this place. This is great.

02:46:11.809 --> 02:46:19.013
MATT: Crownsguard keep an eye on you as you are
the newcomers that walk in. You do notice, as you

02:46:19.013 --> 02:46:25.089
head down to the Puddles, that one of the guards
that watched you enter trails back about 30 or so

02:46:25.089 --> 02:46:27.099
feet, slowly walking and keeping an eye.

02:46:27.099 --> 02:46:30.582
MARISHA: I pace behind the group and start
catching up to him.

02:46:30.582 --> 02:46:31.947
LAURA: Is the wagon doing okay in the--

02:46:31.947 --> 02:46:37.226
MATT: Yeah, it's doing all right. It's only about
three inches of water averaged, so it's not a major

02:46:37.226 --> 02:46:41.468
hindrance. You're also going at a relatively
comfortable pace now that you're in the city.

02:46:41.468 --> 02:46:46.465
TRAVIS: Keep pushing in, looking for any signage
of the Keystone Pub.

02:46:46.465 --> 02:46:47.965
LAURA: Yeah, looking for the big tower thing.

02:46:47.965 --> 02:46:49.348
MATT: Perception check for both of you guys.

02:46:49.348 --> 02:46:53.269
LIAM: Also, very important question, how is Kiri
doing with Frumpkin?

02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:59.283
MATT: Kiri is now enthralled in the back of the
cart, hood up, Frumpkin curled up on her lap, and

02:46:59.283 --> 02:47:02.711
is slowly petting him. She's slowly petting him.

02:47:02.711 --> 02:47:08.845
MARISHA: I match pace with the crownsguard
eventually, the one that's following us.

02:47:08.845 --> 02:47:10.439
MATT: You come up and--

02:47:10.439 --> 02:47:13.819
MARISHA: I slow behind to match his pace, who's
following us.

02:47:13.819 --> 02:47:15.088
MATT: You two--

02:47:15.088 --> 02:47:16.029
TRAVIS: 15.

02:47:16.029 --> 02:47:17.233
LAURA: 22.

02:47:17.233 --> 02:47:21.779
MATT: You see it first, and as soon as you look in
that direction, you catch up with that, Fjord. You

02:47:21.779 --> 02:47:34.442
spot a small crooked tower, maybe about 25 or so
feet high. It looks like there was originally a

02:47:34.442 --> 02:47:41.840
building here that fell into itself and collapsed,
and they built a pub on top of it. Not very well,

02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:50.296
so it's a haphazard construct that looks somewhat
unstable with bits of broken stone and-- The only

02:47:50.296 --> 02:47:54.327
way you can get up into it are rope ladders
hanging down the front of it that lead into an

02:47:54.327 --> 02:47:58.770
archway that's open on the top. There are two oil
lanterns hanging from the outside that give this

02:47:58.770 --> 02:48:02.955
faint glow to the exterior. From the inside, it
looks warmly lit, though dark.

02:48:02.955 --> 02:48:04.910
MARISHA: I would hang out here all the time.

02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:09.531
MATT: It's about an eight-foot climb to get to the
threshold of the interior.

02:48:09.531 --> 02:48:13.892
LIAM: The only way to get in is an eight-foot
climb on a rope?

02:48:13.892 --> 02:48:14.914
MATT: That's what it looks like, yeah.

02:48:14.914 --> 02:48:16.086
LIAM: Oh dear.

02:48:16.086 --> 02:48:17.447
LAURA: Let's go up there!

02:48:17.447 --> 02:48:21.746
MATT: You guys guide your way that way. You manage
to catch up with the crownsguard who is walking.

02:48:21.746 --> 02:48:26.041
As soon as he sees you slowing behind, he lets you
catch up.

02:48:26.041 --> 02:48:32.646
LAURA: Should somebody stay with the cart, maybe?
Because I feel like all of our awesome stuff that

02:48:32.689 --> 02:48:34.176
we just got will be taken.

02:48:34.176 --> 02:48:35.140
SAM: What stuff?

02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:36.469
LAURA: This leather that we took--

02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:38.377
SAM: Bloody crocodile skins?

02:48:38.377 --> 02:48:42.675
TALIESIN: We have a beautiful piece of leather. We
also have some fine tapestries. We have a safe. We

02:48:42.675 --> 02:48:43.753
have many things.

02:48:43.753 --> 02:48:45.407
SAM: Well, Caleb can put his string around it.

02:48:45.407 --> 02:48:49.616
LIAM: I start to pull the silver thread around the
edges of the cart.

02:48:49.616 --> 02:48:52.424
SAM: (deep voice) Please step away from the
vehicle.

02:48:52.424 --> 02:48:57.052
MATT: You just leave it on the base of the tower?

02:48:57.052 --> 02:49:01.645
LIAM: All of us can get in, but anybody else will
set that off.

02:49:01.645 --> 02:49:07.046
MATT: As you approach, the guard turns to you.
"Evening, miss."

02:49:07.046 --> 02:49:09.446
MARISHA: Evening, sir.

02:49:09.446 --> 02:49:11.363
MATT: "Out of towners?"

02:49:11.363 --> 02:49:13.688
MARISHA: Passing through.

02:49:13.688 --> 02:49:18.376
MATT: "All right, just don't make any trouble."

02:49:18.376 --> 02:49:23.398
MARISHA: Feels like trouble would make your life a
little interesting, though, wouldn't it?

02:49:23.398 --> 02:49:24.949
MATT: "Don't like interesting."

02:49:24.949 --> 02:49:29.618
MARISHA: Oh, is that why you're stationed here? Is
this by choice, or who'd you piss off?

02:49:29.618 --> 02:49:33.157
MATT: "No trouble, miss."

02:49:33.157 --> 02:49:34.861
MARISHA: What's your name?

02:49:34.861 --> 02:49:39.793
MATT: He's staring right through you.

02:49:39.793 --> 02:49:50.782
MARISHA: No, nothing? Just a little conversation.
Just simple, you know, trying to be polite.

02:49:50.782 --> 02:49:53.357
MATT: "Your name first."

02:49:53.357 --> 02:49:55.500
MARISHA: Beau.

02:49:55.500 --> 02:49:56.505
MATT: "Beau."

02:49:56.505 --> 02:49:57.583
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:49:57.583 --> 02:49:59.025
MATT: "Crownsguard Alexander."

02:49:59.025 --> 02:50:03.318
MARISHA: Crownsguard Alexander. So formal.

02:50:03.318 --> 02:50:06.210
MATT: "I don't like you."

02:50:06.210 --> 02:50:08.915
MARISHA: I get that a lot.

02:50:08.915 --> 02:50:10.292
MATT: "I can imagine."

02:50:10.292 --> 02:50:11.360
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:12.535
MATT: "Don't start any trouble."

02:50:12.535 --> 02:50:13.239
MARISHA: All right.

02:50:13.239 --> 02:50:14.087
MATT: "Good. Get on your way."

02:50:14.087 --> 02:50:20.861
MARISHA: I will wait because I don't like him
telling me what to do and then I will get on my way.

02:50:20.861 --> 02:50:22.774
TRAVIS: When you're good and ready.

02:50:22.774 --> 02:50:29.716
MATT: As you wait there, this awkward 30 second
stare, he goes, "I'll just--"

02:50:29.716 --> 02:50:33.041
MARISHA: Yeah. No, I'm comfortable.

02:50:33.041 --> 02:50:39.219
TRAVIS: Let him know.

02:50:39.219 --> 02:50:42.512
MATT: "Be on your way." He turns around and walks
back to his post.

02:50:42.512 --> 02:50:49.579
MARISHA: I wait, and then I give myself a this for
winning that game of chicken. Yeah! Then I climb

02:50:49.579 --> 02:50:50.771
the rope.

02:50:50.771 --> 02:50:53.363
LIAM: Man, what a great scene between husband and
wife.

02:50:53.363 --> 02:50:59.595
TALIESIN: That was me at 16 with every cop ever;
that was great. This is the tiniest hill, and I

02:50:59.595 --> 02:51:02.890
will die on it. Never ended that well.

02:51:02.890 --> 02:51:05.000
MARISHA: This means nothing, and I want to win.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.075
MATT: Are you guys keeping Kiri in the cart?

02:51:09.075 --> 02:51:10.863
LIAM: No, she's coming with us.

02:51:10.863 --> 02:51:13.445
MATT: Kiri climbs up with you. (chirping)

02:51:13.445 --> 02:51:18.518
LAURA: Kiri, stay behind me a little bit, okay?
Don't make yourself obvious, all right?

02:51:18.518 --> 02:51:19.947
MATT: (like Jester) "All right."

02:51:19.947 --> 02:51:21.112
LAURA: We need to protect you.

02:51:21.112 --> 02:51:22.028
MATT: (like Jester) "Protect."

02:51:22.028 --> 02:51:25.012
SAM: We're bringing her into the bar?

02:51:25.012 --> 02:51:27.013
LAURA: We can't leave her in the cart!

02:51:27.013 --> 02:51:31.521
SAM: I guess not. Do you drink liquor, Kiri?

02:51:31.521 --> 02:51:33.557
MATT: (confused chirp)

02:51:33.557 --> 02:51:35.070
TALIESIN: No.

02:51:35.070 --> 02:51:36.684
SAM: Booze?

02:51:36.684 --> 02:51:38.627
LIAM, TALIESIN and LAURA: No!

02:51:38.627 --> 02:51:43.233
LAURA: Just say no. No! Kiri, no!

02:51:43.233 --> 02:51:44.582
SAM: Here, I'll give you--

02:51:44.582 --> 02:51:46.389
LAURA: No! Don't!

02:51:46.389 --> 02:51:48.716
LIAM: Do you know what booze is?

02:51:48.716 --> 02:51:50.321
MATT: (chirp)

02:51:50.321 --> 02:51:53.121
ASHLEY: She's going to try it sooner or later, you
know.

02:51:53.121 --> 02:51:57.625
LAURA: Do not let this little bird girl have
booze.

02:51:57.625 --> 02:52:00.047
LIAM: We'll get her a Tirley Shemple, it's fine.

02:52:00.047 --> 02:52:06.815
MARISHA: You know, if you teach respect early on
towards alcohol, though.

02:52:06.815 --> 02:52:08.159
SAM: That's true.

02:52:08.159 --> 02:52:10.216
MATT: (like Nott) "That's true!"

02:52:10.216 --> 02:52:12.371
ASHLEY: Because if she has it, she won't--

02:52:12.371 --> 02:52:16.022
SAM: That's a bad idea. Let's go in.

02:52:16.022 --> 02:52:29.462
MATT: She hands Frumpkin to you and climbs up the
rope with the rest of you. As you guys climb up the

02:52:29.462 --> 02:52:34.945
eight-foot jaunt up to the side, you step up past
the threshold into the archway and are immediately

02:52:34.945 --> 02:52:43.969
met with this tough-looking albino dwarf dude.
He's standing there with pale white skin, jet

02:52:43.969 --> 02:52:52.761
white-gray hair, white eyebrows, big white beard,
with this black leather vest that's tucked into

02:52:52.761 --> 02:53:00.152
billowing dark brown pants and boots. He's got all
these scars and tattoos across his forearms he's

02:53:00.152 --> 02:53:06.024
folded and he goes, "Right." Steps back, lets you
in.

02:53:06.024 --> 02:53:08.363
LAURA: Hi!

02:53:08.363 --> 02:53:18.170
MATT: Gives a nod. He continues to glare as you
guys step inside. Within, it's a warmly lit, cozy

02:53:18.170 --> 02:53:24.446
space that resembles being belowdeck on a ship at
sea. You're right at home here, Fjord. It's all

02:53:24.446 --> 02:53:31.150
dark wood from all different angles, and it's
cramped, too, so it has that similar feel. All the

02:53:31.150 --> 02:53:37.660
light in here are a handful of oil lanterns, so
it's pretty heavily shaded in certain areas, so

02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:41.881
you're only catching rim lighting and soft light
on certain faces around here. There's maybe six

02:53:41.881 --> 02:53:48.749
patrons in here total. To the right, this loud
banging sound as two individuals in the process of

02:53:48.749 --> 02:53:53.385
building some sort of a stage in the corner
immediately to your right. It's small, maybe

02:53:53.385 --> 02:53:59.305
five-foot by five-foot, but it's in the process of
being built. To your left, you see the bar. It's

02:53:59.305 --> 02:54:08.494
an L-shaped bar, not terribly large. There behind
it there's three oil lamps set up, they light the

02:54:08.494 --> 02:54:14.822
area. You can see some of the liquor bottles and
the ale kegs and everything set up towards the

02:54:14.822 --> 02:54:21.910
back of the bar. In the front, with one patron
sitting on a stool, you see a rather

02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:32.289
cheerful-looking, middle-aged male gnome as the
purveyor of this establishment. He's got puffy

02:54:32.289 --> 02:54:38.126
black hair and heavy mutton chops on the sides of
his face, this bulbous rosy nose. He's in the

02:54:38.126 --> 02:54:42.564
process of pouring and refilling this tankard for
the patron who's leaning against the bar in front

02:54:42.564 --> 02:54:47.573
of him, this gruff-looking fisherman human dude.
He gives a glance over to you as you step in,

02:54:47.573 --> 02:54:55.671
taking in the vicinity, and goes, "Hey! Welcome to
the Keystone Pub! Oldest pub in the Labenda! The

02:54:55.671 --> 02:55:02.807
"oldest pub in the Labenda is beneath this one, but
we rebuilt it."

02:55:02.807 --> 02:55:04.282
LAURA: It's really cool.

02:55:04.282 --> 02:55:05.308
TALIESIN: Stunning.

02:55:05.308 --> 02:55:07.814
MATT: "Thank you very much. Glad you could make
it. Where are you all from?"

02:55:07.814 --> 02:55:12.040
LIAM: All over the place, really.

02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:13.450
SAM: Alfield.

02:55:13.450 --> 02:55:19.004
MATT: "Alfield, that's a bit of a journey, isn't
it? Well, glad you could make it. Not many folks

02:55:19.004 --> 02:55:20.655
"come that far over here to visit the swamp."

02:55:20.655 --> 02:55:23.326
MARISHA: What's your name, good sir?

02:55:23.326 --> 02:55:25.586
MATT: "I am Dent Bonswallow."

02:55:25.586 --> 02:55:29.858
LAURA: He's a little bit high right now.

02:55:29.858 --> 02:55:31.478
LIAM: Bon or Barn, or--?

02:55:31.478 --> 02:55:34.972
MATT: "Dent Bonswallow."

02:55:34.972 --> 02:55:41.119
LAURA: Can I look around at the few patrons that
are in here and see if any of them fit the

02:55:41.119 --> 02:55:42.926
description of Febron Keyes?

02:55:42.926 --> 02:55:44.418
MATT: Perception check.

02:55:44.418 --> 02:55:46.626
TRAVIS: Two teeth, busted eye.

02:55:46.626 --> 02:55:48.572
MARISHA: Looks super cray.

02:55:48.572 --> 02:55:52.222
LAURA: That was a shitty roll. Eight.

02:55:52.222 --> 02:55:56.629
MATT: It's too dark in here, unfortunately.
There's only six other patrons, but they're too

02:55:56.629 --> 02:55:58.754
dimly lit for you to make out any features.

02:55:58.754 --> 02:56:03.440
LAURA: Can I get up close to them and one by one?

02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:05.436
SAM: We can look in a few more minutes.

02:56:05.436 --> 02:56:08.384
LIAM: Let your eyes adjust to the room.

02:56:08.384 --> 02:56:12.902
MATT: As Jester begins walking off through the
chamber, he's like, "What can I get you guys? What

02:56:12.902 --> 02:56:14.224
"you asking for? What you looking for?"

02:56:14.224 --> 02:56:15.586
MARISHA: What's your strongest drink?

02:56:15.586 --> 02:56:18.940
MATT: "That would be the Labenda Throat Grog."

02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:21.684
MARISHA: What is-- what?

02:56:21.684 --> 02:56:23.270
MATT: "Labenda Throat Grog."

02:56:23.270 --> 02:56:25.055
MARISHA: Yeah. That.

02:56:25.055 --> 02:56:27.177
MATT: "Burns you like a fucker."

02:56:27.177 --> 02:56:29.789
MARISHA: Bender Throat Grog?

02:56:29.789 --> 02:56:35.338
MATT: "Labenda. The swamp you're in. Same color as
the swamp. Burns your throat. Tastes like grog.

02:56:35.338 --> 02:56:36.513
"That's where it got its name."

02:56:36.513 --> 02:56:39.190
MARISHA: What do you mean, same color as the
swamp? Green and shitty?

02:56:39.190 --> 02:56:40.270
MATT: "Yeah!"

02:56:40.270 --> 02:56:43.169
TALIESIN: That sounds exciting. I think we need a
round.

02:56:43.169 --> 02:56:47.269
MATT: "A round for everyone? You too?" Points to
the little hooded creature next to you.

02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:50.199
SAM: No, she's on the wagon.

02:56:50.199 --> 02:56:55.180
MATT: (as Kiri, like Nott) "On the wagon." (as
Dent) "Right. Weird."

02:56:55.180 --> 02:56:59.066
(laughter)

02:56:59.066 --> 02:57:00.738
TALIESIN: I didn't know I needed this.

02:57:00.738 --> 02:57:06.288
MATT: "That's going to put you back about 25
copper pieces."

02:57:06.288 --> 02:57:11.067
MARISHA: Oh. I'll take it. No, I've got it.

02:57:11.067 --> 02:57:11.992
LIAM: I have it.

02:57:11.992 --> 02:57:12.976
MARISHA: This one's on me.

02:57:12.976 --> 02:57:13.954
LIAM: That's easy for me to do.

02:57:13.954 --> 02:57:15.046
MARISHA: I need it for tax write-offs.

02:57:15.046 --> 02:57:16.497
TRAVIS: Boulder-parchment-shears!

02:57:16.497 --> 02:57:18.133
SAM: They always fight for the check.

02:57:18.133 --> 02:57:19.383
MARISHA: Boulder-parchment-shears.

02:57:19.383 --> 02:57:20.648
LIAM: Okay.

02:57:20.648 --> 02:57:24.322
LIAM: Eins, zwei, drei. Snip.

02:57:24.322 --> 02:57:25.237
MARISHA: All right, you get it.

02:57:25.237 --> 02:57:29.298
MATT: As he's pouring the drinks one by one: "What
brings you to town? What brings you so far north

02:57:29.298 --> 02:57:30.670
"from Alfield?"

02:57:30.670 --> 02:57:36.127
LAURA: We heard amazing things about this area,
and we thought we would check it out, because

02:57:36.127 --> 02:57:38.139
we're travelers.

02:57:38.139 --> 02:57:40.452
MARISHA: Historical point of interest.

02:57:40.452 --> 02:57:45.882
LAURA: Yes, and we like to see different sorts of
things, and this is really an interesting area.

02:57:45.882 --> 02:57:48.815
You know, not many cities have a lot of water in
them like this.

02:57:48.815 --> 02:57:52.173
MATT: "It's a shithole. But it's our shithole!"

02:57:52.173 --> 02:57:54.946
LAURA: It's really cool-looking, though.

02:57:54.946 --> 02:57:56.432
MATT: "Thank you, I appreciate that."

02:57:56.432 --> 02:57:59.139
MARISHA: That's exactly the magnet that I bought
when I got in here.

02:57:59.139 --> 02:58:00.958
MATT: "Oh, you got one of the shithole magnets,
too?"

02:58:00.958 --> 02:58:02.053
MARISHA: I got a shithole magnet.

02:58:02.053 --> 02:58:04.388
MATT: "If anyone else wants any, I got a whole
bucket of them."

02:58:04.388 --> 02:58:07.768
TALIESIN: You are a shithole magnet, really, when
you think about it. That's fair.

02:58:07.768 --> 02:58:08.976
MARISHA: It spoke to me.

02:58:08.976 --> 02:58:13.946
SAM: You're building a stage for something? Is
there some sort of circus in town?

02:58:13.946 --> 02:58:18.555
MATT: "No, I wanted some entertainment to liven
the place up a bit. I've been here for ten years,

02:58:18.555 --> 02:58:20.807
"and it's been a bit dull."

02:58:20.807 --> 02:58:23.801
TRAVIS: Did you own the previous bar that this
one's built on top of?

02:58:23.801 --> 02:58:28.557
MATT: "I did. Inherited it from my father, before
it, you know."

02:58:28.557 --> 02:58:33.675
LIAM: How old is Berleben in general?

02:58:33.675 --> 02:58:36.090
MATT: "It's been here since the empire started.
Almost three centuries."

02:58:36.090 --> 02:58:37.770
LIAM: Wow.

02:58:37.770 --> 02:58:38.961
MATT: "Yeah."

02:58:38.961 --> 02:58:42.066
TRAVIS: You know, we love traveling around. Is
there anything in Berleben that we just have to

02:58:42.066 --> 02:58:43.778
see before we leave?

02:58:43.778 --> 02:58:45.928
MATT: "I mean, you're there."

02:58:45.928 --> 02:58:47.441
TRAVIS: Here?

02:58:47.441 --> 02:58:50.195
MATT: "Yeah. It's the finest pub in town."

02:58:50.195 --> 02:58:51.153
TRAVIS: Great.

02:58:51.153 --> 02:58:55.054
MATT: "Hey, it's rough to start at the top, mate,
but you make your way down."

02:58:55.054 --> 02:58:56.552
TRAVIS: Worse ways to go.

02:58:56.552 --> 02:59:00.928
TALIESIN: Can we go shopping in town, maybe? We've
got some leather to trade, may have some armor.

02:59:00.928 --> 02:59:07.773
MATT: "Maybe. Your best bet for trade wouldn't be
here in The Puddles. You'd be looking for the

02:59:07.773 --> 02:59:14.700
"Midway Docks. That's where most of the business
gets done here. If you're looking for things for a

02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:23.009
"fancier space, maybe you want to head to The
Stilts, but that's where the-- what's the word I'm

02:59:23.009 --> 02:59:28.773
"looking for-- folks who run the place stay."

02:59:28.773 --> 02:59:30.822
LIAM: There's a fancier part of this town?

02:59:30.822 --> 02:59:35.450
MATT: "It's The Stilts. It's where it's all raised
up. That's where the Summit House is, where the

02:59:35.450 --> 02:59:39.634
"Starosta stays. There's the Mossmire Temple, which
is where the druid that keeps the swamp fane

02:59:39.634 --> 02:59:45.400
"stays. The Idolmaster."

02:59:45.456 --> 02:59:48.436
TALIESIN: We're also going to be looking for a
place to sleep. I don't know if you'd recommend

02:59:48.436 --> 02:59:49.549
anywhere that--

02:59:49.549 --> 02:59:50.690
MATT: "You're already here."

02:59:50.690 --> 02:59:51.634
TALIESIN: You have rooms?

02:59:51.634 --> 02:59:52.913
MATT: "Yeah!" He points down.

02:59:52.913 --> 02:59:54.353
TALIESIN: That's exciting!

02:59:54.353 --> 02:59:55.316
LAURA: Downstairs?

02:59:55.316 --> 02:59:56.156
MATT: "Yeah!"

02:59:56.156 --> 02:59:57.847
LAURA: Whoa, that could be so much fun!

02:59:57.847 --> 02:59:59.224
MARISHA: Is it haunted?

02:59:59.224 --> 03:00:02.657
MATT: "Do you like things that are haunted?"

03:00:02.657 --> 03:00:03.637
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yes.

03:00:03.637 --> 03:00:04.573
MATT: "It's haunted!"

03:00:04.573 --> 03:00:05.771
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:00:05.771 --> 03:00:06.784
LAURA: Is it submerged in water?

03:00:06.784 --> 03:00:11.056
MATT: "No, we cleared out underneath. Everything
that fell in, we cleared out, and we have

03:00:11.056 --> 03:00:12.708
"subterranean rooms."

03:00:12.708 --> 03:00:15.119
TALIESIN: I'm very excited by this.

03:00:15.119 --> 03:00:18.949
ASHLEY: Do they have portholes to the water?

03:00:18.949 --> 03:00:24.518
MATT: "That's not a bad idea." He makes a note on
a piece of paper. "There will be, in a few weeks."

03:00:24.518 --> 03:00:25.657
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:00:25.657 --> 03:00:27.088
LIAM: Are they below the water level here?

03:00:27.088 --> 03:00:30.360
MATT: "Most of them, no. But there's a few if you
like it wee bit soggy."

03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:33.359
TRAVIS: I walk away from the bar and stand near
the door entrance.

03:00:33.359 --> 03:00:36.055
MARISHA: I cover for Fjord a little bit. Just
taking space.

03:00:36.055 --> 03:00:37.240
MATT: Okay.

03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:41.470
MARISHA: Just fill it out. This is my bubble now.

03:00:41.470 --> 03:00:43.693
MATT: Nobody get close!

03:00:43.693 --> 03:00:45.403
TALIESIN: How many rooms do you have?

03:00:45.403 --> 03:00:47.317
MATT: "Four."

03:00:47.317 --> 03:00:49.756
TALIESIN: How much are they apiece?

03:00:49.756 --> 03:00:55.404
MATT: "Let's see, for the inn put it about a
silver piece per room."

03:00:55.404 --> 03:00:58.427
TALIESIN: I figure we should stay in all four for a
couple of days.

03:00:58.530 --> 03:00:59.655
MATT: "Per person."

03:00:59.655 --> 03:01:00.956
TALIESIN: Per person?

03:01:00.956 --> 03:01:01.954
MATT: "Yes."

03:01:01.954 --> 03:01:06.069
LAURA: That's a lot more than you originally made
it sound like.

03:01:06.069 --> 03:01:08.379
MATT: "I apologize for the miscommunication."

03:01:08.379 --> 03:01:11.636
TALIESIN: I am perfectly okay with this.

03:01:11.636 --> 03:01:12.590
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:01:12.590 --> 03:01:13.685
LAURA: Yeah, sure, why not?

03:01:13.685 --> 03:01:14.805
MARISHA: It is haunted.

03:01:14.805 --> 03:01:18.652
MATT: "That is the case. You pay for them
spirits."

03:01:18.652 --> 03:01:23.032
LAURA: Is there someone who can keep our cart? Do
you have a place we can keep our cart?

03:01:23.032 --> 03:01:24.362
MATT: "You brought a cart?"

03:01:24.362 --> 03:01:25.733
LAURA: Well, yeah.

03:01:25.733 --> 03:01:28.619
MATT: "Then yeah. We can keep it. I can keep it."

03:01:28.685 --> 03:01:32.870
LAURA: Keep it where? Where?

03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:36.410
MATT: (defeated) "You can take it to the
stables."

03:01:36.410 --> 03:01:37.793
LAURA: Okay.

03:01:37.793 --> 03:01:45.665
MATT: "The Midway Docks. But I can do it for you!
For just a few copper. A delivery fee."

03:01:45.665 --> 03:01:48.780
LAURA: No, I'll do it because I want to see the
town.

03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:49.744
MATT: "Okay."

03:01:49.744 --> 03:01:50.842
TALIESIN: Eight silver.

03:01:50.842 --> 03:01:53.135
SAM: You said a silver per person?

03:01:53.135 --> 03:01:54.096
MATT: "Aye."

03:01:54.096 --> 03:01:58.968
TALIESIN: Let's put a couple-- yeah, eight, that's
fine, I've got that.

03:01:58.968 --> 03:01:59.927
LAURA: Sure.

03:01:59.927 --> 03:02:06.266
MATT: "Fair enough. Deed is done. Thank you! Did
you want me to be delivering your cart for you?"

03:02:06.266 --> 03:02:09.003
LAURA: No, I can do it. Yeah.

03:02:09.003 --> 03:02:10.197
SAM: We'll be fine.

03:02:10.197 --> 03:02:13.326
MATT: "All right. If you ever get lazy-- "

03:02:13.326 --> 03:02:15.486
LAURA: Where's the stable?

03:02:15.486 --> 03:02:21.207
MATT: "The Midway. There's only really one stable.
It's a bit large, there. It's in the Midway Docks,

03:02:21.207 --> 03:02:23.064
"so keep an eye out, ask around, you'll find it."

03:02:23.064 --> 03:02:26.854
MARISHA: Bonswallow.

03:02:26.854 --> 03:02:27.914
MATT: "Yeah?"

03:02:27.914 --> 03:02:37.754
MARISHA: We heard about a kooky regular. We just
have to meet him. Febron?

03:02:37.754 --> 03:02:40.195
MATT: "You looking for old Febron?"

03:02:40.195 --> 03:02:41.675
MARISHA: Febron Keyes, yeah.

03:02:41.675 --> 03:02:49.497
MATT: "I ain't going to ask. He's over there. Left
of the stage where it looks like he's passed out,

03:02:49.497 --> 03:02:54.481
"probably in his own piss, most likely." He points
in the direction, you can see where they're

03:02:54.481 --> 03:03:01.236
banging with hammers at the stage, there's one guy
who's like (snoring). Just completely out.

03:03:01.236 --> 03:03:03.643
Probably drooling down the side of the face.

03:03:03.643 --> 03:03:06.490
LAURA: Man! I was going to look at everyone in
here!

03:03:06.490 --> 03:03:08.181
SAM: We found him! We won!

03:03:08.181 --> 03:03:09.409
LAURA: He's right here!

03:03:09.409 --> 03:03:12.541
SAM: We send the message back to The Gentleman,
and we'll collect our money.

03:03:12.541 --> 03:03:14.794
TALIESIN: Were we given anything special to say to
him or should we go wake him up?

03:03:14.794 --> 03:03:17.380
LAURA: No, we have to secure the safe house.

03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:20.567
SAM: Oh, that's right, that's not-- okay, I'm
sorry, I was confused.

03:03:20.567 --> 03:03:22.632
MATT: He's just the contact who knows.

03:03:22.632 --> 03:03:25.236
LAURA: Let's go wake him up!

03:03:25.236 --> 03:03:28.623
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to walk over and sit
down at his table.

03:03:28.623 --> 03:03:31.661
MATT: (snoring)

03:03:31.661 --> 03:03:36.619
TALIESIN: Wave my drink underneath his nose. Hey
hey hey! I pop it off.

03:03:36.619 --> 03:03:38.748
MATT: (snoring)

03:03:38.748 --> 03:03:40.533
TALIESIN: I'll flick him in the forehead.

03:03:40.533 --> 03:03:46.709
MATT: (groans) "What the fuck you do that for?"

03:03:46.709 --> 03:03:48.101
SAM: Oh, boy.

03:03:48.101 --> 03:03:49.836
TALIESIN: You seem like such a charming
gentleman.

03:03:49.836 --> 03:03:58.860
MATT: You now have the full appearance here, and
it's pretty busted. The Gentleman was wrong. There

03:03:58.860 --> 03:04:02.622
is one tooth, but it is black and angled.

03:04:02.622 --> 03:04:04.530
LIAM: From the bottom?

03:04:04.530 --> 03:04:09.855
MATT: Yeah, from the bottom out. The lips are
cracked. The left eye is angling off in an off

03:04:09.855 --> 03:04:13.939
direction. He looks like he's probably been kicked
in the face a few times by probably a horse at

03:04:13.939 --> 03:04:21.187
some point in his childhood. He's definitely had a
rough go at life, probably, but has seemed to have

03:04:21.187 --> 03:04:31.062
carved a living. The very balding head on top,
jaundiced skin, looks like he's sweating from the

03:04:31.062 --> 03:04:36.478
general humidity of the air in there, along with
probably who knows how much he's been drinking and

03:04:36.478 --> 03:04:43.482
he's sweating the alcohol through his pores.
Doesn't take care of himself. He looks up. "So

03:04:43.482 --> 03:04:46.256
"what you doing?"

03:04:46.256 --> 03:04:49.521
TALIESIN: You just seem like such a charming
gentleman.

03:04:49.521 --> 03:04:51.096
MATT: "Why the fuck did you flick me?"

03:04:51.096 --> 03:04:53.081
TALIESIN: We were sent for.

03:04:53.081 --> 03:04:58.000
MATT: "From-- ? Where's my fucking drink?"

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.549
TALIESIN: A certain gentleman.

03:05:00.549 --> 03:05:06.508
MATT: Tension goes straight. This eye goes
(fwoop!). Joins the other.

03:05:06.508 --> 03:05:08.187
TALIESIN: I hand him the drink one more time.

03:05:08.187 --> 03:05:15.272
MATT: "You were sent by The Gentleman? Yeah?
What's he want?"

03:05:15.272 --> 03:05:20.755
MARISHA: Don't drink from that again. Don't. Wash
that.

03:05:20.755 --> 03:05:22.631
TALIESIN: It's sterile. By its very nature it's
sterile.

03:05:22.631 --> 03:05:25.192
SAM: Can you use Mending on him?

03:05:25.192 --> 03:05:28.805
LAURA: Just on his teeth.

03:05:28.805 --> 03:05:30.373
TALIESIN: Don't fix him, he's perfect!

03:05:30.373 --> 03:05:33.483
LIAM: That would be a 9th-level spell, that's
beyond--

03:05:33.483 --> 03:05:35.477
MARISHA: That's a Wish! Yeah!

03:05:35.477 --> 03:05:40.438
TALIESIN: We're here to help you with your
troubles.

03:05:40.438 --> 03:05:46.789
MATT: (chuckles) "My troubles just started, mate!
Don't want anything with this. No. Fucking out.

03:05:46.789 --> 03:05:48.287
"No. Want nothing to do with it!"

03:05:48.287 --> 03:05:50.000
TALIESIN: We're here to deal with the safe house.

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:53.869
MATT: "Nope. Think I'm fucking doing it? It's not
my problem anymore! I don't want anything to do

03:05:53.869 --> 03:05:58.838
"with him, or any of his business. He wants to send
more of his toadies out to a drowning death? Go

03:05:58.838 --> 03:06:03.086
"for it! That's up to you. I want nothing to do
with it. You can do it without adding corpses by

03:06:03.086 --> 03:06:04.241
"my tangle."

03:06:04.241 --> 03:06:06.711
TALIESIN: Well, if you want another drink, then,
you're going to show us how to get there and how

03:06:06.711 --> 03:06:08.104
to deal with it and what you know.

03:06:08.104 --> 03:06:10.754
MATT: "How is that? It's a drink for it? Eh, fuck
you!"

03:06:10.754 --> 03:06:13.558
TALIESIN: (laughs) I take my drink back.

03:06:13.558 --> 03:06:18.530
LIAM: We could also drag you back to The Gentleman
if you'd prefer that, instead. Or you could point

03:06:18.530 --> 03:06:20.940
us in the right direction and let us take care of
it.

03:06:20.940 --> 03:06:23.398
TRAVIS: True. He did not have the kindest things
to say about you.

03:06:23.398 --> 03:06:24.840
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:28.585
MARISHA: Beau gives a crack.

03:06:28.585 --> 03:06:37.005
LAURA: You're so intimidating, Caleb. Really,
really--

03:06:37.005 --> 03:06:39.619
LIAM: That is a 15.

03:06:39.619 --> 03:06:45.579
MATT: A 15? The sweat begins to build a little
more on his brow. He's like, "Well, I was just--

03:06:45.579 --> 03:06:54.208
"don't need to be taking me back to him. You know,
I don't want the work anymore."

03:06:54.208 --> 03:06:57.822
LIAM: Well, you know: keep it simple, stupid.

03:06:57.822 --> 03:07:08.787
MATT: (sighs) "Could I get another drink? Look
mate, it's some shit going on out there in the

03:07:08.787 --> 03:07:12.490
"swamp. I bet he didn't tell you anything, did
he?"

03:07:12.490 --> 03:07:13.776
LAURA: Was it gators?

03:07:13.776 --> 03:07:15.841
MATT: "No, it wasn't gators!"

03:07:15.841 --> 03:07:18.087
LAURA: Oh well, because we are really good at
killing those.

03:07:18.087 --> 03:07:24.433
LIAM: We are very aware that he has sent us into
something more troublesome than he has described,

03:07:24.433 --> 03:07:31.139
and we are willing to do that. We're told you are
the one who can get us in the right direction?

03:07:31.139 --> 03:07:36.920
We'll be very disappointed otherwise.

03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:42.985
MATT: "Look. It was easy work, mate. All right?
Meet his friends, lead them to the safe house in

03:07:42.985 --> 03:07:53.047
"the swamp, lead them back. Good pay. Simple work.
And yeah, I'm going to miss it, huh? But I value

03:07:53.047 --> 03:08:00.930
"my life more than that. Few weeks back I escorted
one of his smuggled troops to the safe house in

03:08:00.930 --> 03:08:08.547
"the swamp. Right? The one you're asking about.
Left them there with instruction to return a few

03:08:08.547 --> 03:08:16.749
"days later and escort them to the underground
river. Returned and I heard something cruel. Some

03:08:16.749 --> 03:08:29.876
"low, echoing howl. (weak scream) It was much
scarier than that. Shaking, I got there, right?

03:08:29.876 --> 03:08:43.505
"Fucking hell. Outside the house, all of them,
dead. Strung up in reeds and roots. Bloated and

03:08:43.505 --> 03:08:49.936
"left as a warning, that's what I say. I hear the
howl again, and I just run."

03:08:49.936 --> 03:08:52.389
SAM: I'm covering Kiri's ears.

03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:59.724
MATT: "There be curses in this swamp. Have been
since before this loathsome struggle shithole's

03:08:59.724 --> 03:09:06.709
"been here. (tearfully) Nightmares I been having,
yeah? Been having ever since. Whatever it is, it's

03:09:06.709 --> 03:09:16.088
"gotten in me head! I ain't going. It ain't worth
it if I had the coin!"

03:09:16.099 --> 03:09:17.883
LAURA: What if we paid you 100 coin?

03:09:17.883 --> 03:09:19.065
MATT: "I'll come for that."

03:09:19.065 --> 03:09:28.590
(laughter)

03:09:28.673 --> 03:09:31.188
LAURA: All right. We could do that.

03:09:31.249 --> 03:09:32.619
ASHLEY: You just said "coin," right?

03:09:32.619 --> 03:09:35.903
LAURA: I just said "coin." I didn't make it clear
which kind of coin.

03:09:35.903 --> 03:09:37.517
SAM: Copper? 100 copper?

03:09:37.517 --> 03:09:43.619
LAURA: 100 copper? 100 silver, okay, 100 silver,
you got it.

03:09:43.619 --> 03:09:51.325
MARISHA: Half and half. Little gold, little
silver. Silver and gold.

03:09:51.325 --> 03:09:53.164
ASHLEY: Which make--?

03:09:53.164 --> 03:09:55.826
MATT: Make it a hundred gold pieces and buy me a
drink.

03:09:55.826 --> 03:10:01.636
SAM: Yeah, I'll pour you a drink. I'll refill his
cup. Does he have a cup?

03:10:01.636 --> 03:10:06.357
MATT: He does. He had to pull it off the ground.
It's knocked over and spilled.

03:10:06.357 --> 03:10:08.650
SAM: With my flask, I'll fill it up.

03:10:08.650 --> 03:10:10.162
LAURA: That's one part of it taken care of!

03:10:10.162 --> 03:10:12.159
MATT: "And the other?"

03:10:12.159 --> 03:10:13.566
LAURA: All right.

03:10:13.566 --> 03:10:15.081
SAM: Half now, half upon--

03:10:15.081 --> 03:10:17.750
LAURA: Upon delivery to the place.

03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:20.170
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:10:20.170 --> 03:10:24.494
LIAM: That's a persuasive Jessie--

03:10:24.494 --> 03:10:25.770
LAURA: No, it's not, it's really not.

03:10:25.770 --> 03:10:26.902
LIAM: Damn it, Jessie!

03:10:26.902 --> 03:10:27.913
LAURA: It's a nine!

03:10:27.913 --> 03:10:33.328
MATT: "100 gold now, or you're pissing up the wind
to find this little place!"

03:10:33.328 --> 03:10:39.669
LAURA: Don't be a dick to us. You already said you
were scared of us bringing you back to The

03:10:39.669 --> 03:10:41.580
Gentleman. What are you going to do?

03:10:41.580 --> 03:10:44.781
MATT: (Kiri, like Jester) "What are you going to
do?" Your bird friend says. He goes--

03:10:44.781 --> 03:10:46.979
MARISHA: Yeah, what she said.

03:10:46.979 --> 03:10:53.256
MATT: (as Febron) "Look. I'm going to be risking
my life, I'm going to do it for the right amount

03:10:53.256 --> 03:11:00.717
"of coin, okay? It's a service I'm providing. You
can drag me back if you like. It's a pain in the ass!"

03:11:00.717 --> 03:11:09.424
MARISHA: Look, you got to risk your life for the
coin, or we can drag you back, as you said,

03:11:09.424 --> 03:11:10.970
without any coin.

03:11:10.970 --> 03:11:16.140
MATT: "Then drag me back! Take me back to him!
Empty-handed in the deal you're looking for!"

03:11:16.140 --> 03:11:17.706
SAM: 100 gold.

03:11:17.706 --> 03:11:21.771
LAURA: And you sing us a song. On the stage.

03:11:21.771 --> 03:11:26.000
MATT: "100 gold."

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:31.395
LAURA: And?

03:11:31.395 --> 03:11:34.840
MATT: Make another persuasion check. With
disadvantage.

03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:36.733
LIAM: Because Matt doesn't want to sing.

03:11:36.733 --> 03:11:38.244
MATT: No, he doesn't want to sing!

03:11:38.244 --> 03:11:40.834
LAURA: 12?

03:11:40.834 --> 03:11:44.625
MATT: He goes, "Deal, but it's a short song!"

03:11:44.625 --> 03:11:50.396
LAURA: Yeah! Does everyone want to chip in a
little bit of gold?

03:11:50.396 --> 03:11:51.779
SAM: Sure.

03:11:51.779 --> 03:11:53.517
TALIESIN: I want to point out, this is entirely
your doing.

03:11:53.517 --> 03:11:57.066
LIAM: I'm going to give you all my gold. That is
one.

03:11:57.066 --> 03:12:00.064
SAM: I'll take Caleb's share.

03:12:00.064 --> 03:12:02.091
MARISHA: Man, you are so broke all the damn time!

03:12:02.091 --> 03:12:03.947
LIAM: No, I have two silver and five copper!

03:12:03.947 --> 03:12:05.715
MARISHA: You are so broke all the damn time!

03:12:05.715 --> 03:12:07.716
LIAM: How. Broke. Am I?

03:12:07.716 --> 03:12:11.534
LAURA: This is like sorting out a check at the end
of a meal.

03:12:11.534 --> 03:12:12.909
TRAVIS: I'll give you 20.

03:12:12.909 --> 03:12:13.943
TALIESIN: I'll give you 12.

03:12:13.943 --> 03:12:15.727
MARISHA: I'll give you 20. I'll cover Caleb.

03:12:15.727 --> 03:12:16.733
SAM: 12?

03:12:16.733 --> 03:12:22.282
LAURA: 20 plus 20, 12, okay.

03:12:22.282 --> 03:12:24.948
SAM: I'll take the rest.

03:12:24.948 --> 03:12:26.875
MATT: Accounting in D&amp;amp;D!

03:12:26.875 --> 03:12:34.018
LAURA: No, I'm going to do 20 from me, too, so
that's 72, and then one from Caleb, so 73, so--

03:12:34.018 --> 03:12:35.224
SAM: 27 from me.

03:12:35.224 --> 03:12:36.150
LAURA: All right.

03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:38.618
ASHLEY: Wait, but I didn't put any. I'll put in
ten, and you put in--

03:12:38.618 --> 03:12:39.798
SAM: 17.

03:12:39.798 --> 03:12:47.234
LAURA: All right. Here's your gold. All of us
pulled together. Now go sing your song! Wait,

03:12:47.234 --> 03:12:48.792
shake my hand because-- eww.

03:12:48.792 --> 03:12:49.999
TALIESIN: You said it.

03:12:49.999 --> 03:12:54.365
LAURA: It's really important to shake when you
make a deal. And look me in the eye.

03:12:54.365 --> 03:12:56.999
MATT: His one eye wandering.

03:12:56.999 --> 03:12:59.339
ASHLEY: Both of them.

03:12:59.339 --> 03:13:03.250
LIAM: (whispers) Power ballad!

03:13:03.250 --> 03:13:10.914
MARISHA: Make it a good one. One we all know the
words to. I want to sing along! I yell at him as

03:13:10.914 --> 03:13:12.204
he walks away.

03:13:12.204 --> 03:13:13.201
SAM: You're the worst.

03:13:13.201 --> 03:13:20.683
MATT: He slinks over. The stage is only partially
up, and the two guys go-- "Just a moment." They're

03:13:20.683 --> 03:13:29.242
like, "Fuck off!" "Just a fucking moment! Just
one!" They're like, "Fucking hell, Febron,

03:13:29.242 --> 03:13:35.887
"seriously?" They step back, cross their arms and
he gets up on the stage.

03:13:35.887 --> 03:13:38.857
LAURA: Margaritaville!

03:13:38.857 --> 03:13:41.249
MATT: Looks at the pouch of coins.

03:13:41.249 --> 03:13:43.128
MARISHA: Free Bird!

03:13:43.128 --> 03:13:46.883
ASHLEY: Stairway to Heaven!

03:13:52.654 --> 03:14:01.742
MATT: (singing off-key) "All the sailors say:
Brandy, you're a fine girl. What a good wife you

03:14:01.755 --> 03:14:02.955
"could be."

03:14:02.955 --> 03:14:04.846
TALIESIN: Oh, you know this one.

03:14:04.846 --> 03:14:12.386
MATT and ASHLEY: "But my life, my lover, my lady
is the sea!"

03:14:12.386 --> 03:14:19.447
(laughter and applause)

03:14:19.447 --> 03:14:22.066
MATT: "I need a drink!" He goes back towards the
bar.

03:14:22.066 --> 03:14:25.121
LAURA: Wait, are we leaving in the morning? When
are we doing this?

03:14:25.121 --> 03:14:26.899
MATT: "When do you want to leave?"

03:14:26.899 --> 03:14:27.930
SAM and LAURA: In the morning.

03:14:27.930 --> 03:14:31.101
TALIESIN: We've got some shopping to do, we've got
to run around a bit.

03:14:31.101 --> 03:14:32.189
SAM: 10:30.

03:14:32.189 --> 03:14:33.057
ASHLEY: Wait a minute.

03:14:33.057 --> 03:14:34.266
SAM: A soft 10:30.

03:14:34.266 --> 03:14:35.488
ASHLEY: Did you already give him the gold?

03:14:35.488 --> 03:14:36.437
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:14:36.437 --> 03:14:37.358
ASHLEY: Hang on.

03:14:37.358 --> 03:14:38.451
TRAVIS: He ain't going to fucking be here in the
morning.

03:14:38.451 --> 03:14:39.615
MATT: "You ain't taking it back!"

03:14:39.615 --> 03:14:46.336
ASHLEY: Excuse me, how do we know you're going to
show up tomorrow? And not just run away with the gold?

03:14:46.336 --> 03:14:48.486
LIAM: Well, he is staying with us this evening.

03:14:48.486 --> 03:14:50.885
ASHLEY: Ah, that's right. You're staying with us.

03:14:50.885 --> 03:14:52.922
MATT: "I'm staying with you?"

03:14:52.922 --> 03:14:54.371
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:14:54.371 --> 03:14:55.884
MATT: "Sure. Fine. Great."

03:14:55.884 --> 03:14:57.095
ASHLEY: Take your pick.

03:14:57.095 --> 03:14:58.475
LAURA: No!

03:14:58.475 --> 03:15:05.675
ASHLEY: Choose wisely.

03:15:05.675 --> 03:15:09.069
TALIESIN: I sleep naked. Thank you.

03:15:09.069 --> 03:15:10.935
MATT: "Ready to snuggle, big lady?"

03:15:10.935 --> 03:15:12.289
ASHLEY: Good choice.

03:15:12.289 --> 03:15:15.248
MARISHA: Yes!

03:15:15.248 --> 03:15:27.452
MATT: He goes and finishes his drink. You're shown
the sleeping quarters for the evening. There is a

03:15:27.452 --> 03:15:31.593
hatch behind and to the back of the bar. It looks
like a dark corner, where there's almost no light.

03:15:31.593 --> 03:15:37.110
The barkeep, Dent, comes over and brings one of
the lanterns off the wall and opens up a hatch,

03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:40.815
and there is a ladder that leads down inside.
Literally, they've cleared out most of the ruin of

03:15:40.815 --> 03:15:45.446
the old establishment below it, and there are four
separate rooms with a small hallway between, like

03:15:45.446 --> 03:15:49.965
a cross-section hallway, that are built as a
subterranean sleeping quarters.

03:15:49.965 --> 03:15:51.139
LAURA: This is so cool!

03:15:51.139 --> 03:15:52.353
ASHLEY: Awesome.

03:15:52.353 --> 03:15:56.655
MATT: There are no windows! It feels very much
like a prison cell with a bed, but it's functional.

03:15:56.655 --> 03:15:59.497
LAURA: Are there two beds in the rooms, or is it
just one bed?

03:15:59.497 --> 03:16:00.695
MATT: One bed per room.

03:16:00.695 --> 03:16:01.653
SAM: Oh, boy.

03:16:01.653 --> 03:16:03.455
MARISHA: Feels very trendy.

03:16:03.455 --> 03:16:04.919
LAURA: Time to snuggle up, Beau!

03:16:04.919 --> 03:16:07.291
MARISHA: Let's do it!

03:16:07.291 --> 03:16:08.932
TRAVIS: Who's taking Kiri?

03:16:08.932 --> 03:16:11.669
LAURA: Oh, Kiri's staying with us.

03:16:11.669 --> 03:16:12.842
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:16:12.842 --> 03:16:17.628
SAM: There's four rooms: one of them is Yasha and
the weirdo--

03:16:17.628 --> 03:16:18.906
TRAVIS: Molly and Fjord.

03:16:18.906 --> 03:16:19.944
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:16:19.944 --> 03:16:21.080
LAURA: And you and Caleb.

03:16:21.080 --> 03:16:28.374
SAM: Okay. As we go into our room, I say to Caleb:
It's not really haunted, is it?

03:16:28.374 --> 03:16:33.349
LIAM: I highly doubt it. I mean, it's possible.

03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:36.400
LAURA: Oh, shit. We need to take the cart to the
stables.

03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:41.114
TALIESIN: We're putting our stuff down and we're
also-- How late is it at this point?

03:16:41.114 --> 03:16:45.415
MATT: It's post-sundown. In the time of searching
the city, having the drink and conversation, it's

03:16:45.415 --> 03:16:47.576
probably close to 9:30, 10:00, probably.

03:16:47.576 --> 03:16:53.564
LAURA: Oh, shit. Maybe we should have the guy take
it. Or should we just leave it outside? I think

03:16:53.564 --> 03:16:54.593
that's a bad idea.

03:16:54.593 --> 03:16:55.652
TALIESIN: That's a terrible idea.

03:16:55.652 --> 03:17:03.209
SAM: Have him take care of it. Well, we know
what's in it. There's inventory, so if anything's

03:17:03.209 --> 03:17:06.411
missing, it's on him. It's on Dent.

03:17:06.411 --> 03:17:10.239
LAURA: Okay, yes, we'll have Dent take it to the
stables.

03:17:10.239 --> 03:17:15.021
MARISHA: Do you think he has insurance to cover
lost goods? Because I don't think he does.

03:17:15.021 --> 03:17:16.945
LIAM: Insurance? No, we are in a podunk town,
there is no insurance here.

03:17:16.945 --> 03:17:19.593
MATT: Taking all the horses and the cart to the
stables, Dent, looking it all over, charges you

03:17:19.593 --> 03:17:21.180
two silver for the service.

03:17:21.180 --> 03:17:24.024
LAURA: Can I insight check him and make sure he's
going to be honest?

03:17:24.024 --> 03:17:26.508
MATT: Go for it.

03:17:26.508 --> 03:17:32.354
LAURA: A natural one. He's the most trustworthy
guy I've ever met in my entire life.

03:17:32.354 --> 03:17:33.580
MATT: Seems above board, yeah.

03:17:33.580 --> 03:17:37.266
MARISHA: Someone should go with him and we get the
valuables off.

03:17:37.266 --> 03:17:40.496
TALIESIN: Are you going to rethread the silver
that is--

03:17:40.496 --> 03:17:46.289
LIAM: Well, we've been here an hour, there are
seven hours-ish left on the spell. That'll get us

03:17:46.289 --> 03:17:48.557
through most of the night.

03:17:48.557 --> 03:17:50.837
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:17:50.837 --> 03:17:52.133
LIAM: What all's in there? You have the--

03:17:52.133 --> 03:17:53.355
MARISHA: Wait, does that go with the cart?

03:17:53.355 --> 03:17:58.207
LIAM: Sure, I thread the cart, but you have the
thingy.

03:17:58.207 --> 03:17:59.394
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:59.394 --> 03:18:01.403
LIAM: That's the most important thing.

03:18:01.403 --> 03:18:07.318
SAM: The only thing on the cart is your thing that
you bought at the festival and some crocodile skins.

03:18:07.318 --> 03:18:09.262
TALIESIN: Yep. Some leather, some armor. There's a
few things.

03:18:09.262 --> 03:18:10.531
LIAM: I'm fine to send it.

03:18:10.531 --> 03:18:11.558
MARISHA: It's fine, yeah.

03:18:11.558 --> 03:18:16.160
LAURA: Okay, here's a couple silver for you. Thank
you.

03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:19.588
MATT: "No worries, happy to help!" He goes and
carries it off and takes care of it for the evening.

03:18:19.588 --> 03:18:24.810
LIAM: Also, Nott, I would not worry: the spookiest
thing in this place is us.

03:18:24.810 --> 03:18:27.196
SAM: That is true.

03:18:27.196 --> 03:18:34.338
MATT: You guys gather your things and bed down for
the evening, taking your respective chambers.

03:18:34.338 --> 03:18:37.858
LIAM: (squeaking) Quick conversation?

03:18:37.858 --> 03:18:38.926
MATT: Sure.

03:18:38.926 --> 03:18:41.077
LIAM: Just, quick.

03:18:41.077 --> 03:18:42.423
SAM: (squeaking)

03:18:42.423 --> 03:18:45.206
(squeaking)

03:18:45.206 --> 03:18:47.742
MATT: That was Kiri.

03:18:47.742 --> 03:18:56.767
LIAM: As the hooligans are getting ready for bed,
I wanted to say to Nott: You know, I think, for

03:18:56.767 --> 03:19:10.263
obvious reasons now, I have kept a lot of things
close to the vest, and those things are out. If

03:19:10.263 --> 03:19:19.856
you ever want to talk about anything-- now or
later, after you think about it-- you are my

03:19:19.856 --> 03:19:25.960
friend, and you can talk to me-- if you want.

03:19:25.960 --> 03:19:36.151
SAM: Well, thank you. You know, I don't want to
burden you with my shit. You've got your own fish

03:19:36.151 --> 03:19:43.075
to fry and your own battles to wage, and I don't
want you to have to worry about me or anything.

03:19:43.075 --> 03:19:54.336
That means a lot to me, and-- oh, hello.

03:19:54.336 --> 03:19:56.439
LIAM: I can't see you through your booze.

03:19:56.439 --> 03:19:57.821
SAM: That's the point.

03:19:57.821 --> 03:20:00.756
MARISHA: Was going to say, it's the full Wilson
effect.

03:20:00.756 --> 03:20:11.879
SAM: I just want you to be okay. It sounds like
this person who corrupted you is out there still,

03:20:11.879 --> 03:20:19.022
and we need to find him and you know, kill him or
whatever? If that's something that you want to do?

03:20:19.022 --> 03:20:30.760
I'm fine focusing on that. I've got my own issues,
but I'm fine taking care of yours first. The thing

03:20:30.760 --> 03:20:41.245
is, your story that you poured out to me and
Beau, the other day-- it was very sad, and I'm so

03:20:41.245 --> 03:20:50.119
sorry that you had to go through it, but I have to
say, in a way, I'm a little bit jealous. Because

03:20:50.119 --> 03:21:04.782
you've done this horrible thing-- not to make
light of it or anything, but it's bad-- and we can

03:21:04.782 --> 03:21:14.459
all tell that you're wearing it in your dirty
clothes and your mussed hair--

03:21:14.459 --> 03:21:16.232
LIAM: I'm clean right now.

03:21:16.232 --> 03:21:21.568
SAM: Well, I know, but still-- You know when
you're dirty and it rains, and it streaks down and

03:21:21.568 --> 03:21:24.691
dries? That's the sort of thing you've got going
on right now.

03:21:24.691 --> 03:21:26.317
TALIESIN: Like you've just kissed Spider-Man.

03:21:26.317 --> 03:21:31.805
LIAM: I mean, an hour in, yeah, but we were in the
rain for like, 48 hours.

03:21:31.805 --> 03:21:34.131
SAM: But you've got a lot of dirt on you.

03:21:34.131 --> 03:21:37.569
LIAM: Yeah, did Laura Bailey put you up to this?

03:21:37.569 --> 03:21:47.714
SAM: No. All I'm saying is, I feel like you can
get revenge. You can maybe even get redemption for

03:21:47.714 --> 03:21:58.311
what you've done, and you can become a better
person. You can do good to counteract the bad that

03:21:58.311 --> 03:22:05.228
you've done in your past, and maybe someday there
will be an end to your suffering.

03:22:05.281 --> 03:22:15.880
LIAM: You're getting ahead of yourself, okay? I am
a garbage person. Let's put that on the table. But

03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:24.637
while I am a piece of shit, we can help each other
in the short term. This is going further than I

03:22:24.637 --> 03:22:31.717
anticipated. I just meant that if-- These
people we are with are all interesting, and

03:22:31.717 --> 03:22:42.689
great-- and untrustworthy, but great-- but I trust
you, which wasn't really true three weeks ago. I

03:22:42.689 --> 03:22:52.340
just mean I wasn't-- I don't know, words don't do
it. Talk to me if you want.

03:22:52.340 --> 03:23:00.232
SAM: All right. Thank you for the offer. Good
night, Caleb.

03:23:00.232 --> 03:23:05.101
LIAM: Gute nacht.

03:23:05.101 --> 03:23:07.171
MARISHA: Hey, Jester?

03:23:07.171 --> 03:23:08.308
LAURA: Yeah?

03:23:08.308 --> 03:23:12.384
MARISHA: What do you think Captain Max-dung,
whatever his name was--

03:23:12.384 --> 03:23:13.581
LAURA: Maximilian.

03:23:13.581 --> 03:23:18.086
MARISHA: Maximilian meant by (exaggeratedly sexy)
"I'll see you again."

03:23:18.086 --> 03:23:22.530
LAURA: I think he was saying something that cute
guys sometimes say, those kind of things.

03:23:22.530 --> 03:23:27.626
MARISHA: Yeah, like, "Ooh, I hope our paths cross
again someday, ooh."

03:23:27.626 --> 03:23:30.759
LAURA: Then later on in the book, you run into him
again, and he remembers you.

03:23:30.759 --> 03:23:34.556
MARISHA: And you're like, "Ooh, that's Captain
Max."

03:23:34.556 --> 03:23:38.510
LAURA: Then he takes off his helmet this time, and
you see that he's got the most fabulous hair that

03:23:38.510 --> 03:23:40.278
blows in the wind.

03:23:40.278 --> 03:23:44.190
MARISHA: Oh, man, you're like, "I never knew he
had such luscious locks, mmm."

03:23:44.190 --> 03:23:47.230
LAURA: Captain Maximilian is probably like that.

03:23:47.230 --> 03:23:51.251
MARISHA: I think so, too. Do you think he had the
hots for any one of us? Do you think that's why he

03:23:51.251 --> 03:23:53.346
said this like, "I want to see you again."

03:23:53.346 --> 03:23:54.720
LAURA: He probably had the hots for you, Beau.

03:23:54.720 --> 03:23:56.360
MARISHA: I think he had the hots for you.

03:23:56.360 --> 03:23:59.357
LAURA: Well, no, probably not!

03:23:59.357 --> 03:24:00.460
MARISHA: I mean.

03:24:00.460 --> 03:24:01.825
LAURA: Maybe it was Yasha!

03:24:01.825 --> 03:24:06.816
MARISHA: (whispering) Maybe it was Yasha. Maybe it
was like, "Ooh, I'm a captain."

03:24:06.816 --> 03:24:09.383
MATT: (like Beau) "Ooh, I'm a captain."

03:24:09.383 --> 03:24:16.394
LAURA: Yeah! Have you ever read Tusk Love, Kiri?

03:24:16.394 --> 03:24:18.111
MATT: (curious chirping)

03:24:18.111 --> 03:24:20.730
LAURA: You know what, maybe Kiri shouldn't read
Tusk Love just yet.

03:24:20.730 --> 03:24:23.234
MATT: (scoots chair closer)

03:24:23.234 --> 03:24:26.230
LAURA: Kiri, how old are your parents?

03:24:26.230 --> 03:24:30.185
MATT: (confused chirping)

03:24:30.185 --> 03:24:31.842
LAURA: You don't know how old they are?

03:24:31.842 --> 03:24:33.262
MATT: (confused chirping)

03:24:33.262 --> 03:24:38.337
LAURA: How old are you compared to most people
that are like you?

03:24:38.337 --> 03:24:41.347
MATT: (confused chirping)

03:24:41.347 --> 03:24:43.393
LAURA: I think that means she's pretty young.

03:24:43.393 --> 03:24:51.114
MARISHA: Yeah. Kiri, where do babies come from?
She doesn't know what the hell we're talking about.

03:24:51.114 --> 03:24:53.869
LAURA: Yes, she does.

03:24:53.869 --> 03:24:55.604
MATT: (like Beau) "Where do babies come from?"

03:24:55.604 --> 03:24:57.945
LAURA: Your voice is very low, Beau!

03:24:57.945 --> 03:24:59.664
MARISHA: Is that how I sound?

03:24:59.664 --> 03:25:00.938
LAURA: You kind of do sound like that.

03:25:00.938 --> 03:25:05.457
MARISHA: Wow, I have a lot to re-evaluate.

03:25:05.457 --> 03:25:08.287
TRAVIS: Got some nuts on you there.

03:25:08.287 --> 03:25:11.945
MARISHA: I have to think about some things. We
should go to sleep.

03:25:11.945 --> 03:25:14.669
LIAM: Hanging brain.

03:25:14.669 --> 03:25:25.900
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to spend the evening
telling Kiri basically the story of Tusk Love--

03:25:25.900 --> 03:25:27.464
SAM: Oh god.

03:25:27.464 --> 03:25:31.186
LAURA: But she doesn't have to read it, I can
leave out the really dirty bits.

03:25:31.186 --> 03:25:35.380
MARISHA: I fall asleep 20 minutes in, drooling a
little.

03:25:35.380 --> 03:25:36.766
LAURA: I tell her all about Oskar.

03:25:36.766 --> 03:25:37.923
MATT: Kiri is just enthralled.

03:25:37.923 --> 03:25:42.626
LAURA: It's the most beautiful love story you've ever
heard in your entire life, basically.

03:25:42.626 --> 03:25:44.608
MATT: (trilling)

03:25:44.608 --> 03:25:52.397
LAURA: I draw pictures of it to illustrate what
I'm talking about.

03:25:52.397 --> 03:26:01.286
MATT: If you could see a blackbird blush. Molly
and Fjord?

03:26:01.286 --> 03:26:06.309
TALIESIN: It's not that I don't trust this place
or like it, but I'm thinking about locking the

03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:11.707
door a little more heavily than normal. I'm going
to wedge my sword underneath the door to make sure

03:26:11.707 --> 03:26:17.098
that it can't open without moving the sword. It's
a lot of new people today.

03:26:17.098 --> 03:26:18.529
TRAVIS: Smart.

03:26:18.529 --> 03:26:19.734
TALIESIN: I don't like new people.

03:26:19.734 --> 03:26:22.386
TRAVIS: Is there any moisture in the corners of
the room?

03:26:22.386 --> 03:26:28.439
MATT: Yeah, and you guys notice, two of the rooms
are dry, two of the rooms have about half an inch

03:26:28.439 --> 03:26:29.845
of water on the floor.

03:26:29.845 --> 03:26:31.562
TRAVIS: Which one is ours?

03:26:31.562 --> 03:26:33.048
MATT: Half an inch of water on the floor.

03:26:33.048 --> 03:26:37.631
TRAVIS: I really don't mind, This is actually
pretty familiar.

03:26:37.631 --> 03:26:41.828
TALIESIN: I'm all right with this as well. This is
fine. I'll take the bed, though, if you're

03:26:41.828 --> 03:26:42.851
offering!

03:26:42.851 --> 03:26:44.287
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

03:26:44.287 --> 03:26:55.894
MATT: All right. The door closes in the chamber.
(gulps drink) "Hello."

03:26:55.894 --> 03:26:59.480
SAM: (electric guitar riff)

03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:04.858
ASHLEY: I start pushing the bed up against the
door.

03:27:04.858 --> 03:27:12.917
MATT: "Interesting. Right, okay." He starts taking
his linen shirt off: it's stained and--

03:27:12.917 --> 03:27:18.689
ASHLEY: Now, you can sleep with your clothes on.

03:27:18.689 --> 03:27:21.239
MATT: "I can, but it's not as comfortable."

03:27:21.239 --> 03:27:25.355
ASHLEY: I throw him a pillow.

03:27:25.355 --> 03:27:28.744
MATT: "All right. You first."

03:27:28.744 --> 03:27:31.050
ASHLEY: I'm sleeping in the bed.

03:27:31.050 --> 03:27:32.823
MATT: "Yeah, me too."

03:27:32.823 --> 03:27:35.063
ASHLEY: No, you didn't pay for this room.

03:27:35.063 --> 03:27:40.689
MATT: "May I sleep in the bed?'"

03:27:40.689 --> 03:27:50.524
ASHLEY: (gum popping) No. You won't fit in the bed
with me. I am very big.

03:27:50.524 --> 03:27:51.705
MATT: "Let's try."

03:27:51.705 --> 03:27:53.084
ASHLEY: Let's not.

03:27:53.084 --> 03:28:06.525
MATT: "Very well." He lays down on the somewhat
slightly waterlogged floor, takes the pillow and

03:28:06.525 --> 03:28:13.435
bundles it up in the corner of the room and lays
down next to it. You have a little oil lamp that

03:28:13.435 --> 03:28:14.858
you can put out.

03:28:14.858 --> 03:28:16.540
ASHLEY: I'm going to leave it on.

03:28:16.540 --> 03:28:18.802
LAURA: Leave that shit on.

03:28:18.802 --> 03:28:21.358
ASHLEY: I sit up against the bed.

03:28:21.358 --> 03:28:29.570
MATT: All right. You guys all eventually get to
sleep. You get an evening's rest, managing to

03:28:29.570 --> 03:28:40.699
adjust to the unpleasant smell of somewhat swamp
bog water-soaked subterranean inn room, but the

03:28:40.699 --> 03:28:46.181
night comes and passes. We'll pick up next week as
the morning comes to.

03:28:46.181 --> 03:28:50.430
LIAM: Febron is totally telling his friends that
he nailed a barbarian.

03:28:50.430 --> 03:28:54.165
ASHLEY: We'll see what happens!

03:28:54.165 --> 03:28:57.543
TALIESIN: It's going to become that story that
everyone hates.

03:28:57.543 --> 03:28:59.273
LIAM: (as Febron) So I had her alone, right?

03:28:59.273 --> 03:29:01.921
MATT: He's a creepy little fuck.

03:29:01.921 --> 03:29:03.185
LAURA: Ew.

03:29:03.185 --> 03:29:08.292
ASHLEY: You never know! He could get lucky!

03:29:08.292 --> 03:29:10.111
LIAM: (as Febron) It's me pheromones!

03:29:10.111 --> 03:29:18.094
MATT: "Gets them everytime, eh?" Thank you, guys!
That was fun. Moving right along.

03:29:18.094 --> 03:29:19.536
LAURA: I like this place.

03:29:19.536 --> 03:29:23.447
MARISHA: I need a new notebook after this
session.

03:29:23.447 --> 03:29:25.419
SAM: You filled that whole thing?!

03:29:25.419 --> 03:29:27.916
TRAVIS: She writes at like font 55.

03:29:27.916 --> 03:29:29.319
MARISHA: I do.

03:29:29.319 --> 03:29:33.759
LIAM: Each page is a centimeter thick, though, on
this book.

03:29:33.759 --> 03:29:36.823
TRAVIS: Yeah, and each page has like 15 words in
it.

03:29:36.823 --> 03:29:40.014
LIAM: But there's illustrations, maps, curse
words, colors--

03:29:40.014 --> 03:29:41.509
MATT: Learn from our monk!

03:29:41.509 --> 03:29:42.820
LIAM: Punisher skulls.

03:29:42.820 --> 03:29:45.447
MARISHA: Skulls are bad guys.

03:29:45.447 --> 03:29:46.882
MATT: Yeah, it's good annotation.

03:29:46.882 --> 03:29:47.958
LAURA: Smart!

03:29:47.958 --> 03:29:50.261
LIAM: Mountain range.

03:29:50.261 --> 03:29:56.312
MARISHA: Oh, you recognized it as a mountain
range! That's great!

03:29:56.312 --> 03:29:58.280
TALIESIN: Who wants the coin in the morning, by
the way?

03:29:58.280 --> 03:29:59.386
LAURA: Oh yeah.

03:29:59.386 --> 03:30:01.835
TALIESIN: I think this is a clever system.

03:30:01.835 --> 03:30:03.536
SAM: We haven't used it, yet.

03:30:03.536 --> 03:30:04.918
TALIESIN: Yeah, but in the morning, somebody gets
it.

03:30:04.918 --> 03:30:05.933
SAM: I'll take it.

03:30:05.933 --> 03:30:12.385
MATT: Nott'll take the Fragment of Probability in
the morning. We'll pick this up next Thursday!

03:30:12.385 --> 03:30:17.174
Also, we're going to have a guest next week.

03:30:17.174 --> 03:30:18.620
LAURA: We are?!

03:30:18.620 --> 03:30:20.161
MATT: I've told you this a number of times.

03:30:20.161 --> 03:30:22.330
LIAM: I remembered, Matthew.

03:30:22.330 --> 03:30:23.560
MATT: Thank you.

03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:24.867
SAM: Playing the kenku?

03:30:24.867 --> 03:30:31.406
MATT: No. We have a guest: my brother from another
motherland for the past decade in the world of

03:30:31.406 --> 03:30:37.345
D&amp;amp;D. Some of you may know him from his online D&amp;amp;D
stream, High Rollers: Mark Hulmes will be in town

03:30:37.345 --> 03:30:40.080
and joining us as a guest next week.

03:30:40.080 --> 03:30:41.401

03:30:41.401 --> 03:30:42.296
MATT: Too bad, he's coming.

03:30:42.296 --> 03:30:44.118
MARISHA: We already had Kit. We already had an
Englishwoman.

03:30:44.118 --> 03:30:45.551
LIAM: She was the last one.

03:30:45.551 --> 03:30:49.306
SAM: (exaggerated American accent) But only if he
does an American accent.

03:30:49.306 --> 03:30:53.546
MARISHA: I want full Benedict Cumberbatch.

03:30:53.546 --> 03:30:55.638
SAM: (exaggerated American accent) I'm from
California.

03:30:55.638 --> 03:31:00.039
MATT: If we could get it out of him at some point,
that'd be great.

03:31:00.039 --> 03:31:02.725
TALIESIN: I love a fake American accent.

03:31:02.725 --> 03:31:07.444
MATT: Mark's a long-time friend. He came and
watched the show live when we first started

03:31:07.444 --> 03:31:13.196
streaming long ago. Happy to have him come in and
join us next week. Excited for that, Mark. We'll

03:31:13.196 --> 03:31:18.318
see you then. The rest of you, rest well, have a
wonderful weekend. You as well. We love you, and

03:31:18.318 --> 03:31:21.782
is it Thursday yet? Good night!

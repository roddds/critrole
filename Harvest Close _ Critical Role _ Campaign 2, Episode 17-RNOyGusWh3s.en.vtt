00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:04.434
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:10.595
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. We'll jump into the game here

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:14.477
shortly, but we have some quick announcements to get
through. First and foremost, congratulations Sam

00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:16.771
on his Emmy win!

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:20.341
(cheering)

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.759
TRAVIS: You suck!

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.608
SAM: I did it, guys!

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:29.384
MATT: Thanks to one of our wonderful sponsors
tonight, I was able to add an Emmy to his

00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:31.868
inventory from my phone just moments ago!

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:39.796
SAM: Yeah, I'm looking in my inventory right now.
It says "Emmy Award of Exempla--" It won't tell me

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:41.388
the rest of the title!

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:43.221
(laughter)

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.816
MATT: Exemplary Talent.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:48.870
SAM: It's a wondrous item! "Rarity: Legendary.
This enchanted statue was given to the finest of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:58.565
"creatives in the land. It's a large thinly-coated
lead icon made of cheap material." I'm going to

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:02.666
take a picture of that later. That's so cool!

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:07.287
MATT: That object brought to you by our first
sponsor tonight and sponsor for the campaign thus

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:11.530
far, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.854
SAM: Guys, as you know, this week I received many
emails from fans who loved our D&amp;D Beyond ad last

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:31.585
week. And they told me that I had missed part of
the story. To recap, our sponsor is D&amp;D Beyond.

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:39.222
They are contributing $100 to 826LA for every
natural one we roll. Also, as part of their

00:01:39.222 --> 00:01:45.590
massive 826LA charity initiative, we're past the
$10,000 tier, so D&amp;D Beyond has offered up the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.845
discount code "826LA" for 25% off their awesome
Legendary Bundle, which includes all the digital

00:01:52.845 --> 00:02:00.392
materials available on D&amp;D Beyond. Last week, to
honor that, I had dug through the archives and

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:07.746
found a commercial that D&amp;D Beyond had run in the
'80s. We did a staged reading of it.

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:08.996
LAURA: It was great.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:16.153
SAM: Fans wrote in and said, "Sam, you missed part
of that story." The ad campaign in the '80s was

00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:22.502
not successful. However, it launched the career of
the young actress who played Gail in the

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:30.005
commercial. She was given her own spin-off sitcom
on CBS. It only ran four episodes, and those

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:38.850
episodes have been lost to time. But I was able to
find the script of a promo for the sitcom starring

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.012
Gail, from the D&amp;D Beyond commercial, from the
80s!

00:02:44.012 --> 00:02:45.691
ASHLEY: Really?!

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:53.121
SAM: Found it in the archives. We're going to do a
staged reading of this promo for this sitcom.

00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:58.615
Brought to you by D&amp;D Beyond. I'll be playing
Announcer; reprising their roles will be Laura as

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:05.067
the mom, Taliesin as the dad, and Ashley The
Johnson as Gail.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.057
LAURA: Gail!

00:03:07.057 --> 00:03:16.894
SAM: Here we go. Picture it. You're watching TV.
It's 8:30PM, primetime, and this promo comes on.

00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:22.800
(announcer voice) "This fall on CBS, it's the
hilarious sitcom everyone's "stoked" about:

00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:24.922
"You've Got Gail!"

00:03:24.922 --> 00:03:27.916
TALIESIN: There are holes in all of my business
pants!

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.581
LAURA: <i>Gail!</i>

00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:34.734
ASHLEY: Take a chill pill, Mrs. Henderson! I need
those crotches for my Home Ec project!

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:40.372
LAURA: This says, "Sew a quilt of fabric
<i>swatches</i>, not fabric <i>crotches</i>!"

00:03:40.372 --> 00:03:41.835
ASHLEY: Oops!

00:03:41.835 --> 00:03:44.558
(laughter)

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:50.660
SAM: That lovable scamp Gail gets her foster
parents, the Hendersons, into totally "gnarly" situations.

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.696
TALIESIN: Did you do your chores, Gail?

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:57.760
ASHLEY: Ch-yeah! Now I'm going to put on my
British Knight Sneakers and see that brand-new

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.467
movie, Labyrinth.

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:01.137
(laughter)

00:04:01.137 --> 00:04:05.666
LAURA: Not so fast, young lady. I found my tuna
casserole in the garbage.

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:11.269
ASHLEY: No doy, Mrs. Henderson! You said, "Take
out the trash," and it was the stinkiest thing in

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.868
the house.

00:04:13.328 --> 00:04:17.945
SAM: But it's not all fun and games. You've Got
Gail also tackles serious issues.

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:25.142
LAURA: Gail, your friend from school was just in a
car accident. She was drunk driving.

00:04:25.142 --> 00:04:29.078
ASHLEY: (quietly) Gag me with a spoon, Mrs.
Henderson.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:32.689
TALIESIN: Yes, Gail. Gag us <i>all</i> with a spoon.

00:04:32.732 --> 00:04:34.521
(laughter)

00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:41.645
SAM: You won't believe the trouble Gail gets into
every Thursday night!

00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:46.280
LAURA: Gail, why didn't you do your report on
First Ladies?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.540
ASHLEY: Because current First Lady Nancy Reagan
gave me some bitching advice!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.515
TALIESIN: What kind of advice did Nancy Reagan
give you?

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:57.266
ASHLEY: When teacher says, "Do your homework,"
just say no!

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:59.203
TALIESIN and LAURA: <i>Gail!</i>

00:04:59.203 --> 00:05:03.064
ASHLEY: Gag me with a spoon, Mr. and Mrs.
Henderson!

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:07.606
SAM: All-new You've Got Gail, every week right
after Growing Pains and before She's the Sheriff.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:10.206
Presented by D&amp;D Beyond!

00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:13.874
(laughter)

00:05:13.874 --> 00:05:15.966
TRAVIS: Oh my god. It just gets better!

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:20.099
SAM: The character of Gail is amazing.

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:26.661
MATT: If Yasha ever leaves us this campaign, you
already have a backup character.

00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:28.518
TRAVIS: Can I ask how you spell "doy?"

00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:30.262
SAM: D-O-Y.

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:34.439
LIAM: I just got a text alert. They just revoked
his Emmy.

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.713
(laughter)

00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:39.353
TRAVIS: Due to unforeseen circumstances--

00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:46.033
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for
making this happen. We have another sponsor

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:53.215
returning this week: our friends at Obsidian for
Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire! Super excited.

00:05:53.215 --> 00:05:58.111
First off, for those who aren't familiar with it,
Pillars of Eternity was a great RPG. Isometric,

00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:04.116
classic-style RPG for PC and console later this
year. You get to return to the world of Eora. This

00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:07.716
one is on the hunt for one of the gods, Eothas,
which plays into the story from the first game.

00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:11.738
You don't have to have played the first one to
play the sequel, because they have built in a way

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:14.731
that gets you up to speed very quickly and
basically choose your decisions that you start the

00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:20.108
game to still influence the story and where you're
going. A lot of the main characters in the story

00:06:20.108 --> 00:06:27.196
are voiced by us here at the table! Which is
awesome. For a free DLC download, you'll be able

00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:32.568
to download the portraits of Vox Machina as well
as voice sets to use in the game for your main

00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:38.756
character and entire party. Check it out if you
haven't had a chance yet. It's an awesome RPG

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:42.677
series. Unbiased as I couldn't possibly be because
I was one of the first Kickstarter backers before

00:06:42.677 --> 00:06:47.497
I was even part of the game. It's great. I really
enjoyed it. Check it out if you can. It comes out

00:06:47.497 --> 00:06:55.856
next week on Tuesday, May 8th. You can order it at
versusevil.com/criticalrole. They've released

00:06:55.856 --> 00:07:00.795
almost all the portraits so far, just in the past
couple of days. They've released Keyleth and Grog today.

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:04.640
LAURA: Keyleth's was adorable!

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.681
MATT: He's a real angry--!

00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:10.217
TRAVIS: Just a Vidal Sassoon face right now.

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:15.631
LIAM: You can see the bits of food flying out of
his mouth.

00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:18.894
MATT: I believe tomorrow they unveil Gilmore.

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:21.703
LAURA: That had been released already?

00:07:21.703 --> 00:07:32.297
MATT: Yeah. Spoiler alert. Yeah, excited for that.
Thank you to our friends at Obsidian for allowing

00:07:32.297 --> 00:07:34.752
us to be part of this awesome game.

00:07:34.752 --> 00:07:38.991
LIAM: Oh man, I am going to play that game. That
is saying something, because I have no time for my

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:43.094
own physical or mental health! It's going to
happen.

00:07:43.094 --> 00:07:49.034
LAURA: I am definitely going to be playing that
game, like right after the baby's born.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:55.879
SAM: You'll have time. Get a wireless headphone so
you don't wake him or her.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:58.087
TRAVIS: Me. Don't wake me.

00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:00.753
SAM: Yeah. Just play. It'll be great.

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:07.767
MATT: All righty. Next up, we announced today that
we are headed to Gen Con! We're stoked about that.

00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:14.343
You can go to critrole.com for any of the
information regarding our schedule that week.

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:18.087

00:08:18.087 --> 00:08:22.082
weekend. Check out critrole.com for information on

Super excited to see you! We are also super close

Mark, who has been so amazing in supporting this
endeavor. When we hit $50,000, I believe you will

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.108
be running another one-shot.

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:10.220
MARISHA: Another honey heist! More bears are back
in town.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.592
LIAM: Make it happen.

00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:14.100
SAM: (singing) The bears are back in town!

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.078

podcasts are available to download, so keep up
with that. That's it! We're good! Done! Anything else?

00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:18.074
MARISHA: Nice. That was a lot.

00:10:18.074 --> 00:10:25.725
MATT: I want to get into the game. I'm impatient.
Thank you for your patience. With that guys, let's

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:30.834
go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:34.318
[click, TV static]

00:10:34.515 --> 00:11:48.477
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:11:52.677 --> 00:11:55.505
MATT: Wow, you are so late on that!

00:11:55.505 --> 00:11:58.374
LIAM: Nah, it was timed about how I wanted it.

00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:04.742
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. As we watch Laura
complain about her macaroni salad.

00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:07.891
LAURA: Is it like tuna in here? What's in here?

00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:10.201
LIAM: This is the content you tuned in for.

00:12:10.201 --> 00:12:12.167
LAURA: Is there tuna in here? I think there is.

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:13.433
TALIESIN: No one really knows.

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:16.051
MATT: Macaroni salad is the Wild West of culinary
delights.

00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:18.627
ASHLEY: It's the tuna casserole you were talking
about.

00:12:18.627 --> 00:12:21.859
LAURA: I'm not supposed to have tuna!

00:12:21.859 --> 00:12:24.703
(laughter)

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:30.632
MATT: Daredevil Laura Bailey, ladies and
gentlemen. Bringing it back in. The Mighty Nein in

00:12:30.632 --> 00:12:35.554
the city of Zadash. Long in the Dwendalian Empire,
you've made a small name for yourself in a few

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:42.012
factions. You've done a deed or two for the King's
Hall here in service of the Crown. You've done a

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:48.768
deed or two with the Knights of Requital, that
involved getting caught up briefly in a manhunt,

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:54.759
as you were loosely responsible for the death of
the High-Richter, the high judge of the local

00:12:54.759 --> 00:13:03.242
court. Managed to make an introductory trade, a
deal if you will, with The Gentleman, this

00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:11.399
subterranean figure of not the most legal of
maneuvers. You delved deep into one of the

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:15.914
subterranean river tunnels beneath the city of
Zadash for him, managed to clear out and recover

00:13:15.914 --> 00:13:22.408
materials from a long-buried research facility
from the Age of Arcanum.

00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:27.250
Upon returning, the deal was solid. You managed to
smuggle out Horris, who needed to be away from the

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.822
town for the time being while this investigation
was happening. In doing so, also managed to clear

00:13:31.822 --> 00:13:39.658
your names of the death of the High-Richter. Upon
returning back, getting a few deeds done, now

00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:45.365
waiting for this to blow over, and hearing word
that there is no longer a manhunt for a number of

00:13:45.365 --> 00:13:53.395
you in cahoots to this, you begin to prepare for
the coming Harvest Close Festival. Now we're

00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:58.472
getting close to the third of the month of
Fessuran, you've all managed to prepare in the

00:13:58.472 --> 00:14:04.446
ways you want, got a few things on your side.
You've delved into some of the mysteries of the

00:14:04.446 --> 00:14:12.360
beacon that you maintain. You've retrieved your
Forever Alcoholic Flask. That's where we'll begin

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:22.557
today. Friends, as the early morning creeps up
upon you, the chilled morning air has left a bit

00:14:22.557 --> 00:14:30.013
of ice and mist crawling across areas of the city
floor, from outside your window here in the Leaky

00:14:30.013 --> 00:14:36.103
Tap tavern. However, though it is a gloomy
morning, there is already a general air of

00:14:36.103 --> 00:14:41.863
celebration around. Glancing across, more people
are now shifting out into the street and city

00:14:41.863 --> 00:14:45.972
around you. Music is beginning to creep into the
vicinity, and you can hear muffling through the

00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:47.716
nearby walls.

00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:50.906
LAURA: Well struck, my lord!

00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:53.244
TRAVIS: (high voice) Well struck, my lord!

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.856
MATT: As you all awaken, hearing this outside,
what do you wish to do?

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:04.575
LAURA: (gasps) It's a celebration!

00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:09.843
SAM: Your spidey sense is tingling?

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:12.509
LAURA: Yes. Can you hear the difference?

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:21.738
TALIESIN: It sounds like there's very expensive
things to drink and eat. I'm going to get my pocketbook.

00:15:22.468 --> 00:15:24.382
SAM: Lots of pockets to pick!

00:15:26.506 --> 00:15:30.853
MARISHA: Lots of bar brawls to start. Yeah.

00:15:30.853 --> 00:15:40.252
LIAM: Can I ask a retroactive question? Caleb, and
maybe Beauregard, read all of Siff's journal?

00:15:40.592 --> 00:15:41.192
MATT: Yep.

00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:44.308
LIAM: Was anything more to be gleaned from reading
the entire thing?

00:15:44.748 --> 00:15:49.723
MATT: Just more understanding of the same notes
you read before. From what remains of the tome,

00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:54.633
you managed to quickly grab the Cliff Notes of it
as you glanced through it, and the more

00:15:54.633 --> 00:16:00.701
information you pulled from it filled out that
your thoughts on those tidbits were correct.

00:16:00.701 --> 00:16:06.721
LIAM: Okay, and then the only other question I
have is I don't remember what time of day the

00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:13.910
party ended the day. If there was time I would've
used paper and scrolls to transcribe into my book,

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.415
if there was time.

00:16:15.715 --> 00:16:17.856
MATT: Yeah, there's been a few days. You would've
had time.

00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:18.923
LIAM: Okay, good.

00:16:21.493 --> 00:16:22.689
LAURA: Is it the morning?

00:16:22.689 --> 00:16:24.879
MATT: It is the morning. You have awoken--

00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:30.754
LAURA: I'm going to spend a minute focusing on the
mote and get a point!

00:16:30.754 --> 00:16:33.700
SAM: On the what? The mote?

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:42.886
MATT: She takes the beacon, focusing on this
strange artifact that you procured from the grip

00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:51.488
of the Xhorhasian assassin. You feel yourself
extend into it and now being your first time to

00:16:51.488 --> 00:16:58.088
focus on it, it's a lot to take in. You feel your
essence shift into this space, this strange

00:16:58.088 --> 00:17:05.450
dimensional between. Though not fully
understanding it, you're brought the same image of

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:10.922
dozens of yourself and this sense of infinity.
There before you, you see the strange gray mote,

00:17:10.922 --> 00:17:15.717
and you reach out in the way that you saw Caleb's
hand reach. At that moment, you feel it shift and

00:17:15.717 --> 00:17:21.623
vanish into your chest, the warmth sifting into
the center of your rib cage and then your eyes

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:23.751
focus once more, and you're back in your chamber.

00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:26.967
MARISHA: Well, that was kind of cool.

00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:30.145
LAURA: Did you know that we have a special weapon
now?

00:17:30.145 --> 00:17:33.168
MARISHA: I do as of right now with you telling
me.

00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:41.662
LAURA: This thing, you can get this mote of
possibility. Basically, you get to affect time.

00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:45.031
I'm not exactly sure how it works, but it's really
cool.

00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:48.404
MARISHA: Do you feel all right?

00:17:48.404 --> 00:17:51.552
LAURA: I feel really powerful and stuff, inside.

00:17:51.552 --> 00:17:53.179
MARISHA: Like how much more powerful?

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:55.323
LAURA: Like five percent.

00:17:55.323 --> 00:17:57.032
MARISHA: Punch me. I want to tell.

00:17:57.032 --> 00:17:58.672
LAURA: Okay. I'll punch her.

00:17:58.672 --> 00:18:00.663
MATT: All right, roll an attack.

00:18:02.753 --> 00:18:11.369
LAURA: Oh jeez, I dropped it. That doesn't count.
I don't punch her very hard. I'm going to pull my

00:18:11.369 --> 00:18:15.152
punch, because I only rolled a five.

00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:17.810
LIAM: That sounded like "pooing my pants."

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.311
MATT: I mean, if you're not dodging.

00:18:22.221 --> 00:18:24.020
MARISHA: I'm like, come on.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.360
MATT: Yeah, then you hit her.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.241
LAURA: Oh, I hit her? Yes! Okay, so now I roll for
damage?

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:30.089
MATT: Well it's one plus your strength modifier.

00:18:30.089 --> 00:18:31.809
LAURA: Four damage!

00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:35.189
MATT: You take four points of damage from a sheer
punch to your shoulder!

00:18:35.189 --> 00:18:38.025
MARISHA: Holy shit, Jester! What the fuck?

00:18:38.025 --> 00:18:39.647
LAURA: <i>Rawr!</i>

00:18:39.647 --> 00:18:42.074
MARISHA: Ow! Okay, that's awesome.

00:18:42.074 --> 00:18:43.373
LAURA: Do you have dead arm?

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:43.892
MARISHA: Yes!

00:18:43.892 --> 00:18:47.719
LAURA: Wait, if I punch you in your ass you'll get
dead leg. Have you ever tried it? Yeah, I punch

00:18:47.719 --> 00:18:49.828
her in her butt and try to give her dead leg.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:52.331
MATT: Okay, I think she is dodging this one so
roll for this one.

00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:59.760
LAURA: Oh man, come on! What do I add to it?

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.742
MATT: I'll say you're proficient in unarmed
because you're just punching, sure. You add your

00:19:05.742 --> 00:19:07.293
strength modifier and your proficiency modifier.

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:13.548
LAURA: This is shit. Oh plus the proficiency. No,
it's still not enough. It's like nine. <i>Nein</i>!

00:19:13.548 --> 00:19:18.229
MATT: She does manage to step out of the way, now
being more defensive from giving her a dead leg.

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:23.506
MARISHA: I move and do a little hip bump. Get out
of the way.

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:26.961
LAURA: I wasn't trying to hit you anyway. I didn't
want to hit you.

00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:30.842
MARISHA: Just a little hip action, I've been
working on it.

00:19:31.722 --> 00:19:37.662
LAURA: Anyway, I have this thing, and I could've
used it then to really hit you but I'm not going

00:19:37.662 --> 00:19:42.602
to. I'm going to save it for something really
powerful. Are you in the room, Yasha?

00:19:42.602 --> 00:19:49.092
ASHLEY: I feel like I slept outside? I was going
to interact. I think I slept outside. I forgot.

00:19:50.252 --> 00:19:52.565
TALIESIN: I think we're all up and moving at this
point.

00:19:52.565 --> 00:19:54.419
MATT: As you ask this question, Yasha is not in
the room.

00:19:54.419 --> 00:20:04.850
MARISHA: Hey, Jester. That was you who said
something when you were talking to the Xhorhasian

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.320
assassin about babies not being born, or something
like that?

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.049
LAURA: Did I say something like that?

00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:15.834
MARISHA: I think you were like, "Oh no, the
babies!" Something about babies.

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:26.219
LAURA: He had said that this thing would help them
with having babies, yeah. I would assume if we

00:20:26.219 --> 00:20:28.525
have it then he won't be able to have babies.

00:20:28.525 --> 00:20:34.122
MARISHA: You know how that town crier was talking
about kids being stolen? You think they're connected?

00:20:35.659 --> 00:20:38.112
LAURA: Probably. That's really smart, Beau.

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:40.878
MARISHA: Thanks. I wanted to run it by you.

00:20:40.878 --> 00:20:49.054
LAURA: Where was it happening? It was along the
border, huh? In Nogvurot? Yeah, that's where it

00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:50.094
was happening.

00:20:50.094 --> 00:20:51.367
MARISHA: You have a good memory.

00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:51.856
LAURA: I know.

00:20:51.856 --> 00:20:53.449
SAM: (whispering) Where is that?

00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:55.049
LAURA: Nogvurot is along the border.

00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:57.657
MARISHA: I know there's a garrison out there.

00:20:57.657 --> 00:20:59.790
LAURA: (laughter) Northward.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:00.855
MATT: You have a map.

00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:02.534
SAM: Is it near Xhorhas?

00:21:02.534 --> 00:21:04.235
LAURA: I brought it back in, didn't I?

00:21:05.255 --> 00:21:09.961
MARISHA: Oh, it doesn't count as using your memory
if you're reading it, Jester. Come on! That's not fair.

00:21:09.961 --> 00:21:12.793
LAURA: I didn't read it! I'm pulling my map out
now.

00:21:14.493 --> 00:21:18.359
MATT: Nogvurot is actually northward, a little bit
east of Rexxentrum.

00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:20.841
SAM: Right there.

00:21:20.841 --> 00:21:26.507
LAURA: Oh, that's not at all where I thought it
was. I thought it was over by the Ashguard

00:21:26.507 --> 00:21:33.753
Garrison, but it's not. Yeah, weird. Maybe it's
not connected, then. Unless there are a lot of

00:21:33.753 --> 00:21:38.810
them, the bad guys, in Nogvurot, which we could
check out.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.393
MARISHA: I heard a rumor last night that more are
getting through. I don't know.

00:21:42.393 --> 00:21:47.015
LAURA: I wonder how. I wonder if there's an
underground passage that people aren't seeing or

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:54.479
something. Or maybe they can go invisible. Or
maybe they have an airship! Or maybe they can turn

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:59.403
into mist, and fly through the air where people
can't see them. I've heard of people doing that.

00:21:59.403 --> 00:22:00.970
MARISHA: All possibilities, yeah.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.482
TRAVIS: (knocking) Y'all up?

00:22:03.482 --> 00:22:04.243
MARISHA: No!

00:22:04.243 --> 00:22:06.777
LAURA: Fjord! Come in!

00:22:06.777 --> 00:22:07.983
TRAVIS: We're going out.

00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:10.119
MARISHA: I'm naked! I'm not naked.

00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:12.567
LAURA: Fjord! There's a celebration going
outside!

00:22:14.517 --> 00:22:17.832
TRAVIS: I can hear them. I think we're going to
head downstairs if y'all want to join.

00:22:17.832 --> 00:22:20.886
LAURA: Yes! I run outside.

00:22:22.476 --> 00:22:26.601
MATT: All right, so you guys start heading
downstairs. Who all is gathering down there with them?

00:22:27.362 --> 00:22:28.131
SAM: Everybody!

00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:35.175
MATT: All right, everybody. Yasha, you napped in
the side alleyway in the open air, sleeping with

00:22:35.175 --> 00:22:43.112
one eye open, being careful. As you wake up in the
cold morning mist, the mist has caused this

00:22:43.112 --> 00:22:45.515
dampness around your chin and hair--

00:22:45.515 --> 00:22:47.115
ASHLEY: Around my glorious beard?

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:49.270
MATT: Your glorious beard, right there. Frost
beard.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.150
ASHLEY: I don't have a beard.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:56.108
MATT: No. It gets really cold in the early morning
and bits of frost have gathered at the edges of

00:22:56.108 --> 00:23:03.165
your hair, so you brush off it a bit. As you
gather yourself and look out past the street, the

00:23:03.165 --> 00:23:07.069
music's already starting to swell very strongly
from a distance, and a few musicians come by

00:23:07.069 --> 00:23:14.139
playing on their own. Some folks are starting to
rouse and begin cooking things. The smell of meats

00:23:14.139 --> 00:23:22.182
and fresh morning meals are beginning to find your
nostrils, and you decide you probably should check in.

00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:23.761
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go check in.

00:23:23.761 --> 00:23:31.437
MATT: You come in, the rest of you all gather in
the bottom tavern area of the Leaky Tap. What

00:23:31.437 --> 00:23:32.482
would you like to do?

00:23:34.242 --> 00:23:39.433
SAM: Does anyone know how this festival works?
What are we celebrating again?

00:23:39.883 --> 00:23:42.097
LAURA: The close of the harvest.

00:23:42.477 --> 00:23:47.741
SAM: It's just for funsies and we go around and
sample wares and things?

00:23:47.741 --> 00:23:50.300
MARISHA: Nott, have you never been to a festival?

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.494
SAM: I've been to a festival.

00:23:52.494 --> 00:23:56.427
TRAVIS: It's general revelry. You know: drink,
eat, dance.

00:23:56.427 --> 00:23:59.697
SAM: Not a big one. You know, small ones.

00:23:59.697 --> 00:24:01.235
LAURA: About what?

00:24:02.765 --> 00:24:09.273
SAM: You know, end of the season and beginning of
the season. You know, that sort of stuff. People's

00:24:09.273 --> 00:24:11.170
weddings, that sort of thing.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:19.188
MATT: There's a new female who's running the bar.
She is now also coming to consciousness. She's

00:24:19.188 --> 00:24:25.684
coming around to preparing the bar. Passed out,
face down. Looks to be in her early 50s or so,

00:24:25.684 --> 00:24:30.038
long black hair that goes just past the chest
area--

00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:32.090
LAURA: The chest area?

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:40.479
MATT: Respectfully choosing words, Laura. Past her
heaping bosom? What do you want me to say?!

00:24:40.719 --> 00:24:42.335
TALIESIN: I think you've had enough.

00:24:42.705 --> 00:24:45.319
LIAM: Right around her titties? The titty area?

00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:47.602
TRAVIS: Take that tuna away.

00:24:47.602 --> 00:24:49.687
TALIESIN: It's making you weird.

00:24:50.497 --> 00:24:56.519
MATT: Laura Bailey, forward-thinking feminist!
(laughter)

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:57.455
LAURA: I'm sorry.

00:24:57.455 --> 00:24:58.914
MATT: It's all right.

00:25:01.224 --> 00:25:06.426
LIAM: Once you have a child, I want you to turn on
a dime like a Tartuffe character and be matronly

00:25:06.426 --> 00:25:07.232
and severe.

00:25:08.212 --> 00:25:09.047
SAM: Don't curse!

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:11.663
MATT: That's not going to happen.

00:25:11.663 --> 00:25:13.384
LAURA: Don't talk about titties!

00:25:14.484 --> 00:25:19.719
MATT: Anyway, this female you haven't seen before
who's in the process of running the bar, very much

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:27.472
in the same way that you saw Wessek the
dragonborn, or previous before that, Claudia.

00:25:30.482 --> 00:25:32.131
LAURA: (whispering) I wonder if that's the new
owner.

00:25:32.131 --> 00:25:37.350
MARISHA: Yeah. Wait, what's she look like? Did you
say something?

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.137
MATT: Human, 50s, long black hair.

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.462
LAURA: Past the tatas.

00:25:40.462 --> 00:25:43.771
MARISHA: I bet that's her. Oh, that's right. I got
so distracted by you.

00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:50.519
ASHLEY: I'll walk in and give them a nod, and then
go get an ale. First things first.

00:25:51.729 --> 00:25:53.055
MATT: "What can I get you?"

00:25:53.055 --> 00:25:57.137
ASHLEY: Just a big a drink, an ale.

00:25:57.137 --> 00:26:02.837
MATT: "Easy enough to do. I'll be right back," and
she goes and fetches you a drink. All right, so.

00:26:02.837 --> 00:26:09.882
For this part of the festival-- are you going for
an ale or a stiff drink?

00:26:09.882 --> 00:26:12.201
ASHLEY: An ale. It's morning.

00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:13.510
TRAVIS: Slow burn.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.829
LIAM: I wonder if the new proprietor knows there
is a dead person in the basement.

00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:24.652
SAM: It's not a dead person. It's a skeleton. It
seems old. I mean I suppose it's a dead person.

00:26:24.652 --> 00:26:26.877
LIAM: That is exactly what it is.

00:26:26.877 --> 00:26:28.345
SAM: I guess so.

00:26:28.345 --> 00:26:31.591
LAURA: Was it a dead human or a dead tiefling or a
dead--

00:26:31.591 --> 00:26:32.963
SAM: It seemed human-ish.

00:26:32.963 --> 00:26:37.259
LIAM: Well there were no horns, and when you're a
skeleton your ears are rotted away so I do not know.

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:39.195
LAURA: It could've been an elf.

00:26:39.195 --> 00:26:40.419
LIAM: It could've been.

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:45.901
TRAVIS: Are there any people, I don't know,
juggling and shit? Or any shows going on?

00:26:45.944 --> 00:26:50.171
MATT: Not in the tavern currently. It seems most
everyone outside is walking in one direction,

00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:54.256
though. A lot of the folks that are starting to
gather are all heading past the entranceway and

00:26:54.256 --> 00:26:59.050
heading in a leftward path from looking out from
the tavern.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.535
SAM: Should we join them?

00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:02.106
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to see.

00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:04.071
TALIESIN: I definitely want to see this.

00:27:04.071 --> 00:27:09.596
MARISHA: You can carry booze in the streets here,
right? It's like Vegas? Open carry?

00:27:09.596 --> 00:27:16.316
SAM: Wait! No, not open carry. Open container.

00:27:16.316 --> 00:27:22.474
MATT: There you go. You have seen people walk with
various drinks in their hand without an issue before.

00:27:22.753 --> 00:27:23.718
SAM: Let's go!

00:27:23.718 --> 00:27:26.505
TALIESIN: I'm very much about this. We'll get that
to-go.

00:27:26.505 --> 00:27:29.933
MARISHA: How was the new lady? Was she nice, was
she a bitch?

00:27:29.933 --> 00:27:34.889
ASHLEY: She just, I mean, she gives you your
drink, so I think it's a nice woman to me.

00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:36.690
SAM: What was her name?

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.355
ASHLEY: I have no idea.

00:27:38.355 --> 00:27:40.707
MARISHA: I bet she's a bitch.

00:27:40.707 --> 00:27:42.491
LAURA: Why would you say that?

00:27:42.491 --> 00:27:46.699
MARISHA: I don't know. Because I want to buy this
place, so I don't want to like her.

00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:49.701
LIAM: Do you know that there is a dead person in
the basement here?

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:53.178
MARISHA: Maybe we can use that to run her out!

00:27:53.178 --> 00:27:55.363
LAURA: There's a skeleton in the basement,
apparently.

00:27:55.363 --> 00:27:56.111
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:27:56.111 --> 00:27:59.100
TALIESIN: I sort of agree with Nott on this, I
think there comes a point where it's a skeleton

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.450
and not an actual dead person at this point. I
mean, I know it is a dead person.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.409
LIAM: I don't think that's correct, actually. I
think it's both things at the same time.

00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:08.658
TALIESIN: I think there's a point where it's like
a piece of fruit, but it's been out so long that

00:28:08.658 --> 00:28:12.392
even conceiving of it as a piece of fruit is not
useful.

00:28:12.392 --> 00:28:13.597
MARISHA: That's a good point.

00:28:13.597 --> 00:28:14.837
LIAM: I am pretty sure that's incorrect.

00:28:14.837 --> 00:28:17.266
MARISHA: Do you call a cherry pit a dead cherry?

00:28:17.266 --> 00:28:19.204
TRAVIS: I start walking towards the--

00:28:19.204 --> 00:28:24.964
LAURA: Could you still eat the body? If you can't
eat the body anymore then it's not a person.

00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:27.531
LIAM: You can eat anything if you are determined
enough.

00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:29.857
TALIESIN: That is also a very fair point.

00:28:29.857 --> 00:28:34.088
MATT: Fjord has left the Schrödinger's skeleton
conversation.

00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:39.932
TALIESIN: Fjord, don't you dare have fun without
us! I'm rolling out the door.

00:28:39.932 --> 00:28:41.737
MATT: Go for it. Molly gives chase.

00:28:41.737 --> 00:28:43.643
LAURA: I chase after them too.

00:28:43.643 --> 00:28:45.957
SAM: I'll put on my mask and join.

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:48.485
ASHLEY: Slam down my-- go.

00:28:48.485 --> 00:28:58.423
MATT: At this point now, the chilled late morning
beneath the cloud covered skies, the streets are

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.962
filled with all manner of people and families
walking with baskets and colored streamers behind

00:29:02.962 --> 00:29:08.263
them. The large banners of silk of the autumn
colors that were previously being placed up in the

00:29:08.263 --> 00:29:13.827
streets are in full display. The gentle wind is
causing them to flicker and flap as the music

00:29:13.845 --> 00:29:20.280
weaves with the sound of the fabric. Small bands
of bards and musicians mark nearly every street

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:26.252
intersection, filling the air with music, poems,
and cheer. It's a very stark difference to the

00:29:26.252 --> 00:29:33.133
lock-down that held the city over the past week
and a half or so. The closer you begin to follow

00:29:33.133 --> 00:29:39.690
the crowds as they move along, hearing the
chuckles of children and the conversations and

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:44.059
laughter that seem to burble out of every street
corner, it pushes you in the direction of the

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:49.941
Pentamarket. That's when the smells of spices and
incense begin to come in waves as you follow the

00:29:49.941 --> 00:29:58.627
sauntering crowds, eventually that smell overcome
by the smell of cooked meat pies and roasted

00:29:58.627 --> 00:30:03.611
vegetables billowing from the various food carts
that line the corners of the streets before you.

00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:06.498
LIAM: I want to be at Ren Faire.

00:30:06.498 --> 00:30:08.627
LAURA: I know!

00:30:08.627 --> 00:30:15.366
MATT: The flickering of the wind is now this weird
syncopation that's blending with the sound of the

00:30:15.366 --> 00:30:20.358
distant drums and ocarinas and flutes that are
beginning to pipe into the strange din in the

00:30:20.358 --> 00:30:26.194
streets. You see a number of games of skill and
chance that have been set up in the distance too,

00:30:26.194 --> 00:30:31.204
amongst the crowds, as people begin to weave
through. To the left, you can see someone loudly

00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:37.890
proclaiming, "Want to play Trebuchet, anyone?" and
down the way another voice calling out, "King's

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:46.470
"Vault!" You can see more games in the distance
beyond there. More stages are set up with food and

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.819
it's a veritable smörgåsbord of celebration. What
do you guys want to do?

00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:51.861
TRAVIS: Trebuchet sounds pretty fucking sweet.

00:30:51.861 --> 00:30:54.148
TALIESIN: I think we're immediately heading to
Trebuchet.

00:30:54.148 --> 00:30:57.834
MARISHA: What do you mean? Is Trebuchet like a
trebuchet?

00:30:57.834 --> 00:30:59.716
TRAVIS: How the fuck do we know? We're going to
find out, though.

00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:03.685
TALIESIN: Do you fire it? Do you sit in it? I
don't know. There's only one way to find out.

00:31:06.565 --> 00:31:09.394
LIAM: I'm going to start walking towards the other
one, the king's thing.

00:31:09.394 --> 00:31:10.934
LAURA: All by yourself, Caleb?

00:31:10.958 --> 00:31:13.243
SAM: I'm going with Caleb. Want to come?

00:31:13.243 --> 00:31:17.585
LAURA: I want to get thrown in a trebuchet.

00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:18.356
SAM: Go with them, then.

00:31:18.356 --> 00:31:24.834
LAURA: Okay. Does it seem like there are more
guards around than usual? Are the guards relaxed?

00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:30.818
MATT: The guards are relaxed, but there's
definitely a large presence, and in fact, a number

00:31:30.818 --> 00:31:36.377
of the games are run by the guards. In fact,
Trebuchet, as you approach, you see two guards,

00:31:36.377 --> 00:31:42.689
male and female, that are both in the process of
lifting a three or four year old girl, and she has

00:31:42.689 --> 00:31:48.320
a sandbag in her hand. They're like, "One, two,
three!" and she throws it and it gets close, but

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.988
stops before the basket, but they cheer her on,
"Yay!" and set her down.

00:31:50.988 --> 00:31:52.652
MARISHA: Aww, I thought they were going to throw
her.

00:31:52.652 --> 00:31:54.183
LAURA: Like a wonder child!

00:31:54.183 --> 00:31:59.126
LIAM: Don't worry. If she falls, they kill her.

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:03.706
MATT: The kid runs off and grabs the bag and comes
back and they lift her again. They go, "One,

00:32:03.706 --> 00:32:07.485
"two--" and they give her even more of a swing so
she gets a little more distance. It hits the edge

00:32:07.485 --> 00:32:11.079
and then tips off to the side and they go, "Aww"
and the crowd who had gathered around "Awws" with

00:32:11.079 --> 00:32:16.918
her. The little girl smiles and gives them a hug
and then runs off. One of the guards turns as you

00:32:16.918 --> 00:32:20.552
guys begin to approach and shouts to the crowd,
"Trebuchet, anyone wish to play?"

00:32:20.552 --> 00:32:22.573
TRAVIS: Yes. Most definitely.

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:26.963
MATT: "Five copper for three throws."

00:32:26.963 --> 00:32:29.869
TRAVIS: Yeah. Here's ten copper for Molly and me.

00:32:29.869 --> 00:32:37.580
MATT: "Sipes?" The other guard goes, "All right,"
pulls up three of the sandbags and hands them to

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:43.365
you. "That basket there and that line there." You
see that they were in between for the kids' reach,

00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:48.688
but there's about a ten-foot distance of small,
thin carpet that's placed behind the line leading

00:32:48.688 --> 00:32:54.813
to this open wicker basket that's about a foot and
a half wide. You have to throw overhead, facing away.

00:32:54.813 --> 00:32:55.941
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:32:56.844 --> 00:32:59.253
SAM: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:32:59.397 --> 00:33:04.521
LAURA: Do we need to pick them up and do the thing
like you did with the child?

00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:07.711
MATT: "You are more than welcome to try. I'd love
to see that happen. That is not necessary."

00:33:07.711 --> 00:33:12.759
TRAVIS: No, it's all right. Let me try it on my
own first. For dignity's sake.

00:33:13.051 --> 00:33:18.495
MATT: As you stand there, you take the sandbag and
in a trebuchet-like motion, lob it overhead

00:33:18.495 --> 00:33:24.720
without quite looking, assuming the direction. Go
ahead and make a dexterity check with disadvantage please.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.672
TRAVIS: I didn't need that disadv-- That's a
natural one.

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:30.342
(laughter)

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.408
SAM: $100 for 826LA.

00:33:32.408 --> 00:33:36.698
MATT: You lob it and hear, (pained grunt) and
everybody goes "Oh!" and you turn around.

00:33:36.698 --> 00:33:40.466
TRAVIS: Sorry, friend. Yeah, that's a purple
heart, sorry man. Jeez.

00:33:40.466 --> 00:33:44.617
MATT: You turn around. You can see the mother of
the small kid that was first throwing, and she's

00:33:44.617 --> 00:33:47.569
rubbing the side of her face.

00:33:47.569 --> 00:33:49.870
LAURA: You hit a mother.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.582
TRAVIS: Find her a soothing-- something to take
the pain off.

00:33:52.582 --> 00:33:59.405
MATT: She goes, "Ah, it's fine." Looks up at you
and goes, "Come on." She grabs her kid's arm and

00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:01.331
they both leave deeper into the crowd.

00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:03.635
LAURA: You should have let me and Yasha pick you
up.

00:34:03.635 --> 00:34:08.865
TRAVIS: No. I've got this. Resituate. Grab a bit
of a glance. (grunts)

00:34:08.943 --> 00:34:10.333
MATT: All right, try again.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.327
TRAVIS: That's another natural one.

00:34:16.192 --> 00:34:17.896
LIAM: Cha-ching!

00:34:17.896 --> 00:34:20.593
MATT: As you, one, two--

00:34:20.593 --> 00:34:23.220
TRAVIS: This happened at Ren Fair before.

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:30.189
MATT: You go to heave the sack, and as it does, it
gets caught on part of your breastplate and as you

00:34:30.189 --> 00:34:37.600
pull upward there's a (ripping) as sand goes
scattering into the sky around, emptying the bag

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:44.932
and pouring over you into your eyes. (spitting)
Laughter starts to gather in the crowd around and

00:34:44.932 --> 00:34:47.544
some small clapping.

00:34:47.544 --> 00:34:49.278
MARISHA: Again, again!

00:34:49.278 --> 00:34:53.254
TRAVIS: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but
let's give it a try.

00:34:53.318 --> 00:34:56.877
LAURA: (gasps) Okay. Yasha, you get on one side.
I'll get on the other.

00:34:56.877 --> 00:34:58.786
ASHLEY: Okay. That's fine.

00:34:58.786 --> 00:35:00.507
MATT: "Well, you have one more throw."

00:35:00.507 --> 00:35:02.386
TRAVIS: That's what I mean. I got them helping
me.

00:35:02.386 --> 00:35:04.022
MATT: "Which one of you is taking the other
throw?"

00:35:04.022 --> 00:35:07.255
LAURA: Oh, no. We're going to pick Fjord up the
way that you did the little child.

00:35:07.255 --> 00:35:09.514
MATT: "Oh, perfect. There you go."

00:35:09.514 --> 00:35:12.679
TRAVIS: Two shit throws in a row. It can't get any
fucking worse.

00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:14.143
LIAM: Come on, one!

00:35:14.525 --> 00:35:15.728
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:35:15.728 --> 00:35:16.485
ASHLEY: No!

00:35:16.485 --> 00:35:17.642
LIAM: Yes! Yes!

00:35:19.472 --> 00:35:21.125
MATT: That's ridiculous!

00:35:21.658 --> 00:35:27.435
ASHLEY: Seriously?! Throw that away!

00:35:27.435 --> 00:35:30.075
LAURA: You need to put that shit in jail.

00:35:30.075 --> 00:35:33.333
TALIESIN: You shouldn't have hit that woman with a
sandbag.

00:35:33.333 --> 00:35:40.229
LIAM: That's all right. You got them out of the
way. When we fight a basilisk later, all those

00:35:40.229 --> 00:35:42.598
ones are gone.

00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:45.724
MATT: Jester, Yasha. How do you want to do this?

00:35:47.488 --> 00:35:48.798
LAURA: We throw Fjord.

00:35:48.798 --> 00:35:51.949
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't think we help him. We just
(whoosh).

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:58.091
MATT: They literally shot put Fjord about three or
four feet. (surprised grunt)

00:35:58.157 --> 00:35:59.896
ASHLEY: Did we get him in?

00:35:59.896 --> 00:36:05.912
MATT: No. He gets about four feet before he goes
face first into the carpet. The carpet balls up in

00:36:05.912 --> 00:36:09.481
front of him as he skids for another foot, foot
and a half, with his feet up in the air before

00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:16.832
they come to rest. There's a dust cloud. There's a
loud gathering of voices going, "Ooh" and then

00:36:16.832 --> 00:36:19.326
silent as the music plays in the distance.

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:25.212
TRAVIS: (coughing) I think that might have-- I'm
going to get a drink. You guys carry on.

00:36:25.212 --> 00:36:26.755
Ow, my pride.

00:36:26.755 --> 00:36:28.865
ASHLEY and LAURA: Molly!

00:36:29.016 --> 00:36:33.822
MATT: The female guard goes and straightens out
the carpet to get it right. "Five copper."

00:36:33.822 --> 00:36:35.572
TALIESIN: No, he paid already.

00:36:35.572 --> 00:36:37.899
MATT: "Oh that's right. Then, by all means."

00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:41.109
TALIESIN: It's a dexterity? With disadvantage.

00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:43.437
MATT: Because you're looking away. It's not a hard
DC but--

00:36:44.247 --> 00:36:45.345
TALIESIN: 19.

00:36:45.465 --> 00:36:53.328
MATT: 19? (whoosh) (thud) "Whoa!" The crowd begins
cheering. "Yeah!"

00:36:53.328 --> 00:36:55.196
LAURA: Yay Molly!

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.349
MATT: They hand you a second one.

00:37:00.434 --> 00:37:02.206
LAURA: Does he get a prize?

00:37:02.206 --> 00:37:03.513
MATT: "At the end."

00:37:03.513 --> 00:37:07.697
TALIESIN: I think I may have to-- I've spent my
luck. I think it may be off to you and then one for you.

00:37:07.802 --> 00:37:08.917
ASHLEY: Oh, okay.

00:37:08.917 --> 00:37:09.732
LAURA: Really?

00:37:09.732 --> 00:37:10.951
TALIESIN: Three throws. One each.

00:37:10.951 --> 00:37:12.473
LAURA: Okay!

00:37:12.473 --> 00:37:14.479
ASHLEY: By all means, Jester.

00:37:14.479 --> 00:37:15.927
SAM: Jester, use these.

00:37:15.927 --> 00:37:17.123
LAURA: No!

00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:23.444
Oh, no!

00:37:23.444 --> 00:37:26.408
TALIESIN: It's still not terrible.

00:37:26.408 --> 00:37:28.577
LAURA: I rolled two twos.

00:37:28.577 --> 00:37:30.911
TALIESIN: That's a six.

00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:38.690
MATT: Jester. You throw it with all your strength,
and it goes straight up. Hits you in the top of

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.812
the head and dangles off one of your horns.

00:37:41.812 --> 00:37:44.114
LAURA: Did it mess up my jewelry?

00:37:44.114 --> 00:37:45.880
ASHLEY: Here, hold on.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.847
TALIESIN: Wait. Right, let's just--

00:37:47.847 --> 00:37:49.575
ASHLEY: Don't let it snag the earrings.

00:37:49.575 --> 00:37:50.719
TALIESIN: It's out.

00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:52.737
LAURA: Thank you. Go Yasha!

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:54.761
MATT: All right.

00:37:57.222 --> 00:37:59.224
ASHLEY: Four.

00:37:59.224 --> 00:38:01.845
TRAVIS: We suck at this.

00:38:01.845 --> 00:38:05.351
ASHLEY: Just let me do it. I know I'll get it in.

00:38:05.351 --> 00:38:10.576
MATT: As it arcs, it lands. There's a little poof
of dust behind. It only gets about four feet from

00:38:10.576 --> 00:38:12.187
you, unfortunately.

00:38:12.187 --> 00:38:13.901
ASHLEY: It's like a weird shape, you know?

00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:15.857
LAURA: It changes in the air.

00:38:15.857 --> 00:38:18.952
TALIESIN: I hardly know, but I've thrown a baby
before. Odd.

00:38:18.952 --> 00:38:23.782
MATT: "However, we do have one successful in!" and
they reach over into a satchel on the side and

00:38:23.782 --> 00:38:26.783
pull out-- "A fresh strawberry for the victor."

00:38:26.783 --> 00:38:29.271
LAURA: That's it? A strawberry?

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.951
TRAVIS: Is it red?

00:38:30.951 --> 00:38:35.756
MATT: It's actually pretty tasty. Fresh, sweet.
It's delicious.

00:38:35.756 --> 00:38:38.324
TALIESIN: Mmm. Mm-hmm.

00:38:38.324 --> 00:38:40.262
TRAVIS: How much for a strawberry?

00:38:40.262 --> 00:38:43.508
MATT: "Oh, we don't sell the strawberries. You can
buy them further in. Here, you pay for the

00:38:43.508 --> 00:38:47.750
"prestige of a victory and a strawberry. If you get
all three, you get a candied apple."

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.318
LAURA: (gasps)

00:38:51.588 --> 00:38:54.267
TALIESIN: (muffled) Tastes better with the
victory.

00:38:56.445 --> 00:39:00.059
TRAVIS: All right, what was the other game? Forget
this.

00:39:00.178 --> 00:39:02.176
LAURA: Caleb and Nott are already there.

00:39:02.176 --> 00:39:05.506
MATT: While this was transpiring, you guys go to
catch up while Caleb and Nott have approached the

00:39:05.506 --> 00:39:10.048
young half-elven woman who is shouting, "King's
Vault!" As you approach, you see she has her hair

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:15.614
tied back, and she's barking with this utmost
confidence. "King's Vault! Come play! Anyone, come

00:39:15.614 --> 00:39:18.329
"to the front! Show us your majesty of attention!"

00:39:18.329 --> 00:39:21.142
LIAM: Yeah, what sort of game is it that you are
running?

00:39:21.142 --> 00:39:26.719
MATT: "Well, you place either a silver or a gold
piece up and I will--" and she pulls up three

00:39:26.778 --> 00:39:31.796
silver cups. "I will place it underneath one of
these. Mix it around. Pay attention. Guess the

00:39:31.796 --> 00:39:36.855
"right one. Get your coin back plus one. Get it
wrong, coin stays with me. Simple game."

00:39:36.855 --> 00:39:42.005
LIAM: Well, I just so happen to have three silver
on me. It takes one silver to play?

00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:44.144
MATT: "Yes. At least."

00:39:44.144 --> 00:39:50.648
LIAM: At least. Well, I am feeling lucky today and
always. Here it is.

00:39:50.648 --> 00:39:54.204
MATT: "Onto the table." She takes the center cup
(click). Cup's over it.

00:39:54.204 --> 00:40:00.196
SAM: I'm looking. I'm going to hold my wire up to
my mouth.

00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:03.579
MATT: All righty. That being the case, I would
like you both to roll a perception check.

00:40:03.579 --> 00:40:06.252
LIAM: Does my Keen Mind help me at all in this
situation?

00:40:06.252 --> 00:40:08.394
MATT: Strangely, it does not.

00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:12.154
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:40:12.154 --> 00:40:15.071
(cheering)

00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:16.157
SAM: Four.

00:40:17.227 --> 00:40:24.649
MATT: As soon as she finishes the rotation, she
stops and goes, "Very well," and you, has to be

00:40:24.751 --> 00:40:27.905
the right one. Has to be the center.

00:40:27.905 --> 00:40:29.569
LIAM: I will go with the center one.

00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:30.891
SAM: It's the one on the right!

00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:32.560
LIAM: I think it is this one right here.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.639
SAM: The right one. No! You're getting the wrong
one! The right one!

00:40:36.639 --> 00:40:40.957
LIAM: I will go with the middle one. I think it's
probably the correct place.

00:40:40.957 --> 00:40:46.175
MATT: She tips the cup. Indeed the silver is
there. "Congratulations! With that, your earnings

00:40:46.175 --> 00:40:48.973
"doubled," and gives you a secondary silver.

00:40:48.973 --> 00:40:52.415
LIAM: Two silver. Well, you know, I just wanted to
play the game. I'm not trying to make any money.

00:40:52.415 --> 00:40:54.281
Did you want to do anything here?

00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:55.911
SAM: I'd like to compete please.

00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:59.274
LIAM: I give her my two silver. Do me proud.

00:40:59.274 --> 00:41:01.329
SAM: Yes please.

00:41:01.329 --> 00:41:02.643
MATT: "A silver?"

00:41:02.643 --> 00:41:03.972
SAM: Yeah, here.

00:41:03.972 --> 00:41:07.631
MATT: "Of course." Coin goes down. Cups over it.
Now there's a small crowd gathering. Now people

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:11.924
are starting to watch. There was a victory
apparently, and some cheers.

00:41:11.924 --> 00:41:15.434
LIAM: I am going to back up like five or six steps
and also do the same thing Nott did.

00:41:15.434 --> 00:41:20.255
MATT: She begins shifting and shifting and
shifting and shifting. Eyes focused on you.

00:41:20.255 --> 00:41:27.731
Starting to look strangely at you. "Very well.
Choose." Now go ahead and roll a perception check.

00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:30.267
SAM: That's a natural one.

00:41:30.267 --> 00:41:32.901
(cheering)

00:41:34.621 --> 00:41:38.887
MATT: You were paying attention. All of a sudden,
you lost it. Looking up at her eyes, you were so

00:41:38.887 --> 00:41:46.437
caught off guard by her staring at your fairly
well-concealed goblin visage, but seemingly not

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:51.000
enough, as she has a curious raised eyebrow. That
spooks you for a second. You go "Oh, shit!" You

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.542
lost track of the cups.

00:41:52.542 --> 00:41:54.174
LIAM: I got a total of 20.

00:41:54.174 --> 00:41:57.501
MATT: Total of 20. On the perception? Okay. "What
are you going to pick?"

00:41:57.501 --> 00:42:03.054
SAM: I will choose-- eenie, meenie, miney.

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:06.968
LIAM: Do I get a chance to whisper to her what I
saw? Because I want to do the same thing.

00:42:06.968 --> 00:42:08.838
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

00:42:08.838 --> 00:42:10.200
LIAM: Yeah okay.

00:42:11.483 --> 00:42:15.150
Oh, that's not so good. That is a six.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:21.152
MATT: As you begin to pull your hands up and
mutter your incantations, she goes, "Ahem. No

00:42:21.152 --> 00:42:22.611
"funny business."

00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:24.595
LIAM: Oh, I am a funny guy.

00:42:24.595 --> 00:42:28.933
MATT: "I could tell. Ha ha. Now?"

00:42:28.933 --> 00:42:32.028
SAM: I'm going to pick the one on-- the middle.

00:42:32.028 --> 00:42:37.848
MATT: "The middle." She pulls the cup back. Empty.
"Aw. A good try." Scoops the coin off the table.

00:42:37.848 --> 00:42:44.531
SAM: I failed you, Caleb! I'm so sorry. I took
your silver, and I let it go. I'm sorry.

00:42:44.531 --> 00:42:48.857
LIAM: Yeah, but you know also, the other day, you
gave me 200 gold, so it's not really a problem.

00:42:48.857 --> 00:42:51.981
SAM: I know, but it's the principle.

00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:55.754
MATT: "Well if you have 200 gold, you are more
than welcome to place a gold piece up here as well."

00:42:55.831 --> 00:42:57.674
SAM: We're okay. Thank you.

00:42:57.674 --> 00:42:59.251
MATT: "Very well."

00:42:59.251 --> 00:43:01.476
LIAM: I give her the stink-eye as we walk away.

00:43:02.076 --> 00:43:04.436
MATT: "Take care of your green friend there."

00:43:05.252 --> 00:43:06.972
LIAM: I intensify the stink-eye.

00:43:09.258 --> 00:43:13.357
MATT: At this point, you guys turn around and you
see the rest of your party has caught up to you.

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:15.522
Fjord covered in dry dust.

00:43:16.084 --> 00:43:18.085
TALIESIN: I won a strawberry.

00:43:18.875 --> 00:43:20.583
MARISHA: Fjord can't throw.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.629
LIAM: Did you have a different kind of dream?

00:43:23.629 --> 00:43:25.365
TRAVIS: N-- No.

00:43:25.668 --> 00:43:27.310
LIAM: Beat again.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.815
SAM: He won a silver, but I lost it.

00:43:30.932 --> 00:43:32.696
ASHLEY: What game did you play?

00:43:32.696 --> 00:43:34.781
LIAM: It was called King's Crown.

00:43:34.781 --> 00:43:35.958
SAM: King's Vault.

00:43:35.958 --> 00:43:37.435
LIAM: That's what I said.

00:43:37.435 --> 00:43:40.131
LAURA: Oh, the one where they spin it around and
you see which cup it is.

00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:42.273
LIAM: She was very quick, yeah.

00:43:42.273 --> 00:43:45.176
ASHLEY: I wonder if there are any more games.

00:43:45.176 --> 00:43:52.062
MATT: You glance around, keeping an eye open as
you guys continue. You've now hit the deeper edge

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:57.459
of the Pentamarket. The crowds around you are
fairly dense at this point. There are people

00:43:57.459 --> 00:44:04.115
laughing and talking. They're carrying various
baked goods that are fresh out of the nearby carts

00:44:04.115 --> 00:44:09.857
or oven. The smell creeps into your senses and
takes over from that point. Children run past and

00:44:09.857 --> 00:44:14.355
bump you in the side. Some are holding two ends of
a streamer, and the streamers continue past and

00:44:14.355 --> 00:44:22.259
flap around, hitting people. It's adorable and
delightfully intense. The guard presence is very

00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:26.898
much felt here, but everyone is in high spirits.
You get the sense that everyone has been waiting

00:44:26.898 --> 00:44:32.979
to get to this festival, to this moment here. It's
a much different atmosphere than the gala you had

00:44:32.979 --> 00:44:35.975
seen a week before in the Tri-Spires.

00:44:35.975 --> 00:44:38.200
TRAVIS: They needed this catharsis, it feels
like.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.992
TALIESIN Quite a party.

00:44:39.992 --> 00:44:44.238
MARISHA: I want to find the most ridiculous mead
out there.

00:44:44.238 --> 00:44:48.138
MATT: Oh, there are quite a few mead stands, so
it's easy enough for you. Make an investigation check.

00:44:48.257 --> 00:44:49.354
TRAVIS: Meat or mead?

00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:50.266
MARISHA: Mead.

00:44:50.266 --> 00:44:52.134
LAURA: I want to find the candied apples.

00:44:54.235 --> 00:44:55.763
MARISHA: 17.

00:44:55.763 --> 00:45:00.246
MATT: Very easy to find through a couple of
sleight questions to some of the noncompetitive

00:45:00.246 --> 00:45:09.305
barkers. You manage to find a small meadery stand
that's near the outskirts of one of the large

00:45:09.305 --> 00:45:15.558
arena structures, that you haven't seen used since
you arrived in this city. As you approach, the

00:45:15.558 --> 00:45:21.977
older guy there, with this curled and unkempt
chin-beard that looks like part of it isn't

00:45:21.977 --> 00:45:29.289
growing on the right side. You approach and he has
all this thick, dark jugs of mead, and he is like,

00:45:29.289 --> 00:45:31.372
"Hey, you want some mead?"

00:45:31.372 --> 00:45:33.895
MARISHA: Yeah, do you have mead that doesn't taste
like piss?

00:45:33.895 --> 00:45:37.010
MATT: "I have mead that'll get you fucked up."

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:38.448
MARISHA: That'll do.

00:45:38.448 --> 00:45:40.146
MATT: "Might taste like piss still."

00:45:40.146 --> 00:45:41.668
SAM: He did not answer your question.

00:45:42.413 --> 00:45:44.206
LIAM: That'll do, pig.

00:45:44.206 --> 00:45:46.206
MARISHA: What's your highest proof mead?

00:45:49.064 --> 00:45:55.679
MATT: He picks up one jug (sniffs). "That one" and
hold it out for you to smell. It's pretty strong.

00:45:55.679 --> 00:46:01.321
It smells slightly acrid, but not in a bad way.
Just in a strong mead way.

00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:02.800
TRAVIS: Slightly vinegar.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.558
MARISHA: Still smells like piss, man.

00:46:04.558 --> 00:46:08.843
MATT: "Welp, depends what you want. Do you want
strong or do you want tasty? You got to pick."

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.395
MARISHA: Strong.

00:46:11.395 --> 00:46:13.267
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, good choice.

00:46:13.267 --> 00:46:18.760
MATT: "That'll be a nice, fair filled cup. For a
silver."

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.460
TALIESIN: This about when I run up: What'd you
get?

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.535
MARISHA: Barbarian pee, but it's good.

00:46:26.535 --> 00:46:28.303
TALIESIN: What are the options?

00:46:28.303 --> 00:46:35.193
MATT: He pulls up three jugs. He says, "This end,
tasty. This end, fuck you up. This one, little bit

00:46:35.193 --> 00:46:37.115
"of A, little bit of B."

00:46:37.115 --> 00:46:39.118
TALIESIN: I'll take whatever's most expensive.

00:46:39.118 --> 00:46:45.583
MATT: Grabs the same stuff that Beau got, the
heavier, thick stuff. Pours, gives you a cup full

00:46:45.583 --> 00:46:48.445
of it. "That'll be a silver piece."

00:46:48.445 --> 00:46:49.957
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

00:46:49.957 --> 00:46:55.870
MATT: Takes it. It's strong, the aftertaste isn't
too bad. It's the initial, weird, sour, vinegary,

00:46:55.870 --> 00:47:03.482
impact, but then the sweetness comes in afterward.
It sets well, and it's <i>strong</i>. As you guys are

00:47:03.482 --> 00:47:08.229
walking around and keeping an eye, you do see
there is another stand that has an elevated

00:47:08.229 --> 00:47:16.102
platform called Titan's Grasp. There are four
soldiers of the Righteous Brand, the Empire

00:47:16.102 --> 00:47:21.448
Military, that are currently manning it. They're
wearing their plate mail of silver and

00:47:21.448 --> 00:47:29.594
dark-crimson design. A large, cubed stone, two
feet by two feet, is set on top of this platform

00:47:29.594 --> 00:47:35.292
with a metal bar that is wedged beneath it, that
it's leaning against. The metal bar has a

00:47:35.292 --> 00:47:42.448
cylindrical center point, like a fulcrum. There is
a large hammer, that one of them is currently

00:47:42.448 --> 00:47:50.065
holding to the side. As you begin to approach, you
see one guy there, who's currently spitting into

00:47:50.065 --> 00:47:55.959
his hands, grabs the hammer (grunts). As he hits
the metal bar, the stone goes (slight scraping)

00:47:55.959 --> 00:48:01.572
barely shifts. He sets down the hammer and
everyone's like: "Yay" and he goes, "I moved it!"

00:48:01.572 --> 00:48:03.885
Steps down off the platform.

00:48:03.885 --> 00:48:05.975
TRAVIS: They're celebrating anything these days.

00:48:05.975 --> 00:48:07.832
LAURA: Yasha!

00:48:07.832 --> 00:48:10.061
ASHLEY and LAURA: We should go play this game.

00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:15.671
ASHLEY: I was really looking forward to looking
for ridiculous meats. Not meads, but maybe we can--

00:48:15.735 --> 00:48:17.377
MARISHA: Oh, meat sounds great too.

00:48:17.377 --> 00:48:18.934
TRAVIS: Yeah, the day is young.

00:48:18.934 --> 00:48:20.580
ASHLEY: Let's go play this game.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.105
TRAVIS: Not play, crush this game.

00:48:24.105 --> 00:48:26.447
LAURA: We get a candied apple, okay?

00:48:26.447 --> 00:48:33.736
MATT: You approach the four soldiers that are up
there. One of them comes up to you, the one who

00:48:33.736 --> 00:48:38.174
has the hammer at his side after retrieving it
from the last person, goes, "Hey all right, are

00:48:38.174 --> 00:48:40.944
"you willing to play some Titan's Grasp, eh?"

00:48:40.944 --> 00:48:42.480
ASHLEY and LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.227
MATT: "All right, it's five silver an entry."

00:48:45.227 --> 00:48:46.672
LAURA: Five silver.

00:48:46.672 --> 00:48:48.026
ASHLEY What's the prize?

00:48:48.026 --> 00:48:52.222
MATT: "Single swing, but winner gets the current
pot. Which stands at--" and he turns to one of the

00:48:52.222 --> 00:48:58.719
other guards who goes through a small bag and
goes, "That's going to run about 43 gold."

00:48:58.719 --> 00:49:00.686
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:49:00.686 --> 00:49:02.629
LAURA: Yeah!

00:49:02.629 --> 00:49:06.564
ASHLEY: I'll give five gold. Five silver, I mean.
I'm so sorry.

00:49:06.564 --> 00:49:08.644
MATT: "All right, one swing. You?"

00:49:08.644 --> 00:49:10.136
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes!

00:49:10.136 --> 00:49:11.519
MATT: "One swing for you."

00:49:11.586 --> 00:49:12.725
TRAVIS: Two swings.

00:49:12.725 --> 00:49:14.768
ASHLEY: Two swings? Shit, okay.

00:49:14.768 --> 00:49:19.321
MATT: "Take as many as you want. No one's turned
it over this morning yet."

00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:21.205
ASHLEY: All right.

00:49:21.205 --> 00:49:22.972
TALIESIN: Can you rage at this thing when you--

00:49:22.972 --> 00:49:24.415
ASHLEY: That's what I was going to try.

00:49:24.415 --> 00:49:26.480
LAURA: Nice.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.056
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: When in doubt.

00:49:29.056 --> 00:49:30.862
MATT: "Who's going first?"

00:49:30.862 --> 00:49:32.509
LAURA: Yasha can go first.

00:49:32.582 --> 00:49:34.773
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll go first.

00:49:34.773 --> 00:49:39.169
LAURA: I'm going to wait to give him my money
because I have a feeling Yasha might win. I'm

00:49:39.169 --> 00:49:40.591
going to wait.

00:49:40.591 --> 00:49:45.745
MATT: "Oh, I like that. Your friend's got
confidence in you. All right, big missy." Hands

00:49:45.745 --> 00:49:48.308
you the heavy hammer. It's not too heavy in your
grasp.

00:49:48.308 --> 00:49:49.711
TRAVIS: Come on, Yasha!

00:49:49.711 --> 00:49:53.732
MATT: It's not very well balanced either. It's not
a battle-ready hammer, it's designed for this type

00:49:53.732 --> 00:49:59.222
of a show experience. You get the sense this
hammer would not be the most effective for this.

00:49:59.222 --> 00:50:04.248
It might be intentional. It's your turn, people
start gathering. You're up on an elevated two foot

00:50:04.248 --> 00:50:08.934
platform there. They have the metal bar fulcrum,
all set beneath the stone. Hammer's in your hands,

00:50:08.934 --> 00:50:10.425
what do you do?

00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:18.638
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to rage. Ah! Just
strength?

00:50:18.638 --> 00:50:23.699
MATT: This is a strength check, yeah. You have
advantage while you're raging. Roll twice, take

00:50:23.699 --> 00:50:26.766
the higher, and add your strength modifier.

00:50:27.347 --> 00:50:30.946
ASHLEY: Oof. Okay, 17.

00:50:30.946 --> 00:50:38.056
MATT: 17. (grunts) (ringing impact) You hit the
metal bar, the stone (scraping) falls back into

00:50:38.056 --> 00:50:40.633
rest. It's a heavy stone.

00:50:40.633 --> 00:50:43.192
LAURA: What are we trying to do here?

00:50:43.192 --> 00:50:47.804
MATT: The stone is resting on the lower part and
there is a fulcrum round centerpiece to it. You're

00:50:47.804 --> 00:50:52.875
trying to hit on this end to push the stone to
roll over. It moved slightly and falls back into

00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:56.456
place. "Good try! That was very strong there,
lass. Don't worry."

00:50:56.456 --> 00:50:58.417
ASHLEY: Well, I have another go.

00:50:58.417 --> 00:50:59.414
MATT: "Well pay another."

00:50:59.414 --> 00:51:00.927
ASHLEY: I did. I gave you ten.

00:51:00.927 --> 00:51:04.921
MATT: "Oh you did? Tell me this when you're
counting this, bud. Go ahead, second swing."

00:51:04.921 --> 00:51:08.108
TALIESIN: You get another swing, yeah.

00:51:08.108 --> 00:51:10.488
MATT: You get advantage while raging, so--

00:51:11.386 --> 00:51:12.714
ASHLEY: 24.

00:51:12.714 --> 00:51:14.721
TRAVIS and LAURA: Ooh!

00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:20.420
MATT: You pull back, and the one guy is looking
over to one of the mates on the side and starts

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:27.472
laughing. Suddenly (impact) (scraping) (larger
impact). The stone shifts, slams on to the other

00:51:27.472 --> 00:51:30.625
side. All four of them go (gasp).

00:51:32.985 --> 00:51:35.186
(cheering)

00:51:35.285 --> 00:51:36.370
LAURA: Yasha!

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:40.351
MATT: Now suddenly the crowd around, that you
didn't notice gathering, start cheering: "Yay!"

00:51:40.351 --> 00:51:44.503
Looks over to the one guard who had the pouch,
"Okay then, congratulations."

00:51:44.503 --> 00:51:45.973
ASHLEY: Thank you.

00:51:45.973 --> 00:51:47.154
MATT: Hands it over.

00:51:47.154 --> 00:51:48.399
ASHLEY: Can I count it?

00:51:48.399 --> 00:51:52.708
MATT: Yeah go for it. You take a moment to count
through, while staring at him. It comes out to

00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:59.817
roughly about 43 gold worth of silver, including
the ten silver that you put into it. Or not

00:51:59.817 --> 00:52:04.642
including the ten silver, so in addition to that.
It would be 44 gold worth but it's mostly silver pieces.

00:52:04.926 --> 00:52:06.234
ASHLEY: Oh shit, how much--

00:52:06.234 --> 00:52:11.361
LIAM: About seven feet away, out of habit, Caleb
just went: (counting).

00:52:13.033 --> 00:52:15.307
LAURA: That will buy us so many candied apples.

00:52:15.307 --> 00:52:22.798
MATT: All the guards go over and shift the stone
back over onto the fulcrum. They pull in and bring

00:52:22.798 --> 00:52:26.760
out about a gold piece each, to throw five gold
back into the pot. They go, "All right, back up.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.652
"Who wants in?"

00:52:28.652 --> 00:52:30.550
ASHLEY: She's next.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.868
LAURA: Oh, well all right. Five gold is-- all
right.

00:52:33.868 --> 00:52:37.128
TRAVIS: I'll toss in a gold piece just to make it
interesting.

00:52:37.128 --> 00:52:38.902
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I'll do that when I see you
going in.

00:52:38.902 --> 00:52:40.876
LAURA: What!? You guys.

00:52:40.876 --> 00:52:42.435
MATT: The guards are going, "Wait, into the--"

00:52:42.435 --> 00:52:44.061
LAURA: You're going to play, right?

00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:45.533
TRAVIS: For the game, right?

00:52:45.533 --> 00:52:47.346
SAM: I will take that bet. I'll bet against her.

00:52:47.346 --> 00:52:49.052
LAURA: What?

00:52:49.052 --> 00:52:50.600
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.020
SAM: I got one gold that says she cannot do this.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.268
MARISHA: I'm the booker, so you pay me.

00:52:56.268 --> 00:52:59.393
SAM: I don't think that's how that works.

00:53:00.583 --> 00:53:02.151
LAURA: I roll for strength check?

00:53:02.151 --> 00:53:03.820
MATT: Yup, roll a strength check, add your
strength modifier.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.479
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:53:06.654 --> 00:53:10.162
(cheering)

00:53:10.162 --> 00:53:17.662
MATT: (resounding impact) As you slam down again,
the stone goes (impact). It rolls over a second time.

00:53:17.662 --> 00:53:20.080
TRAVIS: Two in a row.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:24.869
MATT: Seemingly, the fulcrum set after you knocked
it over prepared her for a better slam. As it

00:53:24.869 --> 00:53:31.730
hits, the four soldiers of the Righteous Brand
look at each other, "We're going to take a break

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:37.988
"here for a second. Return here in about 30
minutes." They hand the money over to you get

00:53:37.988 --> 00:53:39.914
five, six gold.

00:53:39.914 --> 00:53:41.488
LAURA: Seven gold.

00:53:41.488 --> 00:53:43.104
TRAVIS: Nott.

00:53:43.104 --> 00:53:46.786
SAM: Here's one gold. I just wanted to fire her
up.

00:53:46.786 --> 00:53:50.104
LAURA: Thanks, Nott. It worked.

00:53:50.104 --> 00:53:51.441
SAM: I know.

00:53:51.441 --> 00:53:55.663
MATT: They're going to inspect the hammer,
inspecting the fulcrum, inspecting the stone, and

00:53:55.663 --> 00:53:59.002
they're basically in the process of wondering if
they had somehow been cheated out of this. They

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.335
can't find anything.

00:54:00.335 --> 00:54:02.037
LAURA: I skip away.

00:54:02.037 --> 00:54:08.105
MATT: At this point now, the smell of warm,
candied fruit begins to waft past you. You glance

00:54:08.105 --> 00:54:11.354
over and can see there is a large cart that is
selling all sort of sweet fruit that have been

00:54:11.407 --> 00:54:16.593
coated in sugar. Some have a sticky syrup
exterior, and there are candied apples available

00:54:16.593 --> 00:54:20.679
for purchase. Depends on how much you guys want to
purchase, if any.

00:54:20.679 --> 00:54:24.798
ASHLEY: I would very much-- I have never had a
candied apple before.

00:54:24.798 --> 00:54:27.524
LAURA: You have to try them. They're so good!

00:54:27.524 --> 00:54:33.972
SAM: You've never had a candied apple before? It
seems so basic. It's honey and an apple.

00:54:33.972 --> 00:54:42.677
LAURA: Well, the candied apples are hard, right?
The caramel apples are softer. Do you have caramel apples?

00:54:43.148 --> 00:54:50.077
MATT: You can see the older woman who's there, who
a little bit portly with a big smile, rosy cheeks,

00:54:50.077 --> 00:54:54.521
pulls from behind the counter-- "They're still
cooling off." You can see a small tray that has

00:54:54.595 --> 00:54:59.176
about six caramel covered apples that you see are
still gleaming in the little bit of light that's

00:54:59.176 --> 00:55:00.721
coming from the cloudy sky.

00:55:00.721 --> 00:55:02.437
LAURA: Yes. That's what I wanted!

00:55:02.437 --> 00:55:05.519
LIAM: I haven't had one of those in such a long
time.

00:55:05.519 --> 00:55:08.008
LAURA: I'm going to buy one for all of us.

00:55:08.008 --> 00:55:09.419
MATT: "All right, that's going to be--"

00:55:09.419 --> 00:55:11.560
SAM: We have to share one?

00:55:12.838 --> 00:55:16.526
MATT: "Two copper each. For seven, that'll put you
at 14 copper."

00:55:16.526 --> 00:55:19.847
LAURA: Okay. How much does that add up to in
silver?

00:55:19.847 --> 00:55:21.562
TALIESIN: One silver, four copper.

00:55:21.562 --> 00:55:24.554
LAURA: Okay. I pass it over.

00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:30.251
MATT: "There's six caramel apples here, and you
have seven with you."

00:55:30.251 --> 00:55:33.136
TRAVIS: It's okay. No, it gets stuck in your
teeth.

00:55:33.136 --> 00:55:35.488
ASHLEY: I'll take the candy, because I've never
had it.

00:55:35.488 --> 00:55:40.431
MATT: "Candy apple, all right, for you and the six
for you. (shouting) All out of caramel apples for

00:55:40.431 --> 00:55:43.283
"the time being, but return here in an hour!"

00:55:43.283 --> 00:55:47.224
LAURA: An hour! You have to wait because we got
all of them!

00:55:47.224 --> 00:55:49.403
(laughter)

00:55:49.403 --> 00:55:52.126
MATT: There's this little girl across the way
who's like--

00:55:53.864 --> 00:55:57.003
LAURA: Aw. I cut a little slice off and give her
one little slice.

00:55:57.118 --> 00:56:00.461
MATT: You approach, and she gets scared. As you
get closer you can see she looks a little

00:56:00.461 --> 00:56:08.214
disheveled. Probably one of the less well-off
people of the city of Zadash. You don't see a

00:56:08.214 --> 00:56:10.732
parental figure in the near vicinity.

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:23.923
LAURA: Where's your mama? Do you have a mama? Is
she around?

00:56:24.283 --> 00:56:25.581
MATT: Just runs off.

00:56:25.581 --> 00:56:28.909
LAURA: Oh no, I was going to give you more, but
okay. Goodbye.

00:56:28.909 --> 00:56:31.161
SAM: Should we go after her? I can hunt her down.

00:56:31.161 --> 00:56:33.838
LAURA: No.

00:56:33.838 --> 00:56:37.288
LIAM: While I start to enjoy my apple, I would
like to look around and see if there are any book

00:56:37.288 --> 00:56:40.047
stalls or book barrels.

00:56:40.047 --> 00:56:42.245
SAM: Those festive book stalls.

00:56:42.245 --> 00:56:45.297
TALIESIN: A barrel of books!

00:56:45.297 --> 00:56:47.543
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

00:56:47.543 --> 00:56:51.224
SAM: Candied books, candied books!

00:56:51.476 --> 00:56:54.323
TRAVIS: The little girl disappeared into the
crowd, or did she join a bunch of other kids?

00:56:54.323 --> 00:56:55.315
MATT: She disappeared into the crowd.

00:56:55.315 --> 00:56:56.218
LIAM: Perception, you said?

00:56:56.218 --> 00:57:00.013
SAM: Throw a dart. Win a book.

00:57:00.013 --> 00:57:00.725
LIAM: 15.

00:57:00.725 --> 00:57:07.169
MATT: It does not appear that there is a strong
presence of tome and/or book retailers as part of

00:57:07.169 --> 00:57:08.179
the celebration, unfortunately.

00:57:08.179 --> 00:57:13.423
LIAM: Okay, while I was looking round, is there
anything besides games and food?

00:57:13.423 --> 00:57:23.862
MATT: There's games. There's food. There are
celebratory tapestries in the colors of autumn.

00:57:23.862 --> 00:57:32.460
You see small, pressed crests of the Empire that
are used to either hang over your door as a good

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:39.179
luck charm or to use as decor on the interior. A
lot of it's knick-knacks and general collectibles.

00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:45.889
Most everyone out here, it's a craft fair on top
of being a celebratory-- There's a bunch of random

00:57:45.889 --> 00:57:49.968
odds and ends that people collect or purchase to
add to their home interior.

00:57:49.968 --> 00:57:55.338
LIAM: Huge long shot probably a no, but do I also
see anything about the Cobalt Soul here?

00:57:55.338 --> 00:58:03.702
MATT: Glancing about, you do see the occasional
person of the Cobalt Soul robes, but they're not

00:58:03.702 --> 00:58:05.895
selling anything here.

00:58:05.895 --> 00:58:10.613
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up behind: Caleb, have
you run Detect Magic on any of this?

00:58:10.613 --> 00:58:16.788
LIAM: Well, you know, I tried to do a little stuff
on the sly a little while ago and didn't work out so well.

00:58:16.819 --> 00:58:21.102
TALIESIN: Just, there's so much. I figure
something's got to be interesting.

00:58:21.644 --> 00:58:26.240
LIAM: Well, if you can keep eyes off of me for a
moment, I can do that if you like.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.957
TALIESIN: I can absolutely do that. I'm going to
run towards the tapestry booth.

00:58:28.957 --> 00:58:30.582
MATT: Okay.

00:58:30.582 --> 00:58:31.942
(laughter)

00:58:31.942 --> 00:58:36.962
MATT: There you can see, it's a long, thin cart
that's mainly things on display. It looks like

00:58:36.962 --> 00:58:44.184
it's two wooden dowel rods at each side of this
booth, that all push together at the center. All

00:58:44.199 --> 00:58:48.569
the tapestries are hung over the side on display
for the front end. There's three individuals that

00:58:48.569 --> 00:58:52.209
are manning this booth. There isn't a whole lot of
transaction going on there. It's a little more of

00:58:52.209 --> 00:58:56.987
a specialty item in the sense that not everyone
needs to fill their place with tapestries. They're on display.

00:58:58.325 --> 00:59:02.080
TALIESIN: I'm seeing if there's anything deeply
gaudy.

00:59:02.106 --> 00:59:08.767
MATT: Yes, actually. There is one that is an
insignia or an interpretation of the symbol of the

00:59:08.767 --> 00:59:17.628
Platinum Dragon. It is silver threads among a
standard sky-blue coloring. There's several

00:59:17.628 --> 00:59:22.510
different dragon heads that are woven into the
pattern. There's almost an embroidery. For as much

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:28.011
as you've known about the Platinum Dragon and the
religion, it's surprisingly gaudy.

00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:30.966
LIAM: I'm trailing about 40 feet behind Molly.

00:59:30.966 --> 00:59:32.993
TALIESIN: That's beautiful. How much is that,
then?

00:59:32.993 --> 00:59:39.822
MATT: One of the people running the booth,
quickly, as you see a mid-30s, half-elf man with a

00:59:39.822 --> 00:59:46.238
bit of chin scruff and very short hair, leans
around the corner and goes, "Oh, for the Platinum

00:59:46.238 --> 00:59:52.899
"Dragon. This one was handcrafted by me and my
mate, over the period of about two months. Hand

00:59:52.899 --> 00:59:58.172
"embroidered. Very difficult. Very exquisite. For
the entire piece, the central piece you're

00:59:58.172 --> 01:00:04.667
"inquiring about, that'll run you about ten gold
pieces. We have smaller, almost doily-sized

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.257
"renditions of it back here."

01:00:06.257 --> 01:00:09.074
TALIESIN: How big is this piece, out of
curiosity?

01:00:09.074 --> 01:00:12.813
MATT: He takes the back and unfolds it entirely
but can't quite get the full arm length to get up

01:00:12.813 --> 01:00:19.407
there. He's like, "This one's about six and a
half, seven feet from top to bottom. Can be used

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:22.730
"as a rug, should you be so inclined and you aren't
quite a fan of the Platinum Dragon and want him

01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:23.711
"beneath your feet--"

01:00:23.711 --> 01:00:27.752
TALIESIN: It's purchased. Ten gold? My god.

01:00:27.752 --> 01:00:32.389
MATT: "Right away!" He takes it, begins folding it
up with one of his other compatriots. They take

01:00:32.389 --> 01:00:35.307
the twine and manage to fasten it in three
places.

01:00:35.307 --> 01:00:39.786
TALIESIN: Bless you, master craftsmen! My god. It
is such a rendition of the Platinum Dragon that

01:00:39.786 --> 01:00:44.610
I've never seen before. I clutch at my Platinum
Dragon brooch. It's beautiful.

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:50.139
MATT: He says, "We're happy to bring joy to you
and the house of your great deity." They hand you

01:00:50.139 --> 01:00:54.245
this relatively massive tapestry that's almost
seven feet end to end.

01:00:54.245 --> 01:01:01.247
TALIESIN: Oh, I have fucking plans, people! Swing
it over my shoulder, and I'll be walking around

01:01:01.247 --> 01:01:04.130
like a pike.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:10.034
MATT: As this is happening, you see that there are
two other games. You're now seeing the central

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:16.389
space here. You've walked past this structure.
It's this small, forum-like circular stone

01:01:16.389 --> 01:01:22.500
building that's been emptied and closed. Now
there's crowds walking in and out the front

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:29.282
doorway, and around it are where a lot of these
games are set up. You do see one that has a big

01:01:29.282 --> 01:01:35.456
banner that says Eagle Shot. There is one large,
central platform where it looks like this is where

01:01:35.456 --> 01:01:42.347
a lot of public presentations are given here in
the Pentamarket. It's currently set up with a

01:01:42.347 --> 01:01:47.374
central table and a number of members of the
Righteous Brand, as well as one that is a <i>very</i>

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:55.180
well-adorned human male with brown hair that's
pulled up into a topknot. He has a big, thick

01:01:55.180 --> 01:02:01.944
beard. Looks like a handsome fellow and he's
currently barking out something about the

01:02:01.944 --> 01:02:07.330
military. You're too far away to make out the
details of it. That one has a wooden carved sign

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:10.982
that says Soldier's Spirit. It's currently put on
the edge of the stage.

01:02:10.982 --> 01:02:16.684
LAURA: Where in relation to all of this is the
Hearth of the Allhammer? Because I know it's in

01:02:16.684 --> 01:02:18.337
the Pentamarket.

01:02:18.337 --> 01:02:23.871
MATT: The Hearth of the Allhammer would be on the
other side of this large, forum-like structure.

01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:28.453
SAM: I'm going to walk over to the Eagle Shot, was
it?

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.923
MATT: Eagle Shot, yes.

01:02:29.923 --> 01:02:31.839
SAM: What's that game look like?

01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:37.472
MATT: As you approach, there are two crownsguard
that are helming a small, compact archery range.

01:02:37.472 --> 01:02:44.017
There's a series of trees that are at the very
back that mark what would normally be an alcove in

01:02:44.017 --> 01:02:49.232
this small park, but within this alcove there are
three archery targets that are slightly off from

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:55.122
each other at different distances. They have a
rack with different bows and a whole cache of

01:02:55.122 --> 01:02:56.630
arrows that are set to the side.

01:02:56.630 --> 01:03:01.495
MARISHA: (laughter) I'm just standing there like,
what?

01:03:01.495 --> 01:03:05.230
SAM: Bows? Nah.

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:06.129
LAURA: You could do it!

01:03:06.129 --> 01:03:12.328
SAM: It's too hard to pull it back! This thing
does it for you, look. (click)

01:03:12.328 --> 01:03:16.348
LAURA and MARISHA: Maybe they'll let you use it.

01:03:16.348 --> 01:03:23.372
SAM: I guess I could go ask. Excuse me, sir or
madam?

01:03:23.372 --> 01:03:29.474
MATT: The first guard turns around. "Oh, little
girl, good to see you. What can I help you with?"

01:03:29.474 --> 01:03:33.933
SAM: I'm wondering if you have to use a bow and
arrow to compete or can you use one of these?

01:03:33.933 --> 01:03:40.211
MATT: "What do you-- " Which, you still have a
bolt nocked in this hand crossbow. He's like, "Put the-- "

01:03:41.154 --> 01:03:45.022
SAM: I'm not going to fire it at you! I don't have
anything wrong with it.

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:48.085
MATT: "Little miss, you shouldn't be waving that
around in public. I'm not sure how you got a hold

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:50.512
"of that. Where's your mother?"

01:03:50.512 --> 01:03:52.978
SAM: My father is over there.

01:03:52.978 --> 01:03:56.714
LIAM: Did you want to play this game?

01:03:56.714 --> 01:03:58.873
SAM: Yes, papa.

01:03:58.873 --> 01:04:04.907
MATT: "Unfortunately, by the rules you have to use
one of the provided bows."

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.127
SAM: This one is pretty good.

01:04:06.127 --> 01:04:10.418
MATT: "Please put-- sir, your daughter is a danger
to the general public right now."

01:04:10.418 --> 01:04:12.769
LIAM: No, she is an excellent shot. She's
trained.

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:17.991
MATT: "Well, she has not been trained proper use
of that in a space in which is it safe for other

01:04:17.991 --> 01:04:19.996
"people to be around. I'm just saying."

01:04:19.996 --> 01:04:21.907
LIAM: Sure. How much to play your game?

01:04:21.907 --> 01:04:25.311
MATT: "Could I see that for a second?"

01:04:25.311 --> 01:04:27.201
LIAM: My daughter's crossbow, you want?

01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:33.925
MATT: Takes it, the crossbow, and pulls the string
back, removes the tension, hands it back. "There.

01:04:33.925 --> 01:04:43.738
"Would either of you like to play some Eagle Shot?"
Behind them, somebody like--

01:04:43.738 --> 01:04:47.865
SAM: Now I feel like we <i>have</i> to. He just
human-splained me.

01:04:47.865 --> 01:04:51.087
(laughter)

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:58.620
MATT: The other guard behind is currently setting
up an older woman who is in the process of getting

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:02.160
the arrow lined up, and it keeps falling out of
her grip and the other guard's like, "No, put it

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.902
"here," and getting ready. Finally fires an arrow
and it goes and disappears past one of the trees,

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.456
"Oh, no!"

01:05:07.456 --> 01:05:11.730
LIAM: Well, you know, I'll tell you something. If
you want to have a laugh, let's have me do some

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.590
physical sports, so that should be pretty good.

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:18.246
SAM: That'll be fun. All right, let's do it. We
will both enter your competition.

01:05:18.246 --> 01:05:24.582
MATT: "Very well. That's one silver piece for
three shots. Closest bullseye, if acquired, you

01:05:24.582 --> 01:05:31.276
"get a rat from a cage." He pulls off from the side
here; you see a small stack of wicker cages with

01:05:31.276 --> 01:05:37.137
rats inside them. "Get yourself a pet rat. If you
go ahead and get that middle bullseye, about part

01:05:37.137 --> 01:05:43.073
"way across that range, there, you win yourself one
of these finely crafted wooden swords." They have

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:50.931
this decently whittled wooden sword. The center
cross hilt for it is strapped with twine tightly.

01:05:50.931 --> 01:05:55.152
Swings it a couple times and sets it down, lays it
against and it rests and hits the ground off to

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:59.401
the side. "Now the farthest one over there--" and
you watch as the old woman pulls another shot and

01:05:59.401 --> 01:06:04.755
it almost hits the far target before it gets stuck
in the tree about ten feet behind it, "Hit that

01:06:04.755 --> 01:06:14.613
"one way back there and that one will get you
this." He pulls up a haphazard, stitched doll with

01:06:14.613 --> 01:06:18.842
button eyes, like the stitches are too wide so it
looks like the crosses behind it are visible.

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:25.757
There's no mouth. There's like, matted twine hair,
some felt-like material that's made a crown and a

01:06:25.757 --> 01:06:29.616
cape. "Of our fine King Bertrand Dwendal."

01:06:29.616 --> 01:06:39.218
LIAM: Just a question for you. Should I hit the
one in the back, which is highly likely, could we

01:06:39.218 --> 01:06:41.568
have the doll's weight in rats instead?

01:06:41.568 --> 01:06:51.170
MATT: He gives you a look like you said a bad
word. He goes, "I suppose."

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.149
SAM: How far is the farthest one?

01:06:54.149 --> 01:06:58.410
MATT: He glances back. "It's probably about 80
feet."

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:01.143
SAM: Let's try.

01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:04.635
MARISHA: Nott, I really want that wooden sword.

01:07:04.635 --> 01:07:08.103
SAM: You don't have a sword, do you?

01:07:08.103 --> 01:07:09.318
TRAVIS: Creepy little doll, man!

01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:11.958
MARISHA: Don't listen to Fjord.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:15.417
LAURA: Get the doll. I bet it's cursed!

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:18.320
SAM: I can't work with this kind of pressure!

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.994
MARISHA: Nott. If you get that sword, I'll give
you my jade bracelet.

01:07:22.994 --> 01:07:26.420
SAM: Oh man!

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.135
LIAM: Is this an attack roll?

01:07:29.135 --> 01:07:33.174
MATT: It is an attack roll, and it's a short bow.
He said about 80 feet, but the farthest one's

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:38.129
about 100 feet. Which means it is in its second
range increment, so the one in the back is at disadvantage.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:41.502
SAM: I'm not proficient in this thing at all,
right?

01:07:41.502 --> 01:07:45.582
MATT: Well, let's go ahead and see. Rogue
proficiencies. It's a simple ranged weapon. You

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:53.703
should be. I'm pretty sure you are. Yep, simple
weapons. You are proficient with the short bow.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:58.534
"Who's going first, if you don't mind me asking?"

01:07:58.534 --> 01:08:01.087
LIAM: Let me show my daughter how it is done.

01:08:01.087 --> 01:08:06.186
MATT: "Of course, understood." Hands you one of
the short bows off of the side and three arrows.

01:08:06.186 --> 01:08:08.881
They're all right in their construction.

01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:17.555
LIAM: Watch my form and technique. I pick up the
bow, and I take the stick thing. I pull it back like this.

01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:19.334
MATT: "Oh-- I--"

01:08:19.334 --> 01:08:20.010
LIAM: Yeah?

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:21.122
MATT: "No, continue."

01:08:21.122 --> 01:08:23.036
LIAM: (sneezes)

01:08:23.036 --> 01:08:27.342
MATT: Which target are you aiming for?

01:08:27.342 --> 01:08:28.829
LIAM: The farthest one, obviously.

01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:30.438
MATT: The farthest? All right, with disadvantage.
Add your dexterity modifier.

01:08:30.438 --> 01:08:32.300
LIAM: Oh.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.618
MATT: I do not think you're proficient--

01:08:34.618 --> 01:08:39.178
LIAM: Aww, no, not at all. That is a three.

01:08:39.178 --> 01:08:44.110
MATT: Well, as a wizard, you might be, actually.
For simple weapons.

01:08:47.226 --> 01:08:49.507
Nope. No, you are not.

01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:52.705
TALIESIN: Is it just simple weapons, or is it
simple ranged weapons?

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:55.790
MATT: Well, it's simple ranged weapons, but those
count as simple weapons.

01:08:56.123 --> 01:08:57.965
TALIESIN: Simple weapons, okay.

01:08:57.965 --> 01:09:03.185
MATT: It gets about 40 or so feet before it gets
stuck in the dirt. He's like, "That was good."

01:09:03.817 --> 01:09:07.834
LIAM: Hmm. The <i>fretching</i> on that one was
probably not very good. Let me try again.

01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:11.126
SAM: I think it's fletch-- yeah.

01:09:11.126 --> 01:09:14.837
LIAM: Listen, I have read a lot of books. I know
it is <i>fretching</i>.

01:09:14.837 --> 01:09:18.881
MATT: You nock your secondary arrow. Take a shot.

01:09:26.757 --> 01:09:31.102
LIAM: Nope. Dang it. The second rolls are always
really good! That is an eight.

01:09:31.763 --> 01:09:38.812
MATT: This one gets about five feet further and
almost hits a squirrel. You hear (squeaking), and

01:09:38.812 --> 01:09:40.434
it darts off into a nearby bush.

01:09:40.434 --> 01:09:42.344
LAURA: You could have got your own prize!

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:45.857
SAM: One more shot. You can do this!

01:09:45.857 --> 01:09:49.072
LIAM: This is not well-crafted. I grab my wire
that I use for the message spell, and I put my

01:09:49.072 --> 01:09:51.765
hair into a little ponytail.

01:09:51.765 --> 01:09:54.163
LAURA: You shouldn't use wire to do that, Caleb.

01:09:54.163 --> 01:09:56.896
MARISHA: It damages your hair.

01:09:57.689 --> 01:10:04.920
LIAM: (pew) Okay. Oh no. Ten.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:13.860
MATT: This one gets 40 feet, which is halfway
there, before it hits the ground and sticks into

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:20.441
the dirt. As soon as it finishes, there's like a,
"That was good. Go fetch that." The other guard

01:10:20.441 --> 01:10:22.901
runs out and grabs the arrows to retrieve them.

01:10:22.901 --> 01:10:28.536
LIAM: Full disclosure: I have no athletic ability.
That went as well as I expected it to.

01:10:28.536 --> 01:10:36.888
MATT: "That is surprising. Well, a fine Harvest
Close to you, friend, and for your daughter."

01:10:36.888 --> 01:10:38.133
SAM: Yes, it's my turn.

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.815
MATT: Hands the bow over, and a set of three
arrows.

01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:47.189
LAURA: He's going with the dice jail dice! You
should not have done that.

01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:48.783
SAM: Do I add proficiency and--

01:10:48.783 --> 01:10:49.944
MATT: Proficiency and your dex mod.

01:10:49.944 --> 01:10:50.833
SAM: 11.

01:10:50.833 --> 01:10:56.107
MATT: This one arcs. It almost gets near the
target, but ends up veering off to the right and

01:10:56.107 --> 01:11:02.108
ends up vanishing behind one of the secondary
targets near the tree. He says, "Yeah, that was

01:11:02.108 --> 01:11:04.848
"better than your father."

01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:08.280
SAM: What is that? 12.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.362
MATT: This one hits the actual base of the far
target. Misses the target entirely, but it hits

01:11:13.362 --> 01:11:17.052
the actual plank of wood that's holding it up.

01:11:17.052 --> 01:11:26.341
MARISHA: See, the beads have a little bit of like,
gold embossing, etching inside of them.

01:11:26.341 --> 01:11:30.463
SAM: Far target. 15.

01:11:30.463 --> 01:11:37.229
MATT: It hits the bottom of the target. No
bullseye, but you hit it. He's like, "That was

01:11:37.229 --> 01:11:39.004
"actually very good."

01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:42.747
SAM: Shut up! I don't need you to condescend to
me! Give me another one!

01:11:42.747 --> 01:11:46.870
MATT: "Right away, little missy." Grabs three more
arrows.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.531
LIAM: I slap down the silver for it.

01:11:48.531 --> 01:11:49.768
SAM: Thank you!

01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:51.022
LIAM: Yeah. It was two, right?

01:11:51.022 --> 01:11:52.854
MATT: One silver for three shots.

01:11:52.854 --> 01:11:55.055
LIAM: I put down two silver.

01:11:55.055 --> 01:11:57.758
MATT: Six more shots, all right. "There you go."

01:11:57.758 --> 01:11:59.595
LAURA: She won't need six more shots.

01:11:59.595 --> 01:12:04.527
SAM: Two, in quick succession. 20.

01:12:05.398 --> 01:12:16.721
MATT: As you pull back, perfect bullseye into the
farthest target. There's this brief pause as the

01:12:16.721 --> 01:12:19.201
guard spins around and goes, "What-- "

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:25.929
SAM: I'm not done! I get four more shots! Two in
quick succession to the middle one.

01:12:29.081 --> 01:12:31.131
TALIESIN: Is it still disadvantage to the middle
target?

01:12:31.131 --> 01:12:32.326
MATT: Middle one is not at disadvantage.

01:12:32.326 --> 01:12:42.147
SAM: Oh, well then. Should I reroll? Okay. I will
still use your shitty dice. Two 23s.

01:12:42.729 --> 01:12:49.109
MATT: Both arrows-- we're talking, like, Disney
Robin Hood-style, one arrow, next one splits the

01:12:49.109 --> 01:12:54.548
first arrow. The guard's still recovering from the
first bullseye, he's like, "What?!"

01:12:54.548 --> 01:12:59.752
SAM: Then two more. To the short one. 16 and a
21.

01:12:59.752 --> 01:13:11.011
MATT: Both hit at the same time. The guard looks
slowly over towards you. "Well done."

01:13:11.011 --> 01:13:14.372
LIAM: Now go home and get your fucking shinebox.

01:13:16.288 --> 01:13:19.696
MATT: "Here's your doll."

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:21.851
TALIESIN: And the sword?

01:13:21.851 --> 01:13:24.129
MATT: "Two swords."

01:13:24.129 --> 01:13:25.462
LAURA: Two swords!

01:13:25.462 --> 01:13:27.823
ASHLEY: I thought it was the rats--

01:13:27.823 --> 01:13:29.126
MATT: "Two rats."

01:13:29.126 --> 01:13:30.544
LAURA: Double rats!

01:13:30.544 --> 01:13:34.200
ASHLEY: Double rats, yeah. That's it? Because I
thought that was dinner. We have--

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.244
TALIESIN: We're not eating the rats.

01:13:36.244 --> 01:13:38.499
LAURA: We'll find some other dinner, Yasha.

01:13:38.499 --> 01:13:40.802
ASHLEY: It's my favorite.

01:13:40.802 --> 01:13:46.329
MATT: You now have in your inventory: two rats in
rat cages, two wooden swords--

01:13:46.329 --> 01:13:48.870
SAM: You can have <i>both</i> wooden swords.

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:50.477
MARISHA: Oh, thanks!

01:13:50.477 --> 01:13:51.854
TRAVIS: Yasha, do you eat rat a lot?

01:13:51.854 --> 01:13:54.825
MATT: A hand-stitched doll of King Bertrand
Dwendal.

01:13:54.825 --> 01:13:56.204
LAURA: That's a really good doll.

01:13:56.204 --> 01:13:58.836
SAM: Oh, it really is. Would you like the rats?

01:13:58.836 --> 01:14:00.619
ASHLEY: Well, were you going to eat one?

01:14:00.619 --> 01:14:02.385
SAM: Well, we can share.

01:14:02.385 --> 01:14:04.319
TRAVIS: Alive, or do you cook it?

01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:08.900
ASHLEY: No, I like to have it cooked. It falls off
the bone. It's like a nice--

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.795
SAM: Oh, I can wait. I guess.

01:14:11.795 --> 01:14:13.943
LIAM: It really depends on what you have at your
disposal. Yeah?

01:14:13.943 --> 01:14:20.378
SAM: Later. It'll be a celebratory-- we could
candy them.

01:14:20.378 --> 01:14:22.752
LAURA: Or caramel them!

01:14:22.752 --> 01:14:24.468
ASHLEY: Let's try it.

01:14:24.468 --> 01:14:27.320
LAURA: Can I start to wander away towards the
Allhammer?

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.781
MARISHA: Look, guys. I'm Molly. Look! I want to go
over to the military booth.

01:14:32.781 --> 01:14:34.127
SAM: Don't cut yourself!

01:14:34.127 --> 01:14:39.647
MATT: While this is happening, Jester, you make
your way around the large forum, and there you see

01:14:39.647 --> 01:14:43.031
the Hearth of the Allhammer. You've passed it
before, and you can see it's the domed, iron

01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:49.485
structure. It's been left to rust a bit at the
edges. The tops of the dome are polished where

01:14:49.779 --> 01:14:56.483
it's easily accessible, but the very peak of the
dome is a little bit red, brown, rusted. There are

01:14:56.729 --> 01:15:02.663
a number of open arches in the inside, and you see
the large, central forge that marks the center of the temple.

01:15:03.019 --> 01:15:07.058
LAURA: Is there a statue of the Allfather? The
Allhammer guy?

01:15:07.058 --> 01:15:16.004
MATT: You do see the large anvil that marks there
has the symbol of the Allfather printed on each

01:15:16.004 --> 01:15:22.976
side and acts as both a ceremonial anvil for the
creation of religious artefacts and items as part

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:29.556
of worship and as the central statue for worship
itself. That is the closest thing there is in this

01:15:29.556 --> 01:15:32.831
temple to a central focus of worship.

01:15:32.831 --> 01:15:37.537
TRAVIS: Nott, be real careful with that doll; they
put little spirits of kids in those.

01:15:37.537 --> 01:15:41.242
LAURA: Is there any guards around or are they
mostly gone because of the celebration?

01:15:41.242 --> 01:15:47.248
MATT: It's not busy on the inside because right
now everyone's focus is on the actual celebration.

01:15:47.248 --> 01:15:54.330
There are three individuals that are manning the
interior of the temple, one of which is the

01:15:54.330 --> 01:16:00.352
herald. Each temple in the city has a herald
that's the keeper of that temple. It's a female

01:16:00.352 --> 01:16:06.000
dwarf, dark brown hair and three long braids that
trail past to the middle back with a chainmail

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.593
robe on that descends past the knees and is
currently sitting on a bench and eating dried meat

01:16:13.593 --> 01:16:17.091
out of a small pouch and people watching as people
walk by the temple. Nobody's in there actively

01:16:17.091 --> 01:16:19.097
worshipping at the moment.

01:16:19.097 --> 01:16:24.951
LAURA: I go inside.

01:16:25.821 --> 01:16:27.957
SAM: Burn the place down.

01:16:28.454 --> 01:16:31.743
MATT: Do you go in trying to avoid attention or
are you announcing yourself as you arrive?

01:16:31.743 --> 01:16:35.761
LAURA: No. I'm going to casually walk in. Just,
you know.

01:16:36.951 --> 01:16:42.617
MATT: As you walk in, a voice in the corner from
the direction of where the herald was goes, "Miss,

01:16:42.617 --> 01:16:47.001
"if you need something, don't be afraid to let me
know. We're just sitting around."

01:16:47.001 --> 01:16:48.846
LAURA: Thank you.

01:16:48.846 --> 01:16:50.645
MATT: "Of course."

01:16:50.943 --> 01:16:59.448
LAURA: Oh, I should have disguised myself first. I
leave. Go literally right around the corner and

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.607
disguise myself, and I come right back in.

01:17:01.607 --> 01:17:02.713
MATT: What do you disguise yourself as?

01:17:02.713 --> 01:17:09.122
LAURA: I cast Disguise Self as an old woman-- oof,
who just burped?

01:17:09.122 --> 01:17:10.133
MATT: You?

01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:24.744
LAURA: No, it wasn't me. With like a really tight
bun and little teeny glasses and a cane. I guess I

01:17:24.744 --> 01:17:27.397
can't make myself have a cane, can I?

01:17:27.397 --> 01:17:28.422
MATT: No, that's not an extension of--

01:17:28.422 --> 01:17:30.407
LAURA: All right, well I walk kind of hunched
over.

01:17:30.407 --> 01:17:37.944
MATT: Okay. As you come around the corner and make
your way in, you saunter in the far end of the

01:17:37.944 --> 01:17:41.954
temple through one of the arches that marks the
interior, come in through the shadow and the

01:17:41.954 --> 01:17:47.156
herald once again goes, "If you need something,
right over here."

01:17:47.156 --> 01:17:48.751
LAURA: (grumbling)

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:54.509
MATT: "All right, that's fine." Goes back to--
(chuckles) already seems taken aback by your

01:17:54.509 --> 01:17:56.436
presence. What do you want to do?

01:17:56.436 --> 01:17:58.252
LAURA: Is there anybody in there? Nobody's in
there?

01:17:58.252 --> 01:17:59.257
MATT: Well, I mean, there's people in there.

01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:00.178
LAURA: (whispered) Oh, shit.

01:18:00.178 --> 01:18:04.500
MATT: There's the herald who's sitting in the back
eating on the opposite end of the anvil and

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:09.301
there's two other folks that are on the outskirts
of the arches, looking out into the crowd, just

01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:10.402
people watching.

01:18:10.402 --> 01:18:15.964
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to walk around to the back
end of the anvil and act like I'm praying, but I'm

01:18:15.964 --> 01:18:20.248
going to wait until it looks like they're all
looking the other direction.

01:18:20.248 --> 01:18:24.960
MATT: As you begin to pray, the two others that
are on the outside, who've noticed you enter,

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.108
their attention doesn't wander to you for too long
before they go back out to the celebration, people

01:18:30.108 --> 01:18:34.885
walking by and people watching in general. You're
on the opposite side of the anvil from the herald

01:18:34.885 --> 01:18:39.014
who's still chewing on her meat. What do you want
to do?

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:46.143
LAURA: I would like to get my paint set out and
paint pink hearts all over the back side of the

01:18:46.143 --> 01:18:57.405
anvil along with "The Traveler was here". Then I'm
going to leave a couple travel brochures for the

01:18:57.405 --> 01:19:06.071
Traveler. Yeah, I think that's good but they're
sizeable hearts. I want nice pretty pink, all over

01:19:06.071 --> 01:19:08.192
the hammer. The anvil.

01:19:08.192 --> 01:19:14.157
MATT: Just for the sake of presentation because
you're doing this with a bit of haste, knowing

01:19:14.157 --> 01:19:16.933
that you're under pressure. Go ahead and roll a
performance check.

01:19:18.655 --> 01:19:26.858
LAURA: Okay. With a pink dice. That's pretty good.
18.

01:19:27.252 --> 01:19:38.373
MATT: 18. As you quickly begin to finish this
heart, Traveler was here, you hear (yawning)

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:43.707
across the way from the herald. You stop for a
second-- no reaction. Continue going. You finish

01:19:43.707 --> 01:19:47.849
up the art piece. One of the other guardians of
the temple begins to turn around and walk back

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:52.380
towards the herald and you pull back for a moment,
but they turned away from you and it seems that

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:57.559
you've managed to go this far without being
noticed. You finish up your last heart, the

01:19:57.559 --> 01:20:00.353
exclamation point and the underline of the
Traveler.

01:20:01.183 --> 01:20:06.231
LAURA: Oh, and I'm going to take some sequins off
of my sequins glove and sprinkle it on there.

01:20:06.231 --> 01:20:09.348
MATT: (tinkling)

01:20:09.348 --> 01:20:11.652
LIAM: A little granny painting furiously.

01:20:11.652 --> 01:20:17.281
MATT: Just (straining). You put the pamphlets
there on the side, slip them beneath the offering

01:20:17.281 --> 01:20:18.706
bowl at the base of it.

01:20:18.706 --> 01:20:23.896
LAURA: I want one sitting right on top of the
anvil. Then I'm going to leave.

01:20:23.896 --> 01:20:25.244
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check on that one.

01:20:25.244 --> 01:20:26.332
SAM: Oh no.

01:20:26.332 --> 01:20:29.306
MATT: Because that will be creeping into the view
of the herald.

01:20:31.414 --> 01:20:32.590
LAURA: 11.

01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:41.981
MATT: As you place it on top, the voice on the
opposite end goes, "Do you need help there?

01:20:41.981 --> 01:20:44.153
"Dearie?"

01:20:44.153 --> 01:20:49.529
LAURA: (quavering) Oh, no, just leaving a little
message for my son here. He's a big worshipper.

01:20:49.529 --> 01:20:53.092
Ah. I walk away.

01:20:53.483 --> 01:20:57.848
MATT: As you get up and start walking away, the
herald stands up and begins walking towards the

01:20:57.848 --> 01:20:59.456
other side of the anvil.

01:20:59.456 --> 01:21:01.021
LAURA: I walk really quickly.

01:21:01.854 --> 01:21:04.518
MATT: There's like speedily running granny into
the crowd and as you get--

01:21:04.518 --> 01:21:05.618
LAURA: Drop disguise.

01:21:05.618 --> 01:21:08.047
MATT: Drop disguise-- in the middle of the crowd?

01:21:08.047 --> 01:21:10.899
LAURA: Well, no, I zoom around the corner.

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:13.588
MATT: Still in your disguise as you're charging
into the crowd, behind you, you hear a voice

01:21:13.588 --> 01:21:21.851
(scream). "That old woman! Find her!" There's
screaming and you hear this ruckus as people

01:21:21.851 --> 01:21:26.591
around start looking behind at the shouting sound
as you dart around the corner. Drop disguise and

01:21:26.591 --> 01:21:31.517
as you do, you can now see the herald and the two
keepers of the temple are now pushing through the

01:21:31.517 --> 01:21:38.100
crowd, looking, searching like, "Has anyone seen
an old woman?" Is describing you as best they can

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:45.168
and it looks like there's a bit of commotion going
on. As you begin to disperse into the crowd,

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:45.564
making your way--

01:21:45.564 --> 01:21:48.724
LAURA: I take a bite of my caramel apple, and I go
walking down.

01:21:48.724 --> 01:21:52.309
MATT: You hear a crunch sound and your hand shakes
for a second and you look down and a mysterious

01:21:52.309 --> 01:21:54.763
secondary bite was taken out of the apple.

01:21:57.806 --> 01:21:59.959
LAURA: (gasp) I lick the spot.

01:21:59.959 --> 01:22:02.264
(groaning)

01:22:02.563 --> 01:22:04.980
SAM: You're making out with your god? Gross.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:09.515
MATT: They have a special relationship. While this
is happening, you head to the military stand, you

01:22:09.515 --> 01:22:10.532
said? Anybody going with Beau?

01:22:10.532 --> 01:22:11.460
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go.

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.867
TALIESIN: I also follow.

01:22:12.867 --> 01:22:17.691
MATT: You guys approach at this point towards the
Soldier Spear. You see this larger platform in the

01:22:17.691 --> 01:22:22.957
middle of the Pentamarket. There you see the
central military figures wearing ornamental armor

01:22:22.957 --> 01:22:29.549
with a top knot. There is a table set up there
with these benches and you can see there are two

01:22:29.549 --> 01:22:37.765
burly men, one who is this hairy, heavy thick
woodsman type who is wearing a leather apron and--

01:22:37.765 --> 01:22:39.319
SAM: A Sam Riegel-type.

01:22:39.319 --> 01:22:47.541
MATT: Yes, exactly. He's like super butch. Hand
clasped with a trained soldier who's wearing

01:22:47.541 --> 01:22:51.849
elements of the Righteous Brand armor but has
taken bits of it off and they're both going

01:22:51.849 --> 01:22:55.999
(grunting). They're in the middle of an arm
wrestling match and they're both tensing back and

01:22:55.999 --> 01:23:02.368
forth (grunting) before the brawny guy slams the
soldier's arm down to the table. He goes

01:23:02.368 --> 01:23:06.668
(yelling). The crowd around goes (cheering).
There's a shout and cheer and the gentleman in the

01:23:06.668 --> 01:23:15.079
center goes, "That was well done. Well done and
congratulations to you. Now that you've proven

01:23:15.079 --> 01:23:19.583
"yourself my friend, would you be interested at all
in joining the Righteous Brand? Being a strong

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:23.134
"warrior in his own right," and the guy's like,
"Ah, piss off! I don't want to." He goes like,

01:23:23.134 --> 01:23:30.479
"It's a good wage. Gold per day. Fed. All the
equipment you need. You help keep the Empire safe.

01:23:30.479 --> 01:23:36.103
"No? All right, very well. Anyone else?"

01:23:37.713 --> 01:23:39.050
MARISHA: Yeah, what's up?

01:23:41.714 --> 01:23:45.745
MATT: "Well, we are having a contest to see who
here is the strongest."

01:23:45.745 --> 01:23:48.393
MARISHA: Cool. Who's the strongest?

01:23:48.393 --> 01:23:55.747
MATT: "Well, so far, it's that gentleman." Points
over to the heavy, burly fellow who's off to the

01:23:55.747 --> 01:23:59.439
side. He's currently flexing and cracking his
wrist.

01:23:59.729 --> 01:24:03.003
MARISHA: If you win, do you have to stick around
and arm wrestle a whole bunch of people because

01:24:03.003 --> 01:24:07.880
you're suddenly the best? I don't want to dedicate
more time to this.

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:11.413
MATT: "I mean, you don't have to."

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:15.532
MARISHA: Do I still get to be the best though if
this guy sticks around and just keeps going?

01:24:15.532 --> 01:24:19.553
MATT: "Probably, but don't be surprised if other
contenders start following you around the town to

01:24:19.553 --> 01:24:21.221
"try and take your title."

01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:22.868
LIAM: This is like the King of Kong.

01:24:22.868 --> 01:24:25.256
MARISHA: Is this really that important to you
guys? Yeah.

01:24:26.256 --> 01:24:32.119
MATT: "Not to us, but it's a fun place to display
your skill and talent. Plus, we're always looking

01:24:32.119 --> 01:24:37.019
"for some fine young soldiers to come and join us
out there on the fields. To take down the

01:24:37.019 --> 01:24:42.546
"Xhorhasian evils and keep all these fine folks
here well taken care of."

01:24:43.256 --> 01:24:44.538
MARISHA: For a gold a day?

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:45.592
MATT: "Yeah."

01:24:46.242 --> 01:24:48.706
MARISHA: Buying people's loyalty for a gold a
day?

01:24:48.706 --> 01:24:49.834
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:59.058
MARISHA: Sorry, I just-- all right. (sighs) Heard
something about a Victory Pit. Is this the Victory Pit?

01:24:59.058 --> 01:25:00.530
SAM: She's the worst.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:08.479
MATT: He goes, "No, you're not--" Points over and
that large forum building, that circular forum

01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:11.876
building that you saw that now the crowd's
starting to wash into that had been closed off

01:25:11.876 --> 01:25:17.197
previous weeks, he goes, "That, that is the
Victory Pit. That will be happening in a few

01:25:17.197 --> 01:25:21.829
"hours, but you're welcome to compete here if
you're feeling so feisty."

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:25.016
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

01:25:25.017 --> 01:25:26.844
MATT: "What's your name?"

01:25:26.844 --> 01:25:27.559
MARISHA: Beau.

01:25:27.559 --> 01:25:30.973
MATT: "Ah. Recruiter Leopold Wanstiker. Pleasure
to meet you."

01:25:30.973 --> 01:25:37.779
MARISHA: Person Beau. Nice to meet you. What is
it? Leopold Sydney?

01:25:38.489 --> 01:25:44.997
MATT: Recruiter Leopold Wanstiker.
W-A-N-S-T-I-K-E-R.

01:25:45.457 --> 01:25:51.240
MARISHA: Wang stacker. All right.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:56.357
(laughter)

01:25:56.357 --> 01:25:56.607
MATT: So.

01:25:58.197 --> 01:25:59.114
TRAVIS: This is top knot dude?

01:26:00.714 --> 01:26:02.089
MATT: Top knot guy, yep.

01:26:03.439 --> 01:26:04.069
LIAM: That's the wang.

01:26:05.749 --> 01:26:10.221
MATT: "Whoever wins this, gets to go up against
our finest solder who should be back from his

01:26:10.221 --> 01:26:17.512
"lunch break here in the next ten minutes or so. We
have the new challenger Beau. Let's see." He

01:26:17.512 --> 01:26:25.057
points over to the grizzled-looking beastly man
who's currently chugging down the final bits of a

01:26:25.057 --> 01:26:31.416
tankard of ale. Spins around, wipes it off his
beard and stands up. "Yeah, I'm coming." He gets

01:26:31.416 --> 01:26:35.405
up onto the edge of the stage and goes, "Well,
this is Kendall."

01:26:35.405 --> 01:26:40.286
(laughter)

01:26:40.286 --> 01:26:46.525
MATT: "He's a strong fellow. Good luck." He sits
down.

01:26:46.525 --> 01:26:48.221
MARISHA: I'm going to fail this miserably.

01:26:48.221 --> 01:26:54.137
MATT: Sits down at his stool, puts his meaty arm
out with the fingers and goes--

01:26:58.237 --> 01:26:59.726
MARISHA: Good to meet you, Kendall.

01:26:59.726 --> 01:27:00.620
MATT: "Sure."

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.290
MARISHA: Ugh, it's sweaty.

01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:03.557
MATT: It is sweaty.

01:27:03.557 --> 01:27:05.666
TRAVIS: Calm your mind. Just steel your mind.

01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:06.235
MARISHA: Oh, god.

01:27:06.235 --> 01:27:11.442
MATT: Leopold goes, "One, two, three!" Go ahead
and make a strength check.

01:27:11.442 --> 01:27:12.701
MARISHA: Oh, god, just--

01:27:14.231 --> 01:27:15.927
LIAM: Those knuckle hairs are like fly legs.

01:27:15.927 --> 01:27:17.396
MARISHA: Just a check?

01:27:17.636 --> 01:27:19.632
MATT: Yep. Just a d20, add your strength
modifier.

01:27:19.632 --> 01:27:20.252
LIAM: Oh.

01:27:20.252 --> 01:27:21.144
MARISHA: Five.

01:27:21.144 --> 01:27:28.611
MATT: Five. At that center point, you immediately
begin to give to his grasp. You see this slight

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:32.865
grin begin to curl underneath his wiry beard as
his arm begins to push you close to the edge of

01:27:32.865 --> 01:27:34.048
the table. Make another strength check.

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:34.582
TRAVIS: Dig in!

01:27:35.472 --> 01:27:39.836
MARISHA: A critter gave me this. They said it was
lucky. It's not that lucky. 12.

01:27:39.836 --> 01:27:44.144
MATT: 12. With that (slams) onto the table. You
lose.

01:27:44.144 --> 01:27:45.762
MARISHA: Ow!

01:27:45.762 --> 01:27:49.385
MATT: Knuckles a little bruised from the slam. He
gets up and is like, "Ha!"

01:27:50.735 --> 01:27:52.376
TALIESIN: That was worth following around for.

01:27:52.376 --> 01:27:53.615
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:27:54.465 --> 01:27:55.236
MARISHA: Ah.

01:27:55.236 --> 01:27:56.595
TRAVIS: Thought you were going to beat him.

01:27:56.595 --> 01:28:02.658
MARISHA: I'm very slippery, I'm not-- I want to do
that Victory Pit thing, though.

01:28:02.658 --> 01:28:09.136
MATT: "Well done though, Beau. Well done. Here."
He hands you a small piece of parchment that's

01:28:09.136 --> 01:28:13.913
rolled up and goes, "This is information about, if
you'd be so interested, in coming and joining the

01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:14.641
"Righteous Brand."

01:28:16.221 --> 01:28:18.015
SAM: Audition for our acapella group.

01:28:20.505 --> 01:28:21.289
TALIESIN: Kingsman.

01:28:23.719 --> 01:28:27.425
MATT: "You can find us at the Marrow Keeps of the
Righteous Brand on the outskirts of the northern

01:28:27.425 --> 01:28:29.890
"end of Zadash, should you be so interested."

01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:31.030
TRAVIS: Marrow Keeps?

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.631
MATT: Yes.

01:28:32.711 --> 01:28:34.127
SAM: We've heard of that before.

01:28:34.127 --> 01:28:35.143
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:28:39.243 --> 01:28:44.793
MATT: This is in the area of the Signet Wall which
is the military district of the city.

01:28:44.793 --> 01:28:45.781
MARISHA: Okay.

01:28:47.471 --> 01:28:53.701
MATT: "Anyone else?" Another gentleman raises his
hand and gets up on stage and they begin to do a

01:28:53.701 --> 01:28:59.955
showdown. The two of them begin to go back and
forth. However, that same beastly figure, Kendall,

01:28:59.955 --> 01:29:05.398
still manages to, defeat the guy and send him to
the table, get up again and "Ha!" Then at some

01:29:05.398 --> 01:29:11.666
point, shortly thereafter, Leopold goes, "Ah, he
returns! He returns! (chuckling) Gunther Prast,

01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:17.858
"our finest soldier here in the city, would like to
challenge the current standing contender." You

01:29:17.858 --> 01:29:24.909
watch now as this massive behemoth of a man, like
the Mountain from Game of Thrones, about seven

01:29:24.909 --> 01:29:31.112
foot, 350 pounds guy wearing the Righteous Brand
silver and red armor, gets up onto the stage

01:29:31.112 --> 01:29:36.388
(heavy steps). Clean-shaven, except for this
perpetual five o'clock shadow that doesn't seem to

01:29:36.388 --> 01:29:41.991
leave his square jaw, his hair is trimmed super
short and you see the receding hairline curling

01:29:41.991 --> 01:29:48.709
back into a widow's peak. Sits on the table, puts
his arm out there and you can see the huntsman,

01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:55.219
Kendall, for the first time, lose his cool. You
watch as the two of them grasp together and

01:29:55.219 --> 01:29:56.567
they're going to begin to roll off.

01:29:56.567 --> 01:29:57.242
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:29:57.242 --> 01:29:58.552
LAURA: What's going on?

01:29:58.712 --> 01:29:59.921
SAM: Beau lost.

01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:01.997
LAURA: Beau lost at arm wrestling?

01:30:01.997 --> 01:30:05.809
MATT: You watch as the hands tighten and with
that, Gunther begins to twist the arm, further

01:30:06.089 --> 01:30:09.786
down, further down. You can see, the huntsman
character is starting to grimace.

01:30:09.786 --> 01:30:11.891
TRAVIS: Come on, Gunther.

01:30:11.891 --> 01:30:17.584
MATT: However, pushes it back in the center. Now
they're currently neck and neck. Once again,

01:30:17.584 --> 01:30:26.386
Gunther pushes him back. And with that final hit.
Wham! Kendall is taken out, like, (groaning).

01:30:26.386 --> 01:30:30.808
Grasps his hand and rubs his fingers, and darts
off the stage, seemingly shamed in front of a

01:30:30.808 --> 01:30:34.421
crowd of people. Everyone's like, "Oh!" There's
now probably about 30-40 people who watched that

01:30:34.421 --> 01:30:35.022
last match.

01:30:35.482 --> 01:30:36.612
LAURA: Go Gunther!

01:30:36.612 --> 01:30:40.822
ASHLEY: Which one did you do the arm wrestling
with, Beau?

01:30:40.822 --> 01:30:43.290
TRAVIS: Have we met Gunther before? Is he human?

01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:45.132
MATT: He looks human. He's just huge.

01:30:47.492 --> 01:30:49.535
TALIESIN: You should take a shot at that.

01:30:50.515 --> 01:30:52.781
ASHLEY: Are you going to take a shot at this,
Fjord?

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:55.802
TRAVIS: (coughing) Me?

01:30:56.522 --> 01:30:57.546
MARISHA: Yeah, you're stronger than me, right?

01:30:57.546 --> 01:30:59.007
LAURA: You're very big and strong, Fjord!

01:30:59.007 --> 01:31:00.494
SAM: No, he's really not.

01:31:00.494 --> 01:31:01.795
TRAVIS: Yeah. You know.

01:31:02.475 --> 01:31:04.447
TALIESIN: At the very least, you have a lot to
prove.

01:31:07.487 --> 01:31:10.387
LIAM: Caleb is going to sneak off while everybody
is involved with this.

01:31:10.387 --> 01:31:16.030
TRAVIS: It's not good to arm wrestle 30 minutes
after eating a caramel apple.

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:18.151
MARISHA: Oh, I never heard that one before.

01:31:18.151 --> 01:31:20.446
SAM: Yasha, you should do it. You're very strong.

01:31:20.446 --> 01:31:23.534
LAURA: Mm-hmm. You had a candied apple. You should
be fine.

01:31:23.534 --> 01:31:25.939
ASHLEY: Extra strong? Because of the candied
apple.

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:26.756
TRAVIS: Your rat diet.

01:31:26.756 --> 01:31:28.565
ASHLEY: I mean, Beau is-- No, he didn't.

01:31:28.565 --> 01:31:30.497
TRAVIS: No, I mean, from in your past.

01:31:31.207 --> 01:31:31.694
ASHLEY: Oh.

01:31:31.694 --> 01:31:36.649
TRAVIS: Good constitution. Yeah, come on. Let them
know.

01:31:37.259 --> 01:31:38.478
LAURA: Do it, Yasha!

01:31:38.478 --> 01:31:42.649
ASHLEY: Are you doing any more of the wrestling
with the arms?

01:31:43.719 --> 01:31:50.446
MATT: Leopold is looking over the crowd, goes,
"Would you like to try your hand at our finest warrior?"

01:31:51.469 --> 01:31:52.417
ASHLEY: Sure.

01:31:52.417 --> 01:31:53.905
MATT: "Come on up, Miss--"

01:31:56.725 --> 01:31:57.628
ASHLEY: (whispers) Yasha.

01:31:58.488 --> 01:32:02.699
MATT: "Miss (whispers) Yasha. (regular volume)
Miss Yasha, our new--"

01:32:02.699 --> 01:32:06.400
(cheering)

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:09.385
MATT: The crowd begins to cheer as you step up
onto the stage. Everyone begins to gather up

01:32:09.385 --> 01:32:13.789
around the space, filling in the outskirts. You
can see all these faces looking up at you,

01:32:13.789 --> 01:32:18.982
bright-eyed and eager to either watch you get
destroyed or destroy. Gunther, who is currently

01:32:18.982 --> 01:32:23.971
standing with his arms crossed sees you approach.
He's a good, over a foot taller than you, and

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:28.769
looks down as you walk towards the table. "Hmm.
All right."

01:32:28.769 --> 01:32:29.507
ASHLEY: Hello.

01:32:29.507 --> 01:32:33.476
MATT: "Hello." Sits down, puts his elbow on the
table with a heavy slam.

01:32:34.746 --> 01:32:35.548
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:32:36.248 --> 01:32:37.904
MATT: Grasps you. Both your arms--

01:32:37.904 --> 01:32:40.194
LAURA: (yelling) Use your feminine wiles!

01:32:40.194 --> 01:32:41.877
TALIESIN: Oh, I wouldn't-- Oh.

01:32:41.877 --> 01:32:43.742
ASHLEY: I shake my hair a little.

01:32:43.742 --> 01:32:45.763
TRAVIS: Yasha, don't hold back.

01:32:45.763 --> 01:32:50.487
MATT: He's taking a moment and looking you over,
like he's studying something.

01:32:50.487 --> 01:32:52.218
ASHLEY: I try not to make eye contact.

01:32:52.218 --> 01:32:55.018
MATT: He's trying to make eye contact. Moving
around.

01:32:55.018 --> 01:33:00.042
ASHLEY: I'm looking down and putting my hair down.
Away.

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:03.835
LAURA: (yelling) Her hair's so beautiful. Woo!

01:33:03.835 --> 01:33:05.828
SAM: I don't think that's helping.

01:33:05.828 --> 01:33:07.230
TRAVIS: Don't look at him.

01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:08.764
SAM: It's not a beauty contest.

01:33:08.764 --> 01:33:14.441
MATT: As Leopold is talking up this whole this
whole, "All right, come watch now! Here is our

01:33:14.441 --> 01:33:19.467
"finest--" and it fades away in the background as
Gunther, who's leaning forward now, says

01:33:19.467 --> 01:33:23.564
"Interesting styling. I've seen it before."

01:33:25.214 --> 01:33:25.956
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

01:33:26.486 --> 01:33:29.110
MATT: "You're not from around here, are you?"

01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:32.508
ASHLEY: Well, neither are you. What does that have
to do with anything?

01:33:32.508 --> 01:33:40.234
MATT: "Nothing. Just an observation. I've been on
the front lines long enough." With that, Leopold

01:33:40.234 --> 01:33:51.726
walks up and goes "Three, two--" Make a strength
check with advantage, because he wasn't expecting it.

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:54.006
(cheering)

01:33:55.186 --> 01:33:55.828
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

01:33:55.828 --> 01:33:57.962
(cheering)

01:33:57.962 --> 01:34:02.753
MATT: Natural 20. No joke. No joke. Right there.

01:34:02.753 --> 01:34:06.533
SAM: Dueling natural 20s? Their arms rip off.
Blood is everywhere.

01:34:07.463 --> 01:34:09.303
LIAM: Fist of the North Star!

01:34:09.303 --> 01:34:12.447
MATT: Beautiful. Beautiful. Mwah.

01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:16.813
ASHLEY: This was thanks to Gil. Shit! What does
that mean?

01:34:16.813 --> 01:34:21.989
MATT: As soon as you do that, he catches it, you
both are caught in the center here, tensing up.

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:27.441
The whole crowd goes "Ooh!" Everything gets really
tense and quiet as you're both flexing. At this

01:34:27.441 --> 01:34:32.020
point now, you do make eye contact. As the anger
is built up inside you. Make another strength check.

01:34:35.251 --> 01:34:36.024
ASHLEY: Fuck.

01:34:36.454 --> 01:34:37.539
TRAVIS: Are you still raging?

01:34:37.539 --> 01:34:38.350
SAM: Oh, yeah.

01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:39.338
MATT: Well, she hasn't raged yet.

01:34:39.338 --> 01:34:42.906
ASHLEY: Can I rage? I don't know if I can do that.

01:34:42.906 --> 01:34:45.652
MATT: Not on this roll you can't, because you
already rolled for it. Next time you can.

01:34:45.652 --> 01:34:47.833
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do it on the next one. Okay.
Seven.

01:34:47.833 --> 01:34:53.373
MATT: Seven. You feel yourself giving way, your
arm going further back towards the table. You see

01:34:53.373 --> 01:35:01.362
this grin across his face. His breath smells of
mildewed bread and alcohol. It wafts past your

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.334
nose. Roll a strength check.

01:35:03.714 --> 01:35:09.384
SAM: Matt, may I cast Message and send a message
to Gunther?

01:35:09.384 --> 01:35:10.569
MATT: Gunther, yeah.

01:35:10.569 --> 01:35:18.468
SAM: I'm going to quickly say: Kendall is getting
to second base with your wife right now! Do not

01:35:18.468 --> 01:35:19.966
respond to this message!

01:35:19.966 --> 01:35:22.496
(laughter)

01:35:22.496 --> 01:35:24.417
MATT: You get to roll another strength check with
advantage.

01:35:25.477 --> 01:35:29.690
ASHLEY: Okay. How far away is everybody from us?

01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:33.978
MATT: They're down like two and a half, three
feet, because you guys are on a raised platform.

01:35:33.978 --> 01:35:35.596
They're about five feet from you.

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:37.140
ASHLEY: Oh shit. Okay. Never mind.

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:37.794
SAM: Oh shit.

01:35:39.224 --> 01:35:40.042
LAURA: With advantage!

01:35:40.042 --> 01:35:41.754
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

01:35:41.754 --> 01:35:42.731
TALIESIN: You get to roll again.

01:35:42.731 --> 01:35:43.951
MATT: Because you are raging.

01:35:45.431 --> 01:35:46.264
ASHLEY: 21.

01:35:47.224 --> 01:35:52.221
MATT: As he's pushing you down towards the table,
you muster up another breath of strength from

01:35:52.221 --> 01:35:57.087
inside. With that, you push him back to the
center. You're both at even keel. Roll again.

01:35:57.447 --> 01:35:58.167
ASHLEY: With advantage?

01:35:58.167 --> 01:35:59.053
MATT: With advantage.

01:35:59.513 --> 01:36:07.053
ASHLEY: This is very stressful. Okay. 21.

01:36:08.523 --> 01:36:14.000
MATT: (grunt) He starts giving ground, the sweat
now beading across his forehead. His nostrils are

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.560
flaring. That horrible smell of his breath is
coming in bigger and more constant waves as he

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:24.905
starts to (grunt). He looks up from his grip, up
into your eyes once more. Roll again.

01:36:24.905 --> 01:36:26.902
SAM and LAURA: Finish him!

01:36:31.512 --> 01:36:40.530
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh shit. (stammering)
I can't do math right nowbecause I'm stressed. 14.

01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:47.026
MATT: 14. He slowly brings you back up to the
center. Roll again. The crowd, each time the shift

01:36:47.026 --> 01:36:50.198
happens, the crowd is like, "Ooh! Ah! Oh god!"

01:36:51.488 --> 01:36:54.392
ASHLEY. Shit! Ten.

01:36:58.242 --> 01:37:01.541
MATT: You're losing ground. You're losing ground!
Roll again.

01:37:05.501 --> 01:37:08.158
ASHLEY: No! 14.

01:37:08.158 --> 01:37:19.144
MATT: 14? (grunt) He rolled a seven plus five.
Right up at the center. Roll again! The crowd is

01:37:19.144 --> 01:37:20.727
going wild right now.

01:37:20.727 --> 01:37:22.060
ASHLEY: Oh no.

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.333
MATT: Leopold's like leaning in now, watching this
happen.

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:26.237
MARISHA and LAURA: (chanting) Yasha! Yasha!

01:37:26.237 --> 01:37:26.769
ASHLEY: 17.

01:37:29.489 --> 01:37:31.942
MATT: (grunt) Pushing him back. Roll again!

01:37:33.232 --> 01:37:36.656
MATT: This is going back and forth, back and
forth. (laughter)

01:37:36.656 --> 01:37:37.930
LIAM: Put him in the body bag!

01:37:37.930 --> 01:37:39.256
MARISHA: Give him the chair!

01:37:39.256 --> 01:37:39.698
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:37:39.698 --> 01:37:41.662
LIAM and LAURA: Advantage!

01:37:43.212 --> 01:37:43.683
ASHLEY: 22.

01:37:44.283 --> 01:37:51.905
MATT: 22. He pushes you right back in the center.
Rolled an 18. You guys are right there again. At

01:37:51.905 --> 01:37:55.284
the fulcrum point. The crowd is starting to go
completely breathless at this point. It's back and

01:37:55.284 --> 01:37:56.699
forth. Roll again.

01:37:56.699 --> 01:38:00.131
LAURA: One of them is going to have exhaustion
soon, I know it!

01:38:00.131 --> 01:38:01.792
MATT: He's starting to breathe really heavy.

01:38:02.722 --> 01:38:03.250
ASHLEY: 21.

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:07.579
MATT: 21. You push him back again. You can see
now, the muscles are straining and popping, the

01:38:07.579 --> 01:38:11.786
veins are bulging. His breaths are getting
heavier, his shoulder is looking like it's almost

01:38:11.786 --> 01:38:14.541
dislodging as he's using his torso to push against
it. Roll once more.

01:38:14.541 --> 01:38:16.420
SAM: Jester! Should I shoot him?.

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:20.524
LAURA: (yelling) No! No! No! Rip his arm off,
Yasha! Don't shoot him!

01:38:21.494 --> 01:38:24.674
ASHLEY: Okay. 19.

01:38:24.674 --> 01:38:27.239
MATT: (grunt) (bang of arm against table)

01:38:27.239 --> 01:38:31.509
(cheering)

01:38:31.509 --> 01:38:34.151
MATT: He immediately stands up and starts shaking
his arm at that point.

01:38:34.151 --> 01:38:36.155
ASHLEY: Immediately when I slam him, I get up and
walk off.

01:38:36.155 --> 01:38:37.563
(cheering)

01:38:37.563 --> 01:38:45.453
MATT: Leopold goes, "Amazing show. Yasha!" and he
runs up behind you and catches up to you. As you

01:38:45.453 --> 01:38:51.158
step off the stage, he steps off with you. Goes
"I'm sorry to bother you, Yasha. That was an

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:53.756
"incredible-- Have you any interest in all at
joining the ranks of the Righteous Brand?"

01:38:53.756 --> 01:38:54.301
ASHLEY: No.

01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:58.687
MATT: "Oh. Well, think about it." He goes into the
small satchel and pulls out at rolled piece of

01:38:58.687 --> 01:39:04.939
paper, and says "It's a fantastic thing you would
do for the Empire if everyone here-- You look like

01:39:04.939 --> 01:39:09.094
"a fine soldier and based on your skills up there
you'd be a great help on the front line."

01:39:09.094 --> 01:39:18.429
ASHLEY: Oh. I don't. Okay. I will take this with
me. I don't like groups of people working together

01:39:18.429 --> 01:39:26.064
for a cause. I will take it with me. I walk away.

01:39:26.064 --> 01:39:28.657
LAURA: Did she win anything? Did she get a prize?

01:39:28.657 --> 01:39:33.228
MATT: Strangely enough, there is no prize for
this. There is no buy-in. It's merely for the

01:39:33.228 --> 01:39:35.874
bragging rights of the presentation. It's a
presentory--

01:39:35.874 --> 01:39:37.847
LAURA: (yelling) Lame!

01:39:39.737 --> 01:39:40.479
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:39:41.489 --> 01:39:46.591
MARISHA: Hey Yasha, check it out, I got one too.
It's a really shitty prize, though.

01:39:46.591 --> 01:39:48.649
ASHLEY: What does it-- did you look at it yet?

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:49.097
MARISHA: No.

01:39:49.097 --> 01:39:52.098
LAURA: I bet yours says, "Please don't ever
contact us again."

01:39:52.098 --> 01:39:53.733
MARISHA: Oh, what dicks!

01:39:53.733 --> 01:39:55.218
MATT: No, it talks about--

01:39:55.218 --> 01:39:56.814
ASHLEY: Can you read it for me?

01:39:56.814 --> 01:39:57.346
MATT: Okay.

01:39:58.736 --> 01:39:59.583
MARISHA: It says--

01:39:59.583 --> 01:40:01.272
MATT: As you read it--

01:40:01.272 --> 01:40:04.269
(laughter)

01:40:04.269 --> 01:40:05.739
SAM: No, I think this is for Marisha.

01:40:05.739 --> 01:40:10.887
LIAM: Do that, speak at the same time-- hear ye
hear ye.

01:40:10.887 --> 01:40:15.223
MATT: No. It speaks of the Righteous Brand and
talks about all of the wonderful possibilities for

01:40:15.223 --> 01:40:21.728
glory. It's housing and gear provided, it's
working in a good teamwork environment to protect

01:40:21.728 --> 01:40:27.049
the people of the Empire. It has opportunities to
rise through the ranks and to become--

01:40:27.049 --> 01:40:28.157
MARISHA: It's propaganda.

01:40:28.157 --> 01:40:32.871
MATT: It talks about-- it pays one gold a day at
start, with possibility of raises from there. The

01:40:32.871 --> 01:40:38.537
training is in Bladegarden and after a period of
training there, it's three years minimum service

01:40:38.537 --> 01:40:44.078
in the military and then you can decide to stay or
not. It goes into a small print and says like

01:40:44.078 --> 01:40:46.306
"desertion is illegal and brings imprisonment and
fines."

01:40:46.306 --> 01:40:47.068
MARISHA: Oh.

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:48.512
TRAVIS: The ushe.

01:40:49.482 --> 01:40:53.816
LAURA: A gold a day, that's pretty good. Right? Is
it?

01:40:53.816 --> 01:40:57.787
MARISHA: I mean, if you're only training, they
send you to the frontline and it's questionable.

01:40:57.787 --> 01:41:02.004
TALIESIN: I think I've literally made 200 gold
since we've met, minimum, at this point. It's been

01:41:02.004 --> 01:41:02.946
like a week.

01:41:02.946 --> 01:41:04.064
LAURA: I mean, we've been making a good amount.

01:41:04.064 --> 01:41:05.829
ASHLEY: Nott, do you want mine? Just in case, if
you want to join?

01:41:05.829 --> 01:41:06.476
SAM: I'll take it.

01:41:07.176 --> 01:41:10.792
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation
there's a voice from the side that goes, "That was

01:41:10.792 --> 01:41:16.215
"quite an amazing display, if I say so myself." As
you turn and look you see there's a gentleman

01:41:16.215 --> 01:41:21.679
there who's tall, a little over six foot, very--
<i>a</i> gentleman, not <i>the</i> Gentleman.

01:41:22.699 --> 01:41:25.539
LAURA: No, that's not what I was going for, I
wanted to know what he looks like.

01:41:25.539 --> 01:41:33.104
MATT: He's a very strong looking human male with
ruddy, tan skin and long, jet black hair that's

01:41:33.104 --> 01:41:37.913
braided in a single thick braid that goes past his
waist in the back. He's dressed in partial

01:41:37.913 --> 01:41:45.107
scalemail across the chest and part of the
shoulders, a dull iron color to it that's over his

01:41:45.107 --> 01:41:50.501
chest. You see a heavy waistband of dull gray
leather that's like a thick, almost a foot thick

01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:55.562
piece around there and a rough-looking warhammer
that's strapped to his side and he has his arms

01:41:55.562 --> 01:42:00.779
crossed and smiling widely at you with a very
welcoming smile. "That was impressive. That guy

01:42:00.779 --> 01:42:03.174
"you just destroyed up there? He's kind of a
douche."

01:42:03.704 --> 01:42:04.717
ASHLEY: I could tell.

01:42:07.227 --> 01:42:08.682
MATT: "What's your purpose here? Are you looking
for work?"

01:42:09.742 --> 01:42:10.455
ASHLEY Me or--?

01:42:11.435 --> 01:42:11.973
MATT: "Yes, you."

01:42:13.483 --> 01:42:17.462
ASHLEY: I mean, it depends on what kind of work, I
guess.

01:42:17.462 --> 01:42:19.125
MATT: "Well, mercenary work, of course."

01:42:19.125 --> 01:42:20.808
ASHLEY: Oh, well yeah.

01:42:20.808 --> 01:42:23.164
MATT: "All right, well, first off, my name is
Darrow."

01:42:23.164 --> 01:42:24.295
ASHLEY: Hello Darrow.

01:42:24.295 --> 01:42:25.835
MATT: "What's your name? Yasha, you said?"

01:42:25.835 --> 01:42:26.543
ASHLEY: My name is Yasha.

01:42:26.543 --> 01:42:33.041
MATT: "All right, pleasure to meet you. Well, I am
the de facto leader of a mercenary band known as

01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:39.033
"the Stubborn Stock. We're out of Guar on the
Menagerie Coast, but we've been hired for about a

01:42:39.033 --> 01:42:43.286
"seven month stint so far by the Empire and it's
been paying pretty well. We've had some pretty

01:42:43.286 --> 01:42:49.952
"good scenarios here. The retainer's been nice and
honestly, it's not bad to be paid to sit around in

01:42:49.952 --> 01:42:51.227
"case they need us."

01:42:51.707 --> 01:42:56.463
ASHLEY: What kind of work? It's just going out and
killing things?

01:42:57.273 --> 01:43:01.296
MATT: "Well, when they need us. To kill things, to
hunt things down. There's a lot of business that

01:43:01.296 --> 01:43:04.249
"they can't bring the military to and the
Crownsguard stay in the cities so they send us out

01:43:04.249 --> 01:43:07.035
"and about. That's only if they need us."

01:43:07.035 --> 01:43:09.567
ASHLEY: It's no contract? You can come and go as
you please if you like?

01:43:09.567 --> 01:43:13.042
MATT: "Well, it's contract. You have to be there
for their disposal. We're stationed up in Nogvurot

01:43:13.042 --> 01:43:18.855
"and have been for the length of this contract, but
we were able to come down for this celebration and

01:43:18.855 --> 01:43:23.916
"it's been not too bad. It's good wage, sit around,
occasionally hunt down some criminal Xhorhasian

01:43:23.916 --> 01:43:29.282
"terror that's come down from the mountains. It's a
pretty decent living if I say so myself and you

01:43:29.282 --> 01:43:32.904
"look like a very capable soldier if I say,
again."

01:43:33.724 --> 01:43:36.773
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, you can say so.

01:43:37.233 --> 01:43:38.662
MATT: "Sure. Would you be interested?"

01:43:40.212 --> 01:43:44.051
ASHLEY: Maybe. I don't know. Do you have like a
pamphlet or something?

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:52.000
MATT: (laughter) "We have no pamphlet. My band of
esteemed warriors are planning to be in the

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.951
"Victory Pit later this afternoon."

01:43:53.951 --> 01:43:54.990
LAURA: (gasps) The Victory Pit!

01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:58.457
MATT: "We could very much use an additional
soldier of your capability."

01:43:58.457 --> 01:44:01.275
ASHLEY: We were actually thinking of going that
way.

01:44:01.275 --> 01:44:03.687
TRAVIS: I'm afraid she's spoken for.

01:44:03.687 --> 01:44:08.006
MATT: He turns and looks and seemingly for the
first time notices the rest of your group. Goes

01:44:08.006 --> 01:44:13.630
like "Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I mean no
disrespect-- hi-- but I do not understand that. I

01:44:13.630 --> 01:44:17.621
"do not wish to step on any toes here, it was
merely a curiosity. What are you called?"

01:44:20.231 --> 01:44:21.960
LAURA: The Mighty Nein.

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.422
SAM: To travel incognito, but--

01:44:23.422 --> 01:44:24.152
LAURA: Just kidding.

01:44:24.152 --> 01:44:26.091
ASHLEY: The Mighty Nein.

01:44:26.091 --> 01:44:28.085
MATT: "The Mighty Nein. Very good."

01:44:28.085 --> 01:44:32.209
MARISHA: We're Yasha's booker. It's like her
agency.

01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:36.167
ASHLEY: They're all actually very, very strong and
very tough. So--

01:44:36.167 --> 01:44:39.662
SAM: Yeah! I won this doll before!

01:44:39.662 --> 01:44:47.120
MATT: He looks like-- "That's impressive. That's a
good find. Good on you. You know who that's

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:47.946
"supposed to be?"

01:44:47.946 --> 01:44:49.841
SAM: The king or something?

01:44:49.841 --> 01:44:53.120
MATT: "I was going to say a tiny asshole. One and
the same, really."

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.869
LAURA: Wait, I heard you say you were from
Nogvurot, yes?

01:44:56.869 --> 01:45:00.869
MATT: "Well, we're stationed in Nogvurot, but
we're from a ways further than that."

01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:06.454
LAURA: Did you notice any of the kids that were
missing up there?

01:45:08.234 --> 01:45:14.299
MATT: (sighs) "That has been an occasional
problem, yes. We had been sent to investigate two

01:45:14.299 --> 01:45:21.512
"of those instances and in all of them it seemed to
be that they were stolen-- I'm sorry, I do not

01:45:21.512 --> 01:45:24.145
"know how much I can discuss of these with you--"

01:45:24.145 --> 01:45:27.167
LAURA: Oh! We're really good at keeping secrets!

01:45:27.167 --> 01:45:31.056
MATT: Make a general charisma check. Just to see
if he trusts your face.

01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:34.763
TRAVIS: Oh boy. Do I trust your face?

01:45:34.763 --> 01:45:38.151
LAURA: Well, let's general charisma check-- oh,
that would be a natural one there.

01:45:38.151 --> 01:45:41.429
TRAVIS: Yeah! All right!

01:45:41.429 --> 01:45:49.820
MATT: "We've looked into it. Do not worry. But we'll see 
how long the contract goes. I do not

01:45:49.882 --> 01:45:53.181
"know how much luck we'll have. It's kind of a dire
situation."

01:45:53.181 --> 01:45:54.935
LAURA: Is that what you're being paid for up
there?

01:45:54.935 --> 01:45:56.260
MATT: "One of many things."

01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:57.514
LAURA: Wow.

01:45:57.514 --> 01:46:00.278
ASHLEY: You said you've been fighting on the
frontlines of Xhorhas, or--

01:46:00.278 --> 01:46:04.820
MATT: "Well, not yet. Not yet. Just the ones that
come too close in. There've been a few excursions

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:09.248
"into the Empire itself and that's why we're hired.
They're basically bringing everyone they can on

01:46:09.248 --> 01:46:12.863
"hand to help keep the home fort defended."

01:46:12.863 --> 01:46:14.709
ASHLEY: What are you fighting, if I may ask?

01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:17.246
MATT: "What am I fighting? Right now?"

01:46:17.246 --> 01:46:20.147
ASHLEY: Well, in Xhorhas. If you go out there.

01:46:20.147 --> 01:46:21.646
MATT: "Oh, we haven't been to Xhorhas yet."

01:46:21.646 --> 01:46:22.854
ASHLEY: You haven't been to Xhorhas.

01:46:22.854 --> 01:46:23.826
MATT: "They've kept us in the Empire so far."

01:46:23.826 --> 01:46:24.865
ASHLEY: They've kept you in the Empire.

01:46:24.865 --> 01:46:27.917
MATT: "Yeah. They keep the army on the eastern
side, but we're meant to find things that the army

01:46:27.917 --> 01:46:29.717
"cannot be bothered to do."

01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:31.497
ASHLEY: I understand.

01:46:31.497 --> 01:46:33.469
TRAVIS: You've fought in this Victory Pit before?

01:46:33.469 --> 01:46:38.160
MATT: "No, actually. We've only really been in the
Empire for the first time this past half year and

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:43.305
"I've heard things about it and, you know, figured
we'd come and try it. They gave us a week off to

01:46:43.506 --> 01:46:48.750
"come down here to Zadash, and me and my friends are
going to take our best attempt at this."

01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:50.839
LAURA: How many people are in your group?

01:46:50.839 --> 01:46:58.627
MATT: "Oh, well, within our person-- including
myself, a grand total of six mighty warriors."

01:46:58.627 --> 01:47:00.170
LAURA: Whoa.

01:47:00.170 --> 01:47:01.629
MARISHA: All six of you fight?

01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:04.931
MATT: "All six of us have our different techniques,
yes."

01:47:04.978 --> 01:47:08.129
LAURA: What kind of techniques, just in case,
you know, we have to fight you?

01:47:08.129 --> 01:47:16.180
MATT: (laughter) "I'm not going to tell you, and it's
not that kind of tournament. Anyway, I do not mean

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:19.982
"to be a problem. If ever you change your mind--"

01:47:19.997 --> 01:47:24.370
MARISHA: Is it the Gauntlet? Yeah, I know, what is
it?

01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:26.803
LAURA: We have to go sign up for this.

01:47:26.867 --> 01:47:31.909
MATT: He pulls out a copper coin that's a little larger
than a normal piece of copper and goes, "Just ask around."

01:47:31.969 --> 01:47:39.082
He tosses it to you and you take it. It looks like
a small copper platter, coin-ish in its design, and

01:47:39.082 --> 01:47:43.392
on it is printed the name of his group, the
Stubborn Stock.

01:47:43.442 --> 01:47:45.939
SAM: They've got business cards? That is so cool.

01:47:45.939 --> 01:47:47.091
LAURA: We need to get coins.

01:47:47.091 --> 01:47:48.483
MARISHA: We need coins, yeah.

01:47:48.483 --> 01:47:50.007
SAM: We need something.

01:47:50.075 --> 01:47:52.714
ASHLEY: How do I-- what? Do I show it around
or--?

01:47:52.714 --> 01:47:58.032
MATT: "Well, look for any place in a city where we
might be or might not be and see if you've heard

01:47:58.032 --> 01:48:02.378
"of us in the vicinity. If they know where we are,
they'll bring you to us. If they don't, they will not."

01:48:02.378 --> 01:48:05.961
LAURA: Where did you get those coins?

01:48:05.961 --> 01:48:07.840
MATT: "One of our fellows makes them."

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.889
LAURA: You have a blacksmith in the thing?!

01:48:09.889 --> 01:48:14.292
MATT: "Loosely." He takes it and shows it off.
It's not made that well. He goes, "It's functional

01:48:14.292 --> 01:48:16.032
"more than it's beautiful."

01:48:16.032 --> 01:48:17.660
ASHLEY: I think it's great, you know.

01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:18.847
MATT: "I appreciate that."

01:48:18.847 --> 01:48:20.000
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.063
MATT: "All right, anyway. We have to go prepare
for this tournament. If you're standing around,

01:48:24.063 --> 01:48:26.000
"please come cheer us on. That would be
fantastic."

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.617
LAURA: We need to go sign up for the tournament.

01:48:27.617 --> 01:48:28.706
SAM: Absolutely, right now.

01:48:28.706 --> 01:48:30.057
MATT: "A pleasure to meet you, Mighty Nein!"

01:48:30.057 --> 01:48:31.658
LAURA: You too, Darrow!

01:48:31.658 --> 01:48:35.243
MATT: He heads off, back towards the Victory Pit.

01:48:35.243 --> 01:48:40.894
MARISHA: Which we awkwardly go in the same
direction. It's like when you say bye and then

01:48:40.894 --> 01:48:45.642
"Oh, are we--? Okay, we wait 30 seconds. One,
two--"

01:48:45.642 --> 01:48:51.287
SAM: While we're waiting, can I just say, why did
we not think about branding? We should have coins,

01:48:51.287 --> 01:48:58.714
cards, you should be writing a big nine on a wall
wherever we go! Like everywhere, just tagging it,

01:48:58.714 --> 01:49:00.035
just everywhere!

01:49:00.035 --> 01:49:01.711
LAURA: Why a nine though?

01:49:01.711 --> 01:49:03.145
SAM: Because we're the Mighty Nein.

01:49:03.145 --> 01:49:05.169
LAURA: I thought the nine meant that--

01:49:05.169 --> 01:49:09.305
SAM: I know! They don't know that. When you say it
out loud, it's much easier that our symbol is the

01:49:09.305 --> 01:49:11.024
number nine, don't you think?

01:49:11.024 --> 01:49:14.558
TALIESIN: I think that if I saw lots of random
nines around the city I don't think I'd know what

01:49:14.558 --> 01:49:15.727
that was connected to.

01:49:15.727 --> 01:49:17.704
SAM: If you <i>did</i> know, then you'd be one of
the cool kids.

01:49:17.766 --> 01:49:19.419
MARISHA: If you saw random mimes?

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:25.004
LAURA: I'm going to start practicing making a cool
logo for us in my sketchbook.

01:49:25.065 --> 01:49:28.203
LIAM: I am on an errand.

01:49:28.203 --> 01:49:29.530
MATT: What errand are you on?

01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:31.664
LIAM: Oh, well, I'll wait until they wind down,
perhaps.

01:49:31.664 --> 01:49:32.709
SAM: That could be a while.

01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:36.853
LIAM: It could be a while. Well, back at the
Righteous Brand when I snuck out, would it be

01:49:36.853 --> 01:49:41.378
possible for me to find an alleyway or somewhere
secluded so I can cast Disguise Self on myself?

01:49:41.378 --> 01:49:43.364
Around myself, not as myself.

01:49:43.364 --> 01:49:46.428
MATT: Yeah, a short jaunt. Not too hard to find a
darkened corner where you can do it.

01:49:46.428 --> 01:49:52.867
LIAM: Yeah, okay. Then I would like to look
exactly like I do, however, the clothing that I'm

01:49:52.931 --> 01:49:58.219
wearing is a shade of blue that is similar, but
not identical, to the robes that I have seen

01:49:58.219 --> 01:50:06.880
people from the library of the Cobalt Soul. A
similar blue and very large coke bottle glasses.

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:13.593
My eyes go all fish-eyed. Everything else is the
same.

01:50:13.593 --> 01:50:15.403
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to do.

01:50:15.403 --> 01:50:19.373
LIAM: I would like to find one of those people who
was dressed like they came from that library that

01:50:19.373 --> 01:50:21.117
I saw that day with Beauregard.

01:50:21.117 --> 01:50:26.616
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check as you
begin to pore through the crowd doing this. You

01:50:26.616 --> 01:50:28.731
guys have noticed that Caleb's been gone for a
little bit.

01:50:28.731 --> 01:50:31.752
LIAM: It's investigation, you said?

01:50:31.752 --> 01:50:32.647
MATT: Yes.

01:50:32.647 --> 01:50:33.946
LIAM: It's a 24.

01:50:33.946 --> 01:50:37.809
MATT: Wow, yeah. Within a very short time,
asking a few questions and looking through part of

01:50:37.809 --> 01:50:44.400
the crowd, one of them points over to the edge of
the Pentamarket on the northern side, and over in

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:52.089
that direction there are two of the robe-wearing
individuals. One of the monks that works within

01:50:52.089 --> 01:51:00.261
the archive itself and one looks to be wearing
higher up robes. You're not sure what that means

01:51:00.261 --> 01:51:02.230
or what the ranking is within the Cobalt Soul.

01:51:02.230 --> 01:51:03.646
LIAM: I would like to approach them.

01:51:03.646 --> 01:51:04.941
MATT: All right, as you approach--

01:51:04.941 --> 01:51:09.514
LIAM: Yeah. Excuse me! I'm sorry. May I trouble
you for a moment? I know this is untoward in the

01:51:09.514 --> 01:51:11.192
middle of a festival.

01:51:11.192 --> 01:51:18.532
MATT: The one that's in the nicer dress you can
see is apparently an elven woman. You see these

01:51:18.532 --> 01:51:23.339
kind of long strands of blond, almost silver hair
that goes in front of the ears and the rest of the

01:51:23.339 --> 01:51:30.387
hair falls past the shoulders. Beautiful, natural,
no makeup. Even for elven standards, you can see a

01:51:30.387 --> 01:51:35.286
little bit of age. This is an older elf in
comparison to a lot of the brighter faces that

01:51:35.286 --> 01:51:38.803
turns to you. "Of course, what can we help you
with?"

01:51:38.803 --> 01:51:45.378
LIAM: Oh, yeah. Again, I am very sorry. I am a
traveling writer. I am writing a history of the

01:51:45.378 --> 01:51:52.366
great cities of the Empire and I have heard
wonderful things about the library that is under

01:51:52.366 --> 01:51:57.684
your stead and I don't know-- I have viewed it
from the outside, it is a beautiful structure, but

01:51:57.684 --> 01:52:05.432
I don't know what it entails to visit it. I was
wondering, do you allow outsiders? I don't know if

01:52:05.432 --> 01:52:12.530
it costs a fee or if you need some sort of letter
of recommendation, but I am very eager to learn

01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:18.043
about the library itself and the city and
everything that I can learn about it so I can

01:52:18.043 --> 01:52:22.645
write more extensive-- it would just mean so much
to me.

01:52:22.645 --> 01:52:24.380
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:25.837
LIAM: It's all true, though.

01:52:25.837 --> 01:52:27.727
MATT: Well.

01:52:27.727 --> 01:52:34.273
LIAM: (laughs) It is a 13.

01:52:34.273 --> 01:52:47.089
MATT: A 13? Okay. "Well, of course. It is open to
the public. You're required to come when there is

01:52:47.089 --> 01:52:52.409
"an available monk to escort you through the
premises. Of course, you cannot take anything from

01:52:52.409 --> 01:52:59.429
"the archive itself, but you're welcome to read
while in the presence of one of our various monks

01:52:59.429 --> 01:53:01.686
"and/or worshippers of the Knowing Mistress."

01:53:01.686 --> 01:53:03.174
LIAM: The entire library?

01:53:03.174 --> 01:53:05.325
MATT: "Well, the public portions of it, yes."

01:53:05.325 --> 01:53:06.481
LIAM: Oh, of course.

01:53:06.481 --> 01:53:11.713
MATT: "Yes. Just need to come on a day in which
the archive is open and available, sign in, and

01:53:11.713 --> 01:53:17.728
"you will be assigned one of our various attendees
of the archive and you will have the run of the

01:53:17.728 --> 01:53:23.455
"public library of which to read and make notes of.
You may take your own copy of notes, but once, of

01:53:23.455 --> 01:53:26.023
"course, it is only within the public space."

01:53:26.023 --> 01:53:28.124
LIAM: It is far simpler than I had imagined.

01:53:28.124 --> 01:53:29.661
MATT: "Yeah. Well, I'm glad you asked."

01:53:29.661 --> 01:53:33.762
LIAM: Thank you so much. Forgive me, this is
forward. What is your name?

01:53:33.762 --> 01:53:35.163
MATT: "I'm Jennah. Archivist Jennah."

01:53:35.163 --> 01:53:42.872
LIAM: It is a pleasure. This is a different
subject almost entirely, but I was wondering, I

01:53:42.872 --> 01:53:48.816
mean to make a stop at all the great libraries of
this city. I was wondering, is it a similar

01:53:48.816 --> 01:53:51.224
situation at the Hall of Erudition?

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:58.400
MATT: "They are a little different. They maintain
their knowledge for those who are actually there

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.020
"as part of the curriculum. You'll have to speak to
the headmaster as well. They have, from what we

01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:13.210
"know, as we are not allowed either, quite a decent
cache of arcane knowledge as well. There has been

01:54:13.210 --> 01:54:15.203
"some sharing, but they are particular."

01:54:15.203 --> 01:54:16.874
LIAM: What was the headmaster's name?

01:54:16.874 --> 01:54:27.070
MATT: "That would be Ornit, I believe." Let me
double check here so I don't say it wrong. No,

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:30.396
that is, no, "Oremid Hass."

01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:31.790
LIAM: Oremid Hass.

01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:33.115
MATT: "Yes."

01:54:33.115 --> 01:54:35.893
LIAM: Oremid Haas is running the Halls of
Erudition?

01:54:35.941 --> 01:54:37.024
MATT: "Yes."

01:54:37.024 --> 01:54:45.970
LIAM: Okay. Apropos of nothing, I have heard about
this tower attack. That's terrible.

01:54:45.970 --> 01:54:51.507
MATT: "Yes, that was a bit disconcerting,
definitely. Thankfully, it is a well-defended

01:54:51.507 --> 01:54:59.868
"tower. The Zauber Spire has stood for quite some
time and has its capabilities defending itself as

01:54:59.868 --> 01:55:01.119
"we've seen."

01:55:01.119 --> 01:55:02.415
LIAM: I'm amazed it did not fall.

01:55:02.415 --> 01:55:06.905
MATT: "Well, you should ask them how they did
that. You'll know as to why they're so secretive."

01:55:06.905 --> 01:55:08.915
LIAM: Do they accept-- oh, no, they don't accept
visitors there.

01:55:08.915 --> 01:55:17.303
MATT: "Well, I don't know. We always go on
specific business, so you can certainly inquire. I

01:55:17.303 --> 01:55:21.476
"haven't attempted to go from the standpoint of a
possible student, but you could ask."

01:55:21.476 --> 01:55:24.268
LIAM: Well, I have taken up enough of your time.

01:55:24.268 --> 01:55:25.881
MATT: "That is all right."

01:55:25.881 --> 01:55:29.368
LIAM: I'd like to say thank you. Have a wonderful
festival.

01:55:29.368 --> 01:55:32.039
MATT: "Of course. You as well. Happy Harvest
Close."

01:55:32.039 --> 01:55:34.840
LIAM: I turn a corner and fucking book it.

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:48.037
MATT: As you return to the rest of the group, you
guys are met by a strangely adorned Caleb with an

01:55:48.037 --> 01:55:49.431
interesting ensemble.

01:55:49.431 --> 01:55:53.052
LAURA: Got some new specs there.

01:55:53.052 --> 01:55:54.720
LIAM: What do you mean?

01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.206
ASHLEY: What did you just get up to?

01:55:56.206 --> 01:55:57.421
MARISHA: New robes, too.

01:55:57.421 --> 01:56:01.296
LIAM: I was sightseeing.

01:56:01.296 --> 01:56:02.535
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:56:02.535 --> 01:56:04.885
LAURA: Do you need those and we never knew?

01:56:04.885 --> 01:56:06.769
LIAM: Where are we right now?

01:56:06.769 --> 01:56:10.277
MATT: You guys are on the outside of the Victory
Pit. The crowds are starting to swarm into a

01:56:10.277 --> 01:56:12.077
central archway that's open.

01:56:12.077 --> 01:56:13.972
LIAM: Are they all around us or are we off to the
side?

01:56:13.972 --> 01:56:17.310
MATT: Right now you are in part of the crowd as
the people are rushing past.

01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:24.134
LIAM: Okay, so I lean down to tie my shoe and let
the cloak fall around me, and I get down between

01:56:24.134 --> 01:56:27.198
Yasha and Fjord, and when I come up everything is
back to normal.

01:56:27.198 --> 01:56:31.543
LAURA: Your glasses fell off when you were bent
over.

01:56:31.543 --> 01:56:35.070
LIAM: It gives me a headache, so I took them off.

01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:36.660
TRAVIS: Where were you at?

01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:41.186
LIAM: Exactly what I was saying. I was
sightseeing, I was asking about their libraries of

01:56:41.186 --> 01:56:43.193
the city.

01:56:43.193 --> 01:56:44.605
TRAVIS: Lots of them around here?

01:56:44.605 --> 01:56:46.500
LIAM: Not so many.

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:49.258
MARISHA: Cobalt's a good color on you.

01:56:49.258 --> 01:56:50.661
LIAM: What?

01:56:50.661 --> 01:56:51.940
MARISHA: You look good in blue.

01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:53.699
LIAM: (sniffs)

01:56:53.699 --> 01:56:56.806
TRAVIS: Okay, shall we go into the Victory Pit?

01:56:56.806 --> 01:56:58.718
LAURA: Yeah, let's sign up!

01:56:58.718 --> 01:57:09.542
MATT: You guys gather your strength, your
interest, your nerve. You go in with the rest of

01:57:09.542 --> 01:57:13.729
the crowd that is now beginning to gather towards
the front end of the Victory Pit. As you step

01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:19.011
towards the central archway into the shaded
interior of the main entryway, we're going to take

01:57:19.011 --> 01:57:25.532
a break! We'll be back here in a few minutes to
pick up to this tournament and all that it entails.

01:57:25.532 --> 01:57:27.468
SAM: Aw, man. What a festival!

01:57:27.468 --> 01:57:29.829
LAURA: What a festival!

01:57:29.829 --> 01:57:38.961
MATT: Tonight as part of our Wyrmwood giveaway, we
have a bocote tabletop dice tray from our friends

01:57:38.961 --> 01:57:43.120
at Wyrmwood. Very fancy leather interior, it's
very pretty.

01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:44.885
LAURA: Aren't those the same kind--

01:57:44.885 --> 01:57:51.472
MATT: That is, actually yes. You can have Jester's
dice box, kind of. Tonight, the keyword is

01:57:51.472 --> 01:57:56.476
"celebration." If you'd like to, come into the
Twitch chat and enter the word "celebration" to

01:57:56.476 --> 01:58:01.878
become part of the drawing, as long as you are in
the US and Canada outside of Quebec, otherwise you

01:58:01.878 --> 01:58:07.054
cannot enter. I am very sorry, laws are weird.
Enter it only once. Any more than that and you may

01:58:07.054 --> 01:58:10.767
be disqualified. We will come back at the end of the
break with a winner to be announced. Until then,

01:58:10.826 --> 01:58:12.665
we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.

01:58:12.665 --> 02:11:11.804
[break]

02:11:11.804 --> 02:11:16.514
MATT: You guys are so slow on the draw tonight.
Welcome back, everybody. Before we get kicked back

02:11:16.514 --> 02:11:24.604
in, we have our winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway
tonight which is mumbly_joe1212. Congratulations!

02:11:24.604 --> 02:11:29.664
Danoba will get your information if he hasn't
already, and we'll get that shipped out to you.

02:11:29.664 --> 02:11:38.840
Congrats. Diving back in, folks. You have muscled
your way through the crowd, making your way into

02:11:38.994 --> 02:11:45.930
the shaded interior of the front portion, the
receiving chamber of the Victory Pit, this

02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:53.984
two-leveled circular forum-like structure in the
center of the Pentamarket. You push in the crowd,

02:11:53.984 --> 02:11:58.460
and people are starting to find each other and
push away to find seats into some of the openings

02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:04.275
that lead off to the sides in the center. There is
a pedestal with a barker or an organizer up there

02:12:04.275 --> 02:12:12.064
in a long dark gray and brown set of robes, a
human male in his late 50s who's fighting his own

02:12:12.064 --> 02:12:17.813
age and losing. The comb-over thinning hair and a
broom-like gray mustache that's poorly colored

02:12:17.813 --> 02:12:26.645
with dark wax. He's shouting out to the crowd, he
says, "Please enter slowly, the event begins

02:12:26.645 --> 02:12:32.713
"shortly in the next few hours. Would you push
aside-- (muttering) Yes, right! This way, please,

02:12:32.713 --> 02:12:36.258
"but go evenly!" He's pushing off two different
directions. What are you guys doing?

02:12:36.258 --> 02:12:39.963
LAURA: Should we go in, then? Yes?

02:12:39.963 --> 02:12:41.355
TALIESIN: Oh, I think we are.

02:12:41.355 --> 02:12:43.541
LAURA: Is this where we go if we're going to
fight?

02:12:43.541 --> 02:12:46.934
MATT: "I'm sorry? The fights will be soon."

02:12:46.934 --> 02:12:48.995
LAURA: How do we be one of the fights?

02:12:48.995 --> 02:12:51.879
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'd like to enroll in the
competition.

02:12:51.879 --> 02:12:53.611
MATT: "Oh, you wish to enter?"

02:12:53.611 --> 02:12:54.552
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:12:54.552 --> 02:12:58.968
MATT: "Oh, entry may have already been closed."

02:12:58.968 --> 02:13:06.116
LAURA: Oh no, we're real good! You definitely want
us to be in this. We put on a real good show!

02:13:06.116 --> 02:13:13.145
MATT: "Let me ask." He turns around and steps off
of his pedestal and heads to this wooden door.

02:13:13.145 --> 02:13:19.914
It's about ten feet behind and he shoves through,
closes behind him and slams. A few moments pass

02:13:19.914 --> 02:13:24.495
and people begin filtering through still, pushing
past you and bumping you in the shoulders.

02:13:24.495 --> 02:13:28.812
MARISHA: Hey, what do you think that dude meant
when he said it wasn't like a normal fight?

02:13:28.812 --> 02:13:33.860
LAURA: I don't know. I wonder how experienced
these fighters are? Do you think it's stupid that

02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:36.037
we're signing up for it without knowing much?

02:13:36.037 --> 02:13:37.385
SAM: Yes, very.

02:13:37.385 --> 02:13:40.884
LIAM: I'm also curious. Is it a bare-knuckles
thing, or is no-holds-barred do whatever you want?

02:13:40.884 --> 02:13:45.450
MARISHA: Maybe it's an obstacle course, you know,
Ninja Warrior style.

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:47.283
TRAVIS: Maybe it's like a cook-off.

02:13:47.283 --> 02:13:49.625
TALIESIN: I'd be all right with that.

02:13:49.625 --> 02:13:51.769
LAURA: A cook-off, that is true. It could be.

02:13:51.769 --> 02:13:54.285
MARISHA: Maybe we all sit around and talk about
our feelings.

02:13:54.285 --> 02:13:56.676
LAURA: Fjord, you're really good at making chili.

02:13:56.676 --> 02:13:59.409
MATT: The door opens again across the way as you
guys are having this conversation, and the

02:13:59.409 --> 02:14:03.117
gentleman comes out again and goes, "Quickly,
follow me."

02:14:03.117 --> 02:14:04.473
LAURA: Yes yes yes!

02:14:04.473 --> 02:14:08.892
MATT: You guys make your way through the crowd and
follow him into this back chamber. You enter with

02:14:08.892 --> 02:14:18.172
him. There's a slight hallway that leads into a
low-lit lounge with comfortable furniture with

02:14:18.172 --> 02:14:23.888
cushions, there's some firelight, a few torches
set up in the chamber. There is a window across

02:14:23.888 --> 02:14:32.885
the way that looks out into the open of the
Victory Pit's main battle area. You can see

02:14:32.885 --> 02:14:37.694
servants wandering in similar brown silks and
robes as the barker, but they're carrying trays of

02:14:37.694 --> 02:14:43.374
food. You see guests in expensive clothing that
dot the distant walls and areas of the chamber

02:14:43.374 --> 02:14:48.788
sitting atop these cushioned couches and talking
in low voices to each other, broken with the

02:14:48.788 --> 02:14:55.583
occasional laugh. The older gentleman ushers you
over and waves in the distance as a figure begins

02:14:55.583 --> 02:15:05.064
to approach. This is another human man in probably
his early 60s or so, who has graying hair that is

02:15:05.064 --> 02:15:12.109
slicked back and even further thinned than the
gentleman who first met you on the way in, who has

02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:21.468
a very well groomed goatee that comes to an
accentuated curve up underneath in the front. He's

02:15:21.608 --> 02:15:24.130
wearing a finely tailored dark blue festival
suit.

02:15:24.130 --> 02:15:26.174
MARISHA: Ooh, styling!

02:15:26.174 --> 02:15:31.335
MATT: The barker says, "These are the ones who--"
and the older guy goes, "Ah! It's far too late in

02:15:31.335 --> 02:15:44.894
"the day. We couldn't muster a-- Very well. I am
Yadaka Brigman, Guildhead of the Filigree House

02:15:44.894 --> 02:15:51.840
"and organizer of this harvest tournament. Who are
you, and have you the coin to enter?"

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:56.480
TRAVIS: Well, of course. We are the illustrious
Mighty Nein. Servants of Zadash.

02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.583
MATT: "The Mighty Nein. Where are you from, Mighty
Nein?"

02:15:59.583 --> 02:16:01.184
TRAVIS: All parts.

02:16:01.184 --> 02:16:04.254
LAURA: All over. Everywhere and nowhere.

02:16:04.254 --> 02:16:06.275
LIAM: DM, could you say that crazy-ass name
again?

02:16:06.275 --> 02:16:11.225
MATT: Yadaka Brigman. "You are from everywhere."

02:16:11.263 --> 02:16:12.353
LAURA: Yes.

02:16:12.505 --> 02:16:14.687
MATT: "You will be announced as from everywhere."

02:16:14.687 --> 02:16:17.844
LAURA: That's good. We are from lots of places,
after all.

02:16:17.844 --> 02:16:19.498
MARISHA: Yeah, makes us feel very worldly.

02:16:19.498 --> 02:16:26.779
MATT: "That's all right if that is what you
require. All right! Well, we've warriors from

02:16:26.779 --> 02:16:32.471
"around the Marrow Valley come to compete today,
many of which who'll have been on the front lines

02:16:32.471 --> 02:16:35.896
"of the eastern wastes. Are you still eager to lose
your coin and risk your life?"

02:16:35.896 --> 02:16:39.683
TRAVIS: I forget. Refresh my memory about what the
fee is for entering this contest.

02:16:39.683 --> 02:16:47.976
MATT: "20 gold pieces <i>per</i> fighter. Groups of
five to eight are allowed to enter. There are

02:16:47.976 --> 02:16:50.016
"three rounds to this tournament."

02:16:50.016 --> 02:16:51.734
LAURA: We'll have to leave one of our members--

02:16:51.734 --> 02:16:53.216
SAM: That's true.

02:16:53.216 --> 02:16:54.729
MARISHA: Poor Stan.

02:16:54.729 --> 02:17:00.517
MATT: "Each victory is 200 gold to be dispersed
amongst your group and the winners that remain at

02:17:00.517 --> 02:17:03.526
"the end split a 2,000 gold purse."

02:17:03.526 --> 02:17:07.358
TRAVIS: Yeah, I believe that entry fee is along
the lines of what I remember.

02:17:07.358 --> 02:17:09.241
MARISHA: Yeah, that seems standard.

02:17:09.241 --> 02:17:10.651
TRAVIS: 20 gold will be fine.

02:17:10.651 --> 02:17:14.456
LAURA: Are there rules or are we just allowed to
use whatever we come into the tournament with?

02:17:14.456 --> 02:17:20.270
MATT: "Whatever you bring in there is at your
disposal to utilize. With your group that would

02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:25.484
"make four who have signed up for the tournament
today. You will brought down to the

02:17:25.484 --> 02:17:31.961
"waiting/holding area and each group will be
brought into the Victory Pit to face off with the

02:17:31.961 --> 02:17:34.053
"chosen peril."

02:17:34.053 --> 02:17:35.801
MARISHA: Wait, how did you get four?

02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:37.066
SAM: Four <i>groups</i>.

02:17:37.066 --> 02:17:40.369
MATT: "Four <i>groups</i>. You are the fourth to have
signed up."

02:17:40.369 --> 02:17:44.966
LAURA: Only three schmeasly other groups?

02:17:44.966 --> 02:17:48.642
ASHLEY: What are we fighting? Are we fighting the
other groups, or are we fighting something--

02:17:48.642 --> 02:17:54.621
MATT: "Of course not! You're fighting a number of
creatures that have been acquired and kept for

02:17:54.621 --> 02:18:00.560
"this tournament. Beasts and things that have been
either found wandering over the ranges of Xhorhas

02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:06.813
"or have terrorized the local countryside and have
been brought to us by the Righteous Brand for this

02:18:06.813 --> 02:18:08.591
"sort of tournament."

02:18:08.591 --> 02:18:11.615
SAM: Are there frightening beasts? Big beasts?
Magical beasts?

02:18:11.615 --> 02:18:13.776
TRAVIS: We know there are. I mean, that's what
we're looking for, right?

02:18:13.776 --> 02:18:15.905
MATT: "There may very well be, young lass."

02:18:15.905 --> 02:18:17.590
SAM: Then why are we doing this?

02:18:17.590 --> 02:18:18.483
MATT: "Good question."

02:18:18.483 --> 02:18:22.602
TRAVIS: Our friends, the Stubborn Stock, said that
this was the thing to do for people of our mettle.

02:18:22.602 --> 02:18:25.821
SAM: We're going to fight dangerous monsters.

02:18:25.821 --> 02:18:29.678
TRAVIS: Could you tell us who the other two groups
are, besides ourselves and the Stubborn Stock?

02:18:29.678 --> 02:18:31.867
MATT: "Well, do you wish to join?"

02:18:31.867 --> 02:18:33.151
TRAVIS: Of course, yeah.

02:18:33.151 --> 02:18:36.129
MATT: "Then present your coin. What is your
name?"

02:18:36.129 --> 02:18:38.343
TRAVIS: Fjord. Here, 20 gold.

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:40.759
MARISHA: Beauregard.

02:18:40.759 --> 02:18:45.035
LIAM: Caleb. Beauregard, can you front me 16
gold?

02:18:45.035 --> 02:18:47.188
MARISHA: (sighs)

02:18:47.188 --> 02:18:49.177
LIAM: There's four more for you.

02:18:49.177 --> 02:18:54.729
MARISHA: His name is Caleb and Beauregard, I want
that clear and on the record. It's Caleb and

02:18:54.729 --> 02:18:55.835
Beauregard.

02:18:55.835 --> 02:18:58.206
LIAM: Yeah, and Beauregard is the family name.

02:18:58.206 --> 02:19:00.258
SAM: Kylre.

02:19:00.258 --> 02:19:06.831
LAURA: Fancypants. 20 gold. There you are.

02:19:06.831 --> 02:19:09.104
MATT: "Very well."

02:19:09.104 --> 02:19:10.880
TALIESIN: Mollymauk.

02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:14.017
ASHLEY: Yasha.

02:19:14.017 --> 02:19:23.546
MATT: "Thank you. We've managed to squeeze you in
at the last moment. The rules are as such. Each

02:19:23.546 --> 02:19:29.423
"team will face off with one of these encounters
we've developed for this tournament, continuing on

02:19:29.423 --> 02:19:36.633
"if victorious to face another, until the other
teams fall, you fall, or the third round is

02:19:36.633 --> 02:19:42.199
"completed. Should there be more than one victory
team at the end you will divide the purse amongst

02:19:42.199 --> 02:19:50.348
"you. However, these will increase in difficulty
the further you remain. You will not be allowed

02:19:50.348 --> 02:19:57.362
"but the time it takes for the other teams to
battle before you face once more. Previous years

02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:04.048
"have shown us no more than maybe 20 minutes.
Whatever you have in each round is what you go in

02:20:04.048 --> 02:20:11.106
"with. Use your time wisely. All of this will be
displayed in front of the Starosta, the appointees

02:20:11.106 --> 02:20:16.785
"of the Crown, and the elite of the Tri-Spires.
Money and glory is here before you."

02:20:16.785 --> 02:20:23.663
LAURA: What happens if somebody in one of the
other groups dies or something when fighting the

02:20:23.663 --> 02:20:25.067
creatures?

02:20:25.067 --> 02:20:30.649
MATT: "We have clerics on hand, and outside of
extenuating circumstances, we've only had one true

02:20:30.869 --> 02:20:36.468
"fatality in the past 20 years of running this
festival, so you should be all right."

02:20:36.468 --> 02:20:38.496
LAURA: Good to know.

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:40.578
TRAVIS: For the other groups.

02:20:40.578 --> 02:20:42.366
LAURA: For the other groups, yes.

02:20:42.366 --> 02:20:47.328
MATT: At this point, there's a bit of commotion at
the front entrance where you guys entered where

02:20:47.328 --> 02:20:58.794
you see a figure rush in, a young human man. He's
sweating, longer blond hair past his ears. He's

02:20:58.794 --> 02:21:06.676
wearing a very bright gold and red outfit and is
carrying a satchel over one shoulder as he rushes

02:21:06.676 --> 02:21:11.198
in and talks to somebody. He points over in the
direction and heads up to where your group is.

02:21:11.198 --> 02:21:19.740
Yadaka goes, "I'm terribly sorry. Page!" The page
looks up. "What business have you from the Crown?"

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:24.421
Looking over his attire, the page goes,
(breathing heavily) "I must speak with the

02:21:24.421 --> 02:21:31.524
"Starosta immediately under order from King
Bertrand Dwendal himself." Yadaka goes, "Right.

02:21:31.524 --> 02:21:39.218
"Come with me. I apologize. You'll have to give us
just a moment." He turns around. "Urgent matters.

02:21:39.218 --> 02:21:45.424
"Enjoy some feasting while you're here." Him and
the page walk maybe 20 feet from you to a corner

02:21:45.424 --> 02:21:50.928
where you can see there is a central couch there
where a few figures are sitting, and they rush up.

02:21:50.928 --> 02:21:52.384
LIAM: Kitty.

02:21:52.384 --> 02:21:53.670
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:56.253
MATT: All right, so you roll a stealth check for
your cat.

02:21:56.253 --> 02:22:01.537
(laughter)

02:22:01.537 --> 02:22:03.839
LAURA: Cat butt right in their face.

02:22:03.839 --> 02:22:05.752
MARISHA: Yeah, just sprays them!

02:22:05.752 --> 02:22:12.656
MATT: As your cat begins to approach, one of the
servants goes, "You can't be in here," and--

02:22:12.656 --> 02:22:21.575
(laughter) Not everyone's going to kick a cat into
dust! Picks up Frumpkin and begins to bring

02:22:21.575 --> 02:22:30.686
Frumpkin away while the page begins gathering a
breath and you now see a very well-dressed

02:22:30.686 --> 02:22:38.704
halfling with a curled mass of brown hair up top.
It's graying and white on the sides, who sits up

02:22:38.704 --> 02:22:43.328
to meet with another important figure. Frumpkin
has been pulled away.

02:22:43.328 --> 02:22:44.843
LIAM: Where did my cat go?

02:22:44.843 --> 02:22:46.695
MATT: Your cat is being held by a servant.

02:22:46.695 --> 02:22:49.913
LIAM: The last I see of Frumpkin is where?

02:22:49.913 --> 02:22:53.121
MATT: Being led back towards where you came, like
taking the cat outside.

02:22:53.121 --> 02:22:57.908
LIAM: Okay. I count to six and then I snap my
fingers and pull him off of this plane.

02:22:57.908 --> 02:23:01.063
MATT: Okay. Servant's probably confused. What're
you guys doing?

02:23:01.063 --> 02:23:07.593
LAURA: I guess I'm going to do some jumping jacks
to prepare for this.

02:23:07.593 --> 02:23:16.522
LIAM: I have a leather thong or a string wrapped a
couple of times-- I'm going to ignore Laura

02:23:16.522 --> 02:23:22.160
Bailey-- wrapped around my thigh and I will grip
it in my hand and say a few arcane words and cast

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:28.444
Mage Armor and out from the leather strap around
my leg, a light shimmer goes up over the entire

02:23:28.444 --> 02:23:30.365
body for a split second and is gone.

02:23:30.365 --> 02:23:31.800
MATT: All right.

02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:34.370
LAURA: I would much prefer if it was actually a
leather thong that you had to put on in order to

02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:36.023
get the Mage Armor.

02:23:36.023 --> 02:23:38.697
LIAM: You have not seen me with my clothes off
yet.

02:23:38.697 --> 02:23:43.696
MATT: There are the groups that are talking and
eating, there's the page currently engaging with

02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:46.529
the folks and the figure, there's a couple of
servants passing around trays of food. What are

02:23:46.529 --> 02:23:53.290
the rest of you doing? You have retrieved your
Frumpkin into your space.

02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:55.945
LAURA: How do we prepare for this, Fjord?

02:23:55.945 --> 02:23:58.758
TRAVIS: Well, I have no idea what we're going to
face.

02:23:58.758 --> 02:24:00.164
SAM: Fighting monsters!

02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:01.555
TRAVIS: We don't know that.

02:24:01.555 --> 02:24:04.065
SAM: That's what the guy said! We're fighting
monsters.

02:24:04.065 --> 02:24:09.389
MATT: There's another clap and you see two other
figures get pulled from the other side to join the

02:24:09.389 --> 02:24:10.766
conversation by the couch.

02:24:10.766 --> 02:24:12.981
SAM: Should we go find out what's going on over
there?

02:24:12.981 --> 02:24:14.275
LAURA: I don't think we can.

02:24:14.275 --> 02:24:18.393
SAM: I could sneaky-sneak over there and listen.

02:24:18.393 --> 02:24:20.098
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it.

02:24:20.098 --> 02:24:22.322
MARISHA: Can you give her some blessing-type of
situation?

02:24:22.322 --> 02:24:25.181
LAURA: Oh yes (jibberish).

02:24:25.181 --> 02:24:40.502
SAM: I will cast Silent Image and I'm going to go
up to the corner, make the image of a three-foot

02:24:40.502 --> 02:24:46.327
by three-foot box around me.

02:24:46.327 --> 02:24:50.746
MARISHA: You're going full Solid Snake here?

02:24:50.746 --> 02:24:53.271
SAM: I'm going to just (quick footsteps).

02:24:53.271 --> 02:24:56.187
LAURA: That's not noticeable at all.

02:24:56.187 --> 02:24:58.742
MATT: Okay, make your stealth check with
advantage.

02:24:58.742 --> 02:25:00.414
TRAVIS: Amazing.

02:25:00.414 --> 02:25:02.144
SAM: Stealth?

02:25:02.144 --> 02:25:04.111
MATT: You get advantage because of her blessing.

02:25:04.111 --> 02:25:07.532
SAM: Oh, wow. 19.

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:16.690
MATT: Okay. You saunter up at a relatively close
distance. Make a perception check if you're trying

02:25:16.690 --> 02:25:18.601
to listen in.

02:25:18.601 --> 02:25:21.311
SAM: Can I see through the box? Oh, it's a
listening perception.

02:25:21.311 --> 02:25:23.675
MATT: Well, the box is an illusion.

02:25:23.675 --> 02:25:24.732
SAM: Four.

02:25:24.732 --> 02:25:26.198
MATT: (laughter) Four.

02:25:26.198 --> 02:25:27.489
TRAVIS: Fuck.

02:25:27.489 --> 02:25:42.941
MATT: You catch bits and pieces. Okay, what you
hear is the page hurriedly saying, "--which skies

02:25:42.941 --> 02:25:50.523
"now darken Brokenveil, over 1000 dead, the
Ashguard Garrison is taken." You hear this

02:25:50.570 --> 02:25:57.237
conversation a bit hush to hush, and a little bit
of (shushing). Starosta peeks in a bit. You only

02:25:57.237 --> 02:26:05.388
catch the next bit which goes, "What's the king's
response?" Then you hear the page respond and say,

02:26:05.388 --> 02:26:15.201
"--formally declared war on Kryn Dynasty and the
wastes of Xhorhas." There's some more muttering.

02:26:15.201 --> 02:26:19.799
You miss that. You miss that.

02:26:19.799 --> 02:26:20.974
LAURA: Oh no!

02:26:20.974 --> 02:26:22.956
MATT: (laughter) You miss that.

02:26:22.956 --> 02:26:25.837
LIAM: Secret warp zone to level eight, miss that.

02:26:25.837 --> 02:26:31.518
MATT: Yadaka pipes in and goes, "Starosta, to
announce anything like that would set panic and

02:26:31.518 --> 02:26:37.594
"change nothing. We are far from the fight. For
now, let them have a day to rejoice. We'll

02:26:37.594 --> 02:26:46.587
"announce tomorrow." You miss the next thing, you
miss the next thing. The last thing you hear is

02:26:46.587 --> 02:26:52.887
the Starosta say, "I'll send word to General
Grinbreaker and begin preparing her legion to move

02:26:52.887 --> 02:26:59.522
"east. Tomorrow we'll notify the public, but page,
return word to Rexxentrum that Zadash prepares to

02:26:59.522 --> 02:27:03.393
"join the front. Now, go." The page turns and
leaves.

02:27:03.393 --> 02:27:12.671
SAM: (quick footsteps) Still in box form, I am
going to go back up to them.

02:27:12.671 --> 02:27:13.891
MATT: Okay.

02:27:13.891 --> 02:27:17.497
SAM: Hey guys, it's me. I'm in a box!

02:27:17.497 --> 02:27:18.931
LAURA: Well, take it off.

02:27:18.931 --> 02:27:28.334
SAM: No, it's not a real box. I'll stick my hand
through it. I heard <i>everything</i>!

02:27:28.334 --> 02:27:30.388
TRAVIS: What's going down?

02:27:30.388 --> 02:27:35.041
SAM: There's an attack on Ashguard something.

02:27:35.041 --> 02:27:36.991
LAURA: Oh! That's the garrison over by the--

02:27:36.991 --> 02:27:45.087
SAM: Okay, thank you! The King said we're going to
declare war on Xhorhas or something like that, I

02:27:45.087 --> 02:27:52.703
don't remember. Then there's 1000 dead! The skies
were black--

02:27:52.703 --> 02:27:54.104
LAURA: On our side or their side?

02:27:54.104 --> 02:27:59.197
SAM: I don't know! Maybe ours? At the Garrison
there was 1000 dead, so that's our side? Wait, no,

02:27:59.197 --> 02:28:01.055
we're not on sides! We don't like the Empire!

02:28:01.055 --> 02:28:02.355
LAURA: I mean, who cares, right?

02:28:02.355 --> 02:28:06.596
SAM: Anyway, but they wanted to declare war and
they're not going to until tomorrow.

02:28:06.596 --> 02:28:09.882
LAURA: Good thing we didn't join the army, huh?

02:28:09.882 --> 02:28:11.092
SAM: Yes!

02:28:11.092 --> 02:28:13.772
TALIESIN: What makes you think they're not going
to start conscripting people tomorrow?

02:28:13.772 --> 02:28:19.438
LAURA: Oh no! Maybe if you competed and they saw
you were awesome, they're going to <i>tell</i> you you

02:28:19.438 --> 02:28:20.918
have to join.

02:28:20.918 --> 02:28:21.931
SAM: We should throw the fight.

02:28:21.931 --> 02:28:25.875
TALIESIN: Maybe we should win the fight, then
maybe think about getting out of town?

02:28:25.875 --> 02:28:27.586
TRAVIS: I agree with Molly.

02:28:27.586 --> 02:28:29.796
MARISHA: Caleb, is there anything about this
letter?

02:28:29.796 --> 02:28:32.708
LIAM: Do I notice anything?

02:28:32.708 --> 02:28:34.949
MATT: Which letter?

02:28:34.949 --> 02:28:39.748
MARISHA: I don't know, I'm paranoid right now.
It's just the scroll from the--

02:28:39.748 --> 02:28:42.947
MATT: It's a pamphlet.

02:28:42.947 --> 02:28:45.426
MARISHA: I don't know, ignore what I just said.

02:28:45.426 --> 02:28:47.130
TALIESIN: Made it at Kinko's.

02:28:47.130 --> 02:28:49.702
TRAVIS: Are there crownsguard in the little
waiting area that we're in?

02:28:49.702 --> 02:28:52.696
MATT: There are at the entrance where you came in
and each side.

02:28:52.696 --> 02:28:55.432
TRAVIS: Can I make my way to one that's over by
the entrance?

02:28:55.432 --> 02:28:59.527
MATT: Okay. You back up towards where you guys
came in, and there's a crownsguard there, arms

02:28:59.527 --> 02:29:01.025
crossed, looking up.

02:29:01.025 --> 02:29:05.724
TRAVIS: Man, I cannot wait to see this year's
Victory Pit competition! I hear the beasts are

02:29:05.724 --> 02:29:07.886
heartier than they were last year.

02:29:07.886 --> 02:29:11.830
MATT: "I certainly hope so. It's going to be a lot
of fun to watch."

02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:13.381
TRAVIS: Which one is your favorite so far?

02:29:13.381 --> 02:29:14.705
MATT: "Oh, which one?"

02:29:14.705 --> 02:29:16.467
TRAVIS: The beast they selected this year.

02:29:16.467 --> 02:29:19.611
MATT: "Well, I haven't seen them. They keep those
under wraps. It's part of the surprise."

02:29:19.611 --> 02:29:20.632
TRAVIS: Really?

02:29:20.632 --> 02:29:21.688
MATT: "Yeah!"

02:29:21.688 --> 02:29:24.581
TRAVIS: Man, I heard you guys were more informed
than that.

02:29:24.581 --> 02:29:27.758
MATT: (laughter) "Not us, that's above our pay
grade."

02:29:27.758 --> 02:29:31.403
TRAVIS: Really? Sheesh. What do you got to do to
get duty like that?

02:29:31.403 --> 02:29:38.134
MATT: "Well, you probably have to go to the King's
Hall and sign up for the Crownsguard. Kiss ass for

02:29:38.134 --> 02:29:40.176
"a few years and maybe then."

02:29:40.176 --> 02:29:42.294
TRAVIS: Where do the handlers of those beasts stay
around here?

02:29:42.294 --> 02:29:46.404
MATT: "I don't know. That's, once again, outside
of my jurisdiction. They keep a lot of things

02:29:46.450 --> 02:29:47.805
"separate intentionally."

02:29:47.805 --> 02:29:50.723
TRAVIS: Fair enough. You feel like dropping a coin
on a team, remember The Mighty Nein.

02:29:50.723 --> 02:29:54.923
MATT: "Right. Appreciate that, friend."

02:29:54.923 --> 02:29:56.870
TRAVIS: I walk away.

02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:57.844
MATT: Okay.

02:29:57.844 --> 02:30:00.844
TALIESIN: That was good. That was very good.

02:30:00.844 --> 02:30:08.504
LIAM: It occurs to me that starting tomorrow, it
would be more important than ever that we stick

02:30:08.504 --> 02:30:09.461
together.

02:30:09.461 --> 02:30:13.750
LAURA: All of us, or just you and Nott?

02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:17.558
LIAM: All of us.

02:30:17.558 --> 02:30:22.580
MARISHA: Jester, high-five.

02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:31.542
MATT: At this point, the barker who met you
originally says, "Sorry to bother you, but they're

02:30:31.634 --> 02:30:35.757
"gathering the various teams down into the holding
area. I'll have to escort you. Please come with me."

02:30:35.757 --> 02:30:44.054
MARISHA: As we walk off, I hold Caleb and walk
behind a little bit. What did you hear at the

02:30:44.054 --> 02:30:45.459
Cobalt Soul?

02:30:45.459 --> 02:30:46.727
LIAM: What?

02:30:46.727 --> 02:30:50.451
MARISHA: You were trying to get into the Cobalt
Soul, right?

02:30:50.451 --> 02:30:54.904
LIAM: Yeah, I talked to some people from there,
yeah.

02:30:54.904 --> 02:31:00.401
MARISHA: You replicated robes from the Cobalt
Soul, right? That's what you were going for.

02:31:00.401 --> 02:31:03.944
LIAM: Actually, it was not the exact same color.
It was a similar color, but not the same color.

02:31:03.944 --> 02:31:09.666
MARISHA: Yeah, that was a nice little error on
your part. You got real close. I can tell that you

02:31:09.666 --> 02:31:12.548
were trying to get the dyes. You know, the
gradients.

02:31:12.548 --> 02:31:15.888
LIAM: Beauregard, is there something that you are
after here?

02:31:15.888 --> 02:31:18.240
MARISHA: Did you hear anything?

02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:28.302
LIAM: Nothing pertaining to what we have just
learned. If that is what you are looking for, no.

02:31:28.302 --> 02:31:33.696
I want to enter that library, although tomorrow,
anything goes. I don't know.

02:31:33.696 --> 02:31:36.405
MARISHA: I'll get you into the library if you
want.

02:31:36.405 --> 02:31:39.659
LIAM: How will you get me into the library?

02:31:39.659 --> 02:31:48.574
MARISHA: I pull back my belt a little bit and show
him the rest of the script written out on the back

02:31:48.574 --> 02:31:51.277
of my belt from the Cobalt Reserve.

02:31:51.277 --> 02:31:54.849
LIAM: Would I instantly recognize that as the same
as the people I spoke to?

02:31:54.849 --> 02:31:56.751
MATT: As far as the--

02:31:56.751 --> 02:32:02.264
MARISHA: On my trainer's belt on the back.

02:32:02.264 --> 02:32:04.008
SAM: Do you have a tramp stamp back there?

02:32:04.008 --> 02:32:12.904
MARISHA: No, it's on my belt. Fancy embroidery on
the inside of my belt.

02:32:12.904 --> 02:32:21.870
MATT: Right. You look at it and there is similar
design to some of the outfits and the--

02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:26.419
LIAM: I mean, there's probably enough to go on
here. She's also dressed in blue. She's basically going--

02:32:26.419 --> 02:32:30.004
MATT: Yeah. You pick up on it.

02:32:30.004 --> 02:32:37.971
LIAM: Well, if we're not all dead in 48 hours,
maybe we can talk about that again.

02:32:37.971 --> 02:32:48.567
MARISHA: Yeah. Don't look at me like that! You can
look at me, just don't look at me like <i>that</i>!

02:32:48.567 --> 02:32:54.994
You're not going to look at me now, are you? Okay.
It's fine. You know what, we'll talk about it tomorrow.

02:32:54.994 --> 02:33:00.759
MATT: You guys are continuing to be escorted down
past. Most everyone has filtered into their seats.

02:33:00.759 --> 02:33:06.802
There's still stragglers finding their way in, and
as the day's sun is getting further into the

02:33:06.802 --> 02:33:14.914
mid-afternoon, you guys are brought down to an
area that is similar to that lounge area, but far

02:33:14.914 --> 02:33:24.296
less in its decor and comfort. This chamber has
two windowed doors on the opposite side that are

02:33:24.296 --> 02:33:30.299
cut through windows that lead into the central
arena. You can smell the dust on the opposite

02:33:30.299 --> 02:33:36.040
side. The interior is outfitted with about three
dozen simple stools that are scattered about, a

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:41.446
few tables with cornucopias of fruits and meats
that are set, and a few folks you see are feasting

02:33:41.446 --> 02:33:47.390
on them. There are two stationed healers of the
Platinum House of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon.

02:33:47.390 --> 02:33:59.099
They are the ones stationed there to prevent folks
from dying and the other combatants. In one

02:33:59.099 --> 02:34:09.035
corner, there are five soldiers of the Righteous
Brand, one of which is Gunther, who are in the

02:34:09.035 --> 02:34:12.512
process of taking large handfuls of food and
eating and getting themselves some energy for

02:34:12.512 --> 02:34:21.627
battle. As soon as you enter, they glance over and
give a bit of a nod of notification. Gunther,

02:34:21.627 --> 02:34:30.730
looking straight to you, grabs an apple of some
kind, and throws it at you. "Eat. You'll need it."

02:34:30.921 --> 02:34:33.119
ASHLEY: Thank you.

02:34:33.119 --> 02:34:35.953
LAURA: (whispers) He's got a crush on you, I can
tell.

02:34:35.953 --> 02:34:37.158
MARISHA: (whispers) Don't let him tell you what to
do!

02:34:37.158 --> 02:34:39.117
SAM: I'm in a box!

02:34:39.117 --> 02:34:41.273
(laughter)

02:34:41.273 --> 02:34:47.113
LAURA: We have a little box traveling with us.

02:34:47.113 --> 02:34:52.581
LIAM: I drop a little bit of spell components
through the box.

02:34:52.581 --> 02:34:59.323
MATT: It looks like amongst them there is one
acting as leader, or at least is in the process of

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:05.011
discussing tactics among the small troupe, though
you can't hear exactly what he is saying. An elven

02:35:05.011 --> 02:35:11.067
man with short brown hair, and these sky blue
piercing eyes who is in the process of giving

02:35:11.067 --> 02:35:14.826
orders to them. Then he walks off to the side,
pulls a blade out and begins practicing. It's this

02:35:14.826 --> 02:35:22.812
very elegant, almost dance-like blade technique.
On the opposite side of the room to them, all

02:35:22.812 --> 02:35:31.123
leaning against the wall, you see five dwarves and
two gnomes that are all wearing black and gold

02:35:31.123 --> 02:35:37.596
variations to armor, robes. They are avoiding all
social engagements and staring, mad dogging

02:35:37.596 --> 02:35:41.155
everyone else in the chamber. As soon as you
enter, all their eyes shift in your direction, and

02:35:41.155 --> 02:35:48.795
they watch you as you step into the chamber. In
the center of them, you see a gray haired dwarven

02:35:48.795 --> 02:35:56.620
women, weathered skin and a surly grin as you
approach, gleaming these yellow teeth from

02:35:56.620 --> 02:36:05.193
beneath, who gives a bit of a squinted stare at
you as you pass by. You see two battleaxes resting

02:36:05.193 --> 02:36:08.406
at the side of her belt, hanging off of her
armor.

02:36:08.406 --> 02:36:10.129
MARISHA: Is she her own team?

02:36:10.129 --> 02:36:21.584
MATT: Then over by the doors, snacking and looking
out the window into the pit before you, you see a

02:36:21.584 --> 02:36:31.271
group of six individuals in scuffed armor of green
and brown with weathered armor and skin that shows

02:36:31.271 --> 02:36:37.486
experience and travel. Markings and accessories
gives you a sense of inland Menagerie Coast

02:36:37.486 --> 02:36:42.896
heritage, and there you see Darrow who you had met
earlier in the tournament, who's leaning out the

02:36:42.896 --> 02:36:49.609
window. He turns around as you enter and goes,
"Ah, so you did indeed decide to join. Not too bad,

02:36:49.804 --> 02:36:51.837
"I'm excited to see how well you do."

02:36:51.837 --> 02:36:54.168
ASHLEY: Have you been in this tournament before?

02:36:54.168 --> 02:36:58.620
MATT: "I have not, but I've been hearing about it.
I'm excited to give it my all, as you say."

02:36:58.620 --> 02:37:01.991
TRAVIS: What are you going to do about the flying
creatures?

02:37:01.991 --> 02:37:09.489
MATT: "That's a good question. I imagine that's
less of my worry, and more of theirs." He points

02:37:09.489 --> 02:37:14.182
out to the rest of the people in the stands, and
goes, "I certainly hope they have ways to deal

02:37:14.182 --> 02:37:18.565
"with that, otherwise that's going to be a very
unhappy day tomorrow for the people in the city."

02:37:18.565 --> 02:37:19.838
TRAVIS: Indeed.

02:37:19.838 --> 02:37:22.055
LAURA: There will be a very unhappy day tomorrow.

02:37:22.055 --> 02:37:24.264
TALIESIN: Ixnay.

02:37:24.264 --> 02:37:25.106
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:37:25.106 --> 02:37:34.645
MATT: "That is not cryptic at all. Well, the
Stubborn Stock are my esteemed mercenary band.

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:36.617
"Friends, this is the--"

02:37:36.617 --> 02:37:39.116
TRAVIA: The Mighty Nein.

02:37:39.116 --> 02:37:45.739
MATT: "The Mighty Nein, we met earlier at the
places with the games." All of them give a nod and

02:37:45.739 --> 02:37:50.364
then grunt and reach over and start shaking hands.
They seem, of all the people in here, the most

02:37:50.364 --> 02:38:00.604
friendly. As soon as this happens, the crowd
outside starts cheering loudly. The sounds of chaos

02:38:00.604 --> 02:38:02.040
begin to build.

02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:08.412
MARISHA: Mortal Kombat!

02:38:08.412 --> 02:38:20.152
MATT: The cheers swell, and swell. You hear feet
slamming throughout the entire event, causing dust

02:38:20.152 --> 02:38:27.461
to come down off the ceiling above you. You begin
to realize that you are below some of the stands.

02:38:27.461 --> 02:38:33.792
A figure across the way emerges from another
doorway from the right and the crowd goes crazy.

02:38:33.792 --> 02:38:38.967
This humanoid figure steps to the center. Now
looking through the windows, you can see this is

02:38:38.967 --> 02:38:46.632
an open circular sand pit, where there are some
wall-like structures in places and pillars beyond

02:38:46.632 --> 02:38:55.541
those to break up the interior. It has some small
areas for cover and these pillars in the far

02:38:55.541 --> 02:39:04.940
corners of each side. This figure who walks in is
a tall half-giant figure covered in tattoos and

02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:10.400
spiked armor. As he approaches, his hands in the
air as the crowd's yelling and screaming.

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:12.114
LAURA: I hope we don't have to fight him.

02:39:12.114 --> 02:39:13.515
MARISHA: I want to be him.

02:39:13.515 --> 02:39:26.573
MATT: Steps out. "Welcome, all fair peoples of the
great empire under our King Bertrand Dwendal, may

02:39:26.573 --> 02:39:38.224
"his grace bless this harvest's end and grant us a
warm winter." The crowd goes crazy. "I am your

02:39:38.224 --> 02:39:49.155
"humble Jermai Kull, previous champion. While I
have left the fight, I now live for the fights of

02:39:49.155 --> 02:39:59.253
"others. It is my pleasure to bring you this year's
great tournament." The crowd swells again. Some of

02:39:59.253 --> 02:40:05.020
the groups behind start mounting up behind you and
everyone's crowding around the windows. "We

02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:12.427
"welcome our guests of high esteem on this day.
Give your applause to our keeper of freedom and

02:40:12.427 --> 02:40:19.600
"order, Lawmaster Orentha Stonegrasp." He points
across the way up in the stands. The cheers go

02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:23.291
bright and you see a figure stand up, and you can
see the gray haired dwarf who you had met in the

02:40:23.291 --> 02:40:30.454
King's Hall earlier. She's the Lawmaster of Zadash
who had come out to thank you for the job you had

02:40:30.454 --> 02:40:37.393
done in slaying the phase spider in the sewers.
She raises a hand and then sits down. Make a

02:40:37.567 --> 02:40:40.947
perception check as she waves her hand and gray
hair--

02:40:40.947 --> 02:40:42.343
TRAVIS: Natural one.

02:40:42.343 --> 02:40:42.960
MATT: Nope.

02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:44.517
TALIESIN: 17.

02:40:44.517 --> 02:40:45.326
SAM: 18.

02:40:45.326 --> 02:40:46.740
LAURA: Nine.

02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:48.967
MARISHA: 20.

02:40:48.967 --> 02:40:51.390
ASHLEY: Six.

02:40:51.390 --> 02:41:00.248
MATT: You glancing there, your eagle sight of an
inquisitive monk of the Cobalt Soul, glance past

02:41:00.248 --> 02:41:06.013
and you can see where she's sitting, and there,
about two people over sitting in the stand next to

02:41:06.013 --> 02:41:10.713
her is a familiar face. Pretty sure that's Dolan.

02:41:10.713 --> 02:41:13.693
SAM and MARISHA: Our Dolan.

02:41:13.693 --> 02:41:19.611
LAURA: Oh. He was supposed to go. Right?

02:41:19.611 --> 02:41:20.746
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:41:20.746 --> 02:41:22.753
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay.

02:41:22.753 --> 02:41:25.995
LIAM: Caleb is popping his hood up over his head
and face.

02:41:25.995 --> 02:41:36.497
MATT: "We also bring to this tournament the
Headmaster of the Zauber Spire, who repelled the

02:41:36.812 --> 02:41:44.096
"Crick assault on our great place of arcane
learning. Shaping the minds of our future mages,

02:41:44.096 --> 02:41:53.933
"Oremid Hass!" As the crowd cheers again, you see,
back a row and to the left, a figure stand and

02:41:53.933 --> 02:41:57.904
raise a hand. Once again, everybody roll a
perception check, please.

02:41:57.950 --> 02:41:59.200
SAM: Wow.

02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:04.155
MARISHA: Ugh, that was so bad. Not good. Five.

02:42:04.155 --> 02:42:05.431
LIAM: Ten.

02:42:05.431 --> 02:42:06.657
LAURA: 16.

02:42:06.962 --> 02:42:07.876
TALIESIN: Six.

02:42:07.876 --> 02:42:08.861
SAM: Nine.

02:42:08.861 --> 02:42:09.930
ASHLEY: Six.

02:42:09.930 --> 02:42:11.783
TRAVIS: Nine.

02:42:11.783 --> 02:42:13.480
MATT: Nine. 16 was the highest?

02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:13.980
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:15.380
MATT: Who was that?

02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:16.174
LAURA: Me.

02:42:16.174 --> 02:42:22.065
MATT: That was Jester. Jester, you glance up and
see, best you can a figure, a stocky, dark brown

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:27.469
skinned man with very short curled black hair
across the top of the head, very square jaw, in

02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:35.086
long red and gray robes. He raises a hand and
smiles and everyone cheers. Sitting next to him

02:42:35.086 --> 02:42:42.387
you see a figure that you had seen before. You can
make out an older human man with longer gray hair,

02:42:42.387 --> 02:42:47.780
bald on top. This was the mage you saw floating in
the sky during the attack.

02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:49.642
LAURA: Is he in white? Is that the color of robes
he--

02:42:49.642 --> 02:42:51.542
MATT: Yes, white and gold.

02:42:51.542 --> 02:42:52.790
LAURA: Whoa.

02:42:52.790 --> 02:43:03.047
MATT: "None of this would be possible if not for
the love of you, and celebration from our esteemed

02:43:03.047 --> 02:43:11.408
"Starosta Wyatt Fedar!" There at the very front of
that same area, you see the same halfling who was

02:43:11.408 --> 02:43:16.282
talking earlier to the page, step up on a small
platform to give him a little more height and

02:43:16.282 --> 02:43:23.416
prestige amongst this point. The male halfling
with the curly hair and the graying sides raises

02:43:23.416 --> 02:43:28.346
his hands and give a soft bow, and the crowd
explodes and cheers.

02:43:28.346 --> 02:43:30.156
MARISHA: You said this is the Starosta, right?

02:43:30.156 --> 02:43:42.154
MATT: This is him. "Now, we begin to bring in our
fighters for this, and our first competing team of

02:43:42.154 --> 02:43:52.032
"this Victory Pit tournament: The Last Line, all
the way from Bladegarden!" The doors open, and all

02:43:52.032 --> 02:43:59.623
the gentlemen and ladies in the Righteous Brand
armor push past you, with Gunther and the elven

02:43:59.623 --> 02:44:04.312
gentleman, step out into the light. Now you can
see the cloudy sky has broken up a bit, and there

02:44:04.312 --> 02:44:11.340
is a bit of sunlight coming down into this pit.
They step out into the center as the emcee begins

02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:18.471
to step away. He goes, "May the first fight be a
memorable one." He steps back and enters a distant

02:44:18.471 --> 02:44:28.826
door that closes behind him. They all spread out
and prepare. Across the way, a door opens and you

02:44:28.826 --> 02:44:33.988
see something shift out in chains that are then
pulled off the body and the doors close behind.

02:44:33.988 --> 02:44:43.852
There you see a 12-foot tall frog-humanoid-like
creature with a giant belly that begins to lumber

02:44:43.852 --> 02:44:50.928
forward towards them. They all immediately assault
this entity, jumping in the air, vaulting off

02:44:50.928 --> 02:44:55.723
sides of the walls, assaulting it. One gets
smacked in the face, it grabs another and throws

02:44:55.723 --> 02:45:00.165
it onto the ground. Another one rushes up as it
grabs and slams it onto the floor and puts its weight

02:45:00.165 --> 02:45:04.240
on top of it, one foot pushing it down. Gunther
rushes up with a blade and carves into a large

02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:08.788
section of its face. The crowd goes crazy as it
pulls back and shoves Gunther off with a back

02:45:08.788 --> 02:45:15.550
fist. The elven leader rushes forward and does a
few quick swipes with his blade. The large toad

02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:21.738
creature grabs it and attempts to swallow him, and
manages to do so, completely ingests the leader.

02:45:21.738 --> 02:45:28.230
The rest begin to assault. Make an arcana check.

02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:32.677
LIAM: 18.

02:45:32.677 --> 02:45:38.054
MATT: 18. You don't recognize the creature, but
there's something about this entity.

02:45:38.054 --> 02:45:42.027
SAM: There's just something about him.

02:45:42.027 --> 02:45:43.248
TRAVIS: No, nine.

02:45:43.248 --> 02:45:49.893
MATT: No. All right, this fight goes on for
another minute or so. You watch them trade blows

02:45:49.893 --> 02:45:53.578
back and forth. Nobody falls, and eventually the
general carves his way from the stomach of the

02:45:53.578 --> 02:45:57.554
beast with a giant swipe of his blade. You watch
as the blood begins to pour from it as he leaps

02:45:57.554 --> 02:46:04.292
out, coated in saliva and the creature's own
crimson, spins around, and as the large toad beast

02:46:04.292 --> 02:46:11.059
pulls back, they all together, with one unified
strike, surround and attack it. The beast lumbers

02:46:11.462 --> 02:46:17.736
forward and falls to the ground, unconscious. With
a rousing cheer from the audience, the previous

02:46:17.903 --> 02:46:22.741
doors open. As the soldiers raise their weapons
high and give a respectful bow, they begin to walk

02:46:22.741 --> 02:46:29.016
back towards the holding area, as they drag the
unconscious body of this creature back to where it came.

02:46:29.178 --> 02:46:31.252
LAURA: Do we all fight the same type of creature?

02:46:31.252 --> 02:46:33.417
TALIESIN: Probably not.

02:46:33.417 --> 02:46:38.395
MATT: The emcee shouts again from the side, "With
that, the banderhobb has fallen!"

02:46:38.395 --> 02:46:40.651
SAM: Bander rob?

02:46:40.651 --> 02:46:49.860
MATT: "Next, a last minute addition to today's
tournament. We bring forth, traveled from

02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:51.204
"everywhere--"

02:46:51.204 --> 02:46:52.308
LAURA: That's us!

02:46:52.308 --> 02:46:53.901
MATT: "The Mighty Nein!"

02:46:53.901 --> 02:46:55.201
SAM: Oh, shit, it's us!

02:46:55.201 --> 02:47:00.092
MATT: The doors open again, and you guys are given
a straight path into the center of this field.

02:47:00.092 --> 02:47:03.359
TRAVIS: Yeah, bring it out!

02:47:03.359 --> 02:47:05.407
LAURA: Oh my god!

02:47:05.407 --> 02:47:07.308
SAM: This was such a good day.

02:47:07.308 --> 02:47:09.377
LAURA: Oh no!

02:47:09.377 --> 02:47:11.441
MATT: It's okay. I bumped it on the way over.

02:47:11.441 --> 02:47:17.006
SAM: Whoa. Did you print that? On a laser
printer?

02:47:17.006 --> 02:47:19.421
MATT: No, this was from Mats by Mars, they do
awesome stuff.

02:47:19.421 --> 02:47:20.721
LAURA: Oh my god, that's so cool.

02:47:20.721 --> 02:47:24.826
MATT: You guys can place yourselves where you'd
like.

02:47:24.826 --> 02:47:28.488
SAM: Where's the doors to the-- oh, they're over
there. Got it.

02:47:28.488 --> 02:47:35.888
MATT: Any particular placement you'd like, as you
guys have a moment to set yourselves up here.

02:47:35.888 --> 02:47:39.535
LIAM: Would I have been able to cast a spell as we
are pushed forward into all this mess?

02:47:39.535 --> 02:47:40.740
MATT: You would.

02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:41.649
LIAM: Blur.

02:47:41.649 --> 02:47:44.271
MATT: Blur, all right. You have a Blur spell on
right now.

02:47:44.271 --> 02:47:48.094
TRAVIS: Put me behind that wall, yep.

02:47:48.094 --> 02:47:49.600
MARISHA: Where's the opening?

02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:51.386
LAURA: Yeah, where did the monster come out of?

02:47:51.386 --> 02:47:55.780
MATT: You guys entered from this side over here,
and you saw the monster enter from this space.

02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:57.082
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:47:57.082 --> 02:48:02.022
LIAM: Matt, I take that back. I'm not going to
cast Blur. Sorry, my apologies.

02:48:02.022 --> 02:48:03.564
MATT: All righty.

02:48:03.564 --> 02:48:04.566
LAURA: Can you help me?

02:48:04.566 --> 02:48:05.558
MATT: What do you want to do?

02:48:05.558 --> 02:48:06.883
LAURA: I want to be there.

02:48:06.883 --> 02:48:09.815
ASHLEY: Can I do that on the other one, opposite
her?

02:48:09.815 --> 02:48:11.580
MATT: Sure.

02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:13.025
TALIESIN: I'll back up into mine.

02:48:13.025 --> 02:48:15.434
LIAM: As close to the center as is possible.

02:48:15.434 --> 02:48:19.025
SAM: I will be behind the pillar over there.

02:48:19.025 --> 02:48:20.121
MATT: Over here?

02:48:20.121 --> 02:48:23.249
SAM: No, this one over-- yes, thank you.

02:48:23.249 --> 02:48:26.430
TALIESIN: That, I think, is the door where it
opens.

02:48:26.430 --> 02:48:30.411
MARISHA: It could be anywhere, to be fair.

02:48:30.411 --> 02:48:32.293
LAURA: Oh, right. There's multiple doors.

02:48:32.293 --> 02:48:39.394
MATT: The emcee disappears and vanishes into the
back. You guys all take a quiet moment, looking

02:48:39.394 --> 02:48:45.472
around you in silence. As the audience gets quiet,
still, you can see hundreds and hundreds of faces

02:48:45.472 --> 02:48:51.925
all staring, strangely formless when it's a cloud
like this in all directions, little beams of light

02:48:51.925 --> 02:48:56.670
peeking through the clouds, hitting the sand and
dirt on the ground before you. In that quiet, you

02:48:56.670 --> 02:49:04.386
hear (slamming). You glance around briefly and see
not one, but two doors seem to have opened.

02:49:04.386 --> 02:49:05.831
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

02:49:05.831 --> 02:49:09.481
MATT: Only one of them has a creature that
emerges. It seems like they're playing mind games

02:49:09.481 --> 02:49:11.086
with you so you don't know where it's coming--

02:49:11.165 --> 02:49:13.079
TRAVIS: Or the other one's invisible.

02:49:13.079 --> 02:49:20.738
MATT: The door to this side suddenly swings open,
and a beast begins to lumber out, chains detaching

02:49:20.738 --> 02:49:30.640
from manacles on two of its tethered, large
tentacle-like arms. This grayish-brown mass,

02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:37.004
probably close to 15 feet in height, with a giant
mouth filled with teeth and a large tongue that

02:49:37.004 --> 02:49:43.085
lolls off the side. Three tendrils reach off of it
as these large, heavy feet pull it forward. Smell

02:49:43.085 --> 02:49:51.406
wafts around it of feces and rot. I need all of
you to roll initiative, as this creature emerges

02:49:51.406 --> 02:49:52.675
right there.

02:49:52.675 --> 02:49:55.700
LAURA: It's a big eating-poop pile!

02:49:55.700 --> 02:50:01.697
LIAM: Liam knows what that is. Grody to the max!

02:50:01.697 --> 02:50:04.361
LAURA: Yeah, gag me with a spoon, Mrs. Henderson!

02:50:04.361 --> 02:50:07.085
ASHLEY: Gag me with a spoon!

02:50:07.085 --> 02:50:10.262
MATT: 25 to 20.

02:50:10.262 --> 02:50:16.925
MARISHA: Hang on! Oh, that moved it! It was a 19
plus one. 24!

02:50:16.925 --> 02:50:17.897
SAM: Whoa!

02:50:17.897 --> 02:50:19.043
MATT: 24, all right.

02:50:19.043 --> 02:50:20.310
TALIESIN: 23.

02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:26.884
MATT: Beau, Molly! Anybody else? Okay, 20 to 15.

02:50:26.884 --> 02:50:28.149
LIAM: 18.

02:50:28.149 --> 02:50:29.366
MATT: 18 for Caleb.

02:50:29.366 --> 02:50:30.683
SAM: Oh, 16 here.

02:50:30.683 --> 02:50:37.402
MATT: All right, Nott. 15 to ten? Ten to five?

02:50:37.402 --> 02:50:39.937
LAURA, TRAVIS, and ASHLEY: Six!

02:50:39.937 --> 02:50:43.852
MATT: Oh, dear.

02:50:43.852 --> 02:50:46.146
MARISHA: Oh no! It's a sign.

02:50:46.146 --> 02:50:49.000
SAM: (demonic voice) Present!

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.795
MATT: All righty, I believe that's everyone?

02:50:51.795 --> 02:50:53.172
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:50:53.172 --> 02:50:59.160
MATT: Top of the round, as this being (stomping)
(sucking), its tongue slabbering around its open

02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:01.343
maw, Beau, you're up.

02:51:01.343 --> 02:51:08.038
MARISHA: (inhales) Okay! I can clear the distance,
right? 40 feet?

02:51:08.038 --> 02:51:10.909
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25. Yeah, easily.

02:51:10.909 --> 02:51:13.053
SAM: Oh yeah, go closer to the creature. That's a
good idea.

02:51:13.053 --> 02:51:14.389
LAURA: That's what she does!

02:51:14.389 --> 02:51:16.733
MARISHA: I fight with my fists, Sam!

02:51:16.733 --> 02:51:17.941
SAM: I don't like it! It's scary!

02:51:17.941 --> 02:51:19.217
ASHLEY: Fists of fury!

02:51:19.217 --> 02:51:23.467
LAURA: Fists of fury, Mrs. Henderson!

02:51:23.467 --> 02:51:25.550
ASHLEY: Fists of furry, Mrs. Henderson!

02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:31.314
MARISHA: Before I run off, I go: Does anyone know
if this is a time trial, or something? Then I run

02:51:31.314 --> 02:51:33.482
off towards it.

02:51:33.482 --> 02:51:36.841
MATT: Okay, are you driving straight towards it?
Or are you coming from a specific angle?

02:51:36.841 --> 02:51:39.079
MARISHA: No, I mean, straight towards it.

02:51:39.079 --> 02:51:40.668
MATT: All right, there you go.

02:51:40.668 --> 02:51:49.268
MARISHA: Then, instead of my staff, I'm drawing my
two wooden swords that I won with Nott.

02:51:49.268 --> 02:51:51.126
SAM: Oh, no.

02:51:51.126 --> 02:51:56.786
MARISHA: I'm going to beat face with my wooden
swords, with my two attacks.

02:51:56.786 --> 02:51:59.869
MATT: Okay, so are you--

02:51:59.869 --> 02:52:02.665
MARISHA: This is going to be great!

02:52:02.665 --> 02:52:06.392
MATT: Here's my question: is this just flavor to
your unarmed strikes, or are you actually trying

02:52:06.392 --> 02:52:07.786
to damage it with the wooden swords?

02:52:07.786 --> 02:52:14.689
MARISHA: I was thinking more like flavor to my
unarmed strikes, but I'm a monk, so?

02:52:14.689 --> 02:52:17.406
MATT: All right, so it looks like you're fighting
with the swords, but you're really punching with them.

02:52:17.406 --> 02:52:18.538
MARISHA: I'm punching.

02:52:18.538 --> 02:52:19.546
MATT: It's more for the show of it.

02:52:19.546 --> 02:52:20.716
MARISHA: Yeah. It's funsies.

02:52:20.716 --> 02:52:23.328
LIAM: What if they are like police batons?

02:52:23.328 --> 02:52:25.768
MATT: They're not that strong.

02:52:25.768 --> 02:52:27.362
LAURA: They're like balsa wood.

02:52:27.362 --> 02:52:31.750
MATT: Go ahead. Two attacks.

02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:42.529
MARISHA: First one's a 14, second one's a seven
plus six, so sorry, 20 for the first one and 13

02:52:42.529 --> 02:52:43.518
for the second.

02:52:43.518 --> 02:52:44.862
MATT: First one hits, second one misses.

02:52:44.862 --> 02:52:50.670
MARISHA: Okay, ooh! That is 12 damage.

02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:56.250
MATT: 12 points of damage as you hit it and you
feel the actual wood of the sword crack a little

02:52:56.250 --> 02:53:02.711
bit, but your fist does hit the beast in the side,
its giant blubbery, nasty body, almost slippery

02:53:02.711 --> 02:53:08.388
and sticky on impact, shifts from the blow. Is
that your turn?

02:53:08.388 --> 02:53:10.638
MARISHA: Then I'm going to spend a ki point and do
one more.

02:53:10.638 --> 02:53:11.797
MATT: Go for it.

02:53:11.797 --> 02:53:16.319
MARISHA: Flurry of blows. That's not good at all.
Ten.

02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:22.421
MATT: Total ten? That misses. The third blow goes
wide, no impact. That ends your turn. Molly,

02:53:22.421 --> 02:53:23.574
you're up.

02:53:23.574 --> 02:53:31.356
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Vicious Mockery and
just, you know: (demonic voice) You've got no

02:53:31.356 --> 02:53:34.938
arms, it's awful! It's a psychic attack.

02:53:34.938 --> 02:53:36.416
LAURA: I start laughing.

02:53:36.416 --> 02:53:39.532
MATT: That's a--

02:53:39.532 --> 02:53:41.855
TALIESIN: It says wisdom, but is it charisma?

02:53:41.855 --> 02:53:44.216
MATT: It's a wisdom save, but it's charisma-based.
The DC's ten.

02:53:44.216 --> 02:53:45.554
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

02:53:45.554 --> 02:53:47.195
MATT: That's a natural 20 on its saving throw.

02:53:47.195 --> 02:53:48.341
TALIESIN: That saves.

02:53:48.341 --> 02:53:49.227
MATT: Sorry.

02:53:49.227 --> 02:53:53.382
TALIESIN: That's okay. I'm going to also use my
bonus action to light my other sword.

02:53:53.382 --> 02:53:55.341
MATT: All right, so you have both blades now
going?

02:53:55.341 --> 02:53:58.220
TALIESIN: I have both blades going now, so I'm
knocking that down.

02:53:58.220 --> 02:53:59.409
MATT: Which rite?

02:53:59.409 --> 02:54:03.549
TALIESIN: With not the ice, the--

02:54:03.549 --> 02:54:07.376
MATT: The Rite of the Dawn? Okay, got it. Both of
your blades are now glowing.

02:54:07.376 --> 02:54:18.081
TALIESIN: I'm going to run, let's see, I've got 30
feet? I'm going to cross and run for cover behind that.

02:54:18.264 --> 02:54:19.079
MATT: There?

02:54:19.079 --> 02:54:19.566
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:54:19.566 --> 02:54:23.184
MATT: That ends your turn, Molly. It is now the
creature's turn.

02:54:23.184 --> 02:54:30.124
LAURA: Oh, let's see what it weirdly does. It's
going to poop on you!

02:54:30.124 --> 02:54:33.102
SAM: Or breathe some awful breath of death.

02:54:33.102 --> 02:54:34.734
TALIESIN: It's going to swallow people.

02:54:34.734 --> 02:54:42.259
MATT: It's going to step up right there. As it
passes by, it's going to go ahead and swing one of

02:54:42.259 --> 02:54:47.559
its large tentacle arms, which you see have these
long, curved tooth-like protrusions at the end,

02:54:47.559 --> 02:54:56.506
almost like a slapping squid tentacle. It swings
toward you, Beau, with the first one. Natural one.

02:54:56.506 --> 02:55:03.863
Nope, that misses. You manage to duck it. However,
it swings-- okay, that is a 17 to hit, what's your

02:55:03.863 --> 02:55:05.102
armor class?

02:55:05.102 --> 02:55:05.597
MARISHA: 17.

02:55:05.597 --> 02:55:09.512
MATT: Just hits. As the tentacle misses to strike
you, it does manage to grab you from behind and

02:55:09.512 --> 02:55:13.091
pull you in toward its mouth. As it opens and
chomps down on you--

02:55:13.289 --> 02:55:15.807
MARISHA: Aw, gross!

02:55:15.807 --> 02:55:17.465
MATT: Yeah, you're pulled into its poopy mouth.

02:55:17.465 --> 02:55:21.018
LAURA: Ew! It's like Charlie!

02:55:21.018 --> 02:55:29.143
MATT: That is 15 points of piercing damage, and I
need you to roll a constitution saving throw, as

02:55:29.143 --> 02:55:30.580
the horribly--

02:55:30.580 --> 02:55:32.421
LAURA: How much damage did he do?

02:55:32.421 --> 02:55:33.990
MATT: 15 points of piercing damage.

02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:35.408
LAURA: 15 fucking points!

02:55:35.408 --> 02:55:36.751
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw, please.

02:55:36.751 --> 02:55:45.431
MARISHA: Don't. Fuck. Me Gil! Ooh, that was almost
a natural 20! This always happens with Gil. Six?

02:55:45.431 --> 02:55:56.337
MATT: Six, no. As the teeth sink into your body
and you pull away, you feel this mild infection

02:55:56.337 --> 02:55:58.990
already begin to set inside you, and you are
poisoned.

02:55:58.990 --> 02:56:00.980
LAURA: Oh no, you're poisoned!

02:56:00.980 --> 02:56:04.360
MARISHA: He gives you heartburn, you guys. It's
real bad.

02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:09.219
MATT: The other tentacle is going to swing over
towards you, Jester, as it sees you around the

02:56:09.219 --> 02:56:14.634
corner. That, however, is a really poor roll.
That's going to be an eight, that misses you. You

02:56:14.634 --> 02:56:18.682
duck and it hits the stone, causing this dust to
spray off of it from the impact. That's going to

02:56:18.682 --> 02:56:20.335
end its turn. Caleb, you're up.

02:56:20.335 --> 02:56:26.456
LIAM: I pull out a handful of iron powder, and I
throw it into the air so it's a big cloud, and my

02:56:26.456 --> 02:56:31.352
two hands go (sweeping noise), and Yasha grows to
twice her normal size.

02:56:31.352 --> 02:56:33.475
ALL: What?!

02:56:33.475 --> 02:56:34.812
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:56:34.812 --> 02:56:39.962
MATT: For the purposes of that, we'll put Yasha on
this big old dice there.

02:56:39.962 --> 02:56:42.324
ASHLEY: Does that mean I do twice the damage?

02:56:42.324 --> 02:56:43.602
MATT: Not twice.

02:56:43.602 --> 02:56:44.904
SAM: Yes, it does.

02:56:44.904 --> 02:56:49.356
LIAM: Then I will use my movement to get over to
the corner near Fjord. If I could get around it, I

02:56:49.356 --> 02:56:50.914
would, but I'm sure I don't have enough movement.

02:56:50.914 --> 02:56:54.199
MATT: Six is about as close as you can get,
there.

02:56:54.199 --> 02:56:57.754
LIAM: Yeah, so you're at advantage because of your
size and all of your attacks have an additional

02:56:57.754 --> 02:56:58.917
1d4.

02:56:58.917 --> 02:57:00.422
ASHLEY: (high-pitched) Ooh!

02:57:00.422 --> 02:57:03.039
SAM: She's huge!

02:57:03.039 --> 02:57:06.099
LIAM: She's 14 feet tall.

02:57:06.099 --> 02:57:07.735
SAM: 14?

02:57:07.735 --> 02:57:09.726
LIAM: No, you're six? 12 feet tall.

02:57:09.726 --> 02:57:12.473
ASHLEY: I'm like 5'11".

02:57:12.473 --> 02:57:17.951
LIAM: 12-ish feet tall. Doubles it. Your weight is
eight times its normal weight.

02:57:17.951 --> 02:57:26.061
MATT: You have advantage on strength checks and
saving throws, which is what your rage does, but

02:57:26.061 --> 02:57:29.113
your weapons do an additional 1d4 points of damage
when you hit, which is good.

02:57:29.113 --> 02:57:30.605
ASHLEY: Excellent. I'm into that.

02:57:30.605 --> 02:57:32.120
MARISHA: I've had this dream.

02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:33.486
MATT: Caleb, that ends your turn.

02:57:33.486 --> 02:57:41.631
MARISHA: Question, quick retroactive one: Can I
use my reaction attack when that thing attacked

02:57:41.631 --> 02:57:43.442
Jester to do my Sentinel thing?

02:57:43.442 --> 02:57:44.466
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:57:44.466 --> 02:57:45.559
MARISHA: Can I do that?

02:57:45.559 --> 02:57:49.454
MATT: Go for it. As it strikes and misses Jester,
you get one swing, but it's with disadvantage on

02:57:49.454 --> 02:57:51.556
the attack because you're poisoned.

02:57:51.556 --> 02:57:54.490
MARISHA: Nope.

02:57:54.490 --> 02:57:59.696
MATT: Swing wide, unfortunately you're hazy in
your view, and you feel the poison start to seep

02:57:59.696 --> 02:58:04.324
into your veins, the diseased bite of the creature
starting to infect your torso. That ends Caleb's

02:58:04.324 --> 02:58:05.493
turn, Nott, you're up.

02:58:05.493 --> 02:58:07.415
SAM: I will shoot my thing at it!

02:58:07.415 --> 02:58:10.025
MATT: You other three are up after that, at the
same time.

02:58:10.025 --> 02:58:11.430
SAM: 21 to hit.

02:58:11.430 --> 02:58:12.950
MATT: That hits! Roll damage.

02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:14.422
SAM: Is Yasha--

02:58:14.422 --> 02:58:16.581
MATT: Yeah, they're adjacent, so you get sneak
attack.

02:58:16.581 --> 02:58:17.920
LAURA: Whoa, that's good.

02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:19.027
MATT: Oh, damn!

02:58:19.027 --> 02:58:23.034
SAM: Okay, (counting) 19.

02:58:23.034 --> 02:58:24.587
MATT: 19 points of damage.

02:58:24.587 --> 02:58:35.434
SAM: Wait, you know what? If I'm going to be
honest, that thing is beyond 30 feet, so I would

02:58:35.434 --> 02:58:39.505
have moved in closer so I don't have to fire at
disadvantage.

02:58:39.505 --> 02:58:42.159
MATT: Okay, so I'll put you about there to do
that.

02:58:42.159 --> 02:58:44.091
SAM: Then do I have any movement left?

02:58:44.091 --> 02:58:46.146
MATT: Five feet.

02:58:46.146 --> 02:58:56.701
SAM: All right, well then I'll dash and I'll go
back around towards me, behind this corner and

02:58:56.701 --> 02:59:00.836
hide. Just duck back there. That's it! Take a
swig.

02:59:00.836 --> 02:59:07.136
MATT: Take a swig. It's a free action. All right,
Jester, Yasha, and Fjord, you guys are going at

02:59:07.136 --> 02:59:09.079
the same time, so you decide who is going to take
their action first.

02:59:09.079 --> 02:59:10.685
TRAVIS: Ladies first.

02:59:10.685 --> 02:59:11.714
ASHLEY: We can go in that order.

02:59:11.714 --> 02:59:14.541
MATT: All right, so Jester, Yasha, then Fjord.
Jester.

02:59:14.541 --> 02:59:26.530
LAURA: Okay, well he's right there, so I'm going
to use Sacred Flame on him. Oh, actually I'm

02:59:26.530 --> 02:59:30.452
really close and he's already been hurt. I'm going
to Toll the Dead on him.

02:59:30.452 --> 02:59:33.717
MATT: What saving throw is that?

02:59:33.717 --> 02:59:36.843
LAURA: That is a wisdom saving throw!

02:59:36.843 --> 02:59:39.442
MATT: Rolled a four. Three plus one.

02:59:39.442 --> 02:59:46.258
LAURA: I get to hit him! Seven points of damage!

02:59:46.258 --> 02:59:52.593
MATT: Seven points of necrotic damage. As the bell
(ringing) you watch as the creature shimmies in place.

02:59:52.593 --> 02:59:57.343
LAURA: I want to back away! Did he already use his
reaction at all?

02:59:57.343 --> 02:59:59.799
MATT: You don't think so. What do you want to do?

02:59:59.799 --> 03:00:01.227
LAURA: Oh no.

03:00:01.227 --> 03:00:02.937
SAM: Just run away. What could happen?

03:00:02.937 --> 03:00:04.081
MARISHA: Run away!

03:00:04.081 --> 03:00:07.325
LAURA: No, fuck it, I'm going to stay right
there.

03:00:07.325 --> 03:00:09.935
MATT: Jester stays. Yasha, what are you doing?

03:00:09.935 --> 03:00:11.791
ASHLEY: If I move--

03:00:11.791 --> 03:00:14.236
SAM: (deep voice) I'm sorry, you have to talk like
this now.

03:00:14.529 --> 03:00:22.511
ASHLEY: (deep voice) If I move (normal voice)
right here, am I ten feet of the creature, but

03:00:22.511 --> 03:00:26.543
they're not ten feet of me, right?

03:00:26.543 --> 03:00:31.343
MATT: You don't get reach with the Enlarge, so you
still have to get one more to hit with the melee

03:00:31.343 --> 03:00:32.513
weapon.

03:00:32.513 --> 03:00:37.274
ASHLEY: Okay, I get one more, but I'm not ten feet
away from Beau and Jester, right?

03:00:37.274 --> 03:00:39.494
MATT: You're ten feet away from Beau, currently.

03:00:39.494 --> 03:00:44.243
ASHLEY: Can I go one over to the right?

03:00:44.243 --> 03:00:48.751
MATT: There? You're ten feet away from Jester,
yeah.

03:00:48.751 --> 03:00:50.632
LIAM: Who do you choose?

03:00:50.632 --> 03:01:00.004
ASHLEY: You know what, I won't do that right now.
I would like to rage.

03:01:00.004 --> 03:01:03.100
MATT: Rage kicks in.

03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:09.462
ASHLEY: I'm going to use my Magician's Judge sword
and start swinging.

03:01:09.462 --> 03:01:13.637
MATT: You have any reckless attacks, or not?

03:01:13.637 --> 03:01:14.958
ASHLEY: Say again?

03:01:14.958 --> 03:01:16.508
MATT: No, that's fine.

03:01:16.508 --> 03:01:18.257
ASHLEY: Oh, no. 14.

03:01:18.257 --> 03:01:19.959
MATT: 14 just hits, go ahead and roll damage.

03:01:19.959 --> 03:01:21.441
LAURA: You get advantage, remember.

03:01:21.441 --> 03:01:25.778
MATT: Not on attacks. If she does reckless, she
gets advantage.

03:01:25.778 --> 03:01:27.208
LAURA: Okay, sorry.

03:01:27.208 --> 03:01:29.547
LIAM: And your 1d4 for being gigantic.

03:01:29.547 --> 03:01:47.570
ASHLEY: (counting) 20.

03:01:47.570 --> 03:01:51.938
MATT: 20 points of damage with the strike. As
large Yasha (heavy footsteps)--

03:01:51.938 --> 03:01:53.391
SAM: You added all your shit to that?

03:01:53.391 --> 03:01:54.944
ASHLEY: I added all my shit.

03:01:54.944 --> 03:02:00.007
MATT: This is going to be a thing. I have to make
a large Yasha figure now. Swing the giant blade

03:02:00.007 --> 03:02:05.578
with two hands. As the blade carves down, it
embeds itself four or five inches into the body of

03:02:05.578 --> 03:02:10.151
the creature. It pulls back instinctually, and as
it does, it drags the blade through its body and

03:02:10.151 --> 03:02:16.940
blood sprays out. The blood itself is a thick
brown color, and the smell gets even worse as it

03:02:16.940 --> 03:02:21.367
begins to spray its ichor around the air. Well
done. Is that your turn?

03:02:21.367 --> 03:02:23.250
ASHLEY: Yep, and I'm going to stay right there.

03:02:23.250 --> 03:02:24.544
MATT: Fjord, your turn.

03:02:24.544 --> 03:02:28.629
TRAVIS: Can I turn towards the beast, and I'll
cast Eldritch Blast at it.

03:02:28.629 --> 03:02:30.832
MATT: Go for it. You step out from behind cover.

03:02:30.832 --> 03:02:37.248
TRAVIS: That is a 23 to hit.

03:02:37.248 --> 03:02:39.216
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:02:39.216 --> 03:02:43.293
TRAVIS: That is a ten plus four, 14 points of
damage.

03:02:43.293 --> 03:02:44.541
MATT: Nice!

03:02:44.541 --> 03:02:46.840
TRAVIS: Can I roll back behind cover?

03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:49.605
MATT: You can. Dart back onto the edge--

03:02:49.605 --> 03:02:52.635
TRAVIS: Even a couple more. Out of view, there we
go.

03:02:52.635 --> 03:02:56.810
MATT: That ends your turn. Top of the round, Beau,
you're up.

03:02:56.810 --> 03:03:04.207
MARISHA: I'm going to fight, both my swords, pop
pop, coming down on his head. Don't fuck me, Gil.

03:03:04.207 --> 03:03:06.295
That's all right, 18.

03:03:06.295 --> 03:03:07.571
MATT: Disadvantage on all attacks.

03:03:07.571 --> 03:03:11.766
MARISHA: Disadvantage because I'm poisoned. 18.

03:03:11.766 --> 03:03:13.124
MATT: 18 hits!

03:03:13.124 --> 03:03:16.358
LIAM: Matt, is that ring for what, concentration?

03:03:16.358 --> 03:03:17.382
MATT: Concentration.

03:03:17.382 --> 03:03:21.296
MARISHA: That's not a thing. Nine damage.

03:03:21.296 --> 03:03:26.853
MATT: Nine points of damage as you strike it. This
time, the wooden sword does snap. It breaks on

03:03:26.853 --> 03:03:28.810
impact. You still have the hilt.

03:03:28.810 --> 03:03:32.144
MARISHA: I turn to the audience and I go:
(yelling)

03:03:32.144 --> 03:03:35.289
MATT: (distant yelling) There's a resounding
cheer.

03:03:35.289 --> 03:03:41.565
MARISHA: I go: Yasha, look! I do Patient Defense
for my other ki point.

03:03:41.565 --> 03:03:47.957
MATT: You go in your defensive stance. Good. That
ends your turn. Molly, you're up.

03:03:47.957 --> 03:03:51.130
TALIESIN: How many feet away am I from this
thing?

03:03:51.130 --> 03:03:55.038
MATT: You are 40, 45 feet from it.

03:03:55.038 --> 03:04:01.037
TALIESIN: I'm going to start dashing to that
next-- yeah, that direction.

03:04:01.037 --> 03:04:03.995
MATT: 30, that's your movement.

03:04:03.995 --> 03:04:10.832
TALIESIN: I'm going to do one more attempt at
Vicious Mockery. (Infernal noises)

03:04:10.832 --> 03:04:12.438
MATT: That's a 14.

03:04:12.438 --> 03:04:14.136
TALIESIN: He still saves?

03:04:14.136 --> 03:04:15.265
MATT: He still saves.

03:04:15.265 --> 03:04:16.804
TALIESIN. That's all right.

03:04:16.804 --> 03:04:17.998
MATT: That your turn?

03:04:17.998 --> 03:04:19.124
TALIESIN: That's what I got.

03:04:19.124 --> 03:04:26.161
MATT: Now it's the creature's turn. With you right
there in front of it, it's going to attempt to

03:04:26.161 --> 03:04:28.249
bite you, Yasha, with its giant mouth.

03:04:28.249 --> 03:04:31.279
LAURA: No, not its poop mouth!

03:04:31.279 --> 03:04:33.851
MATT: That is 16. What's your armor class?

03:04:33.851 --> 03:04:34.767
ASHLEY: 14.

03:04:34.767 --> 03:04:36.158
MATT: Aw, okay, hits you.

03:04:36.158 --> 03:04:37.679
MARISHA: Attack with my reaction!

03:04:37.679 --> 03:04:39.565
TRAVIS: Sentinel!

03:04:39.565 --> 03:04:51.304
MARISHA: Sentinel! Natural 20. Eight. 14.

03:04:51.304 --> 03:04:56.941
MATT: 14 does hit. You take 15 points of piercing
damage, and I need you to make a constitution

03:04:56.941 --> 03:04:57.927
saving throw.

03:04:57.927 --> 03:05:02.212
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm not going to use that one.

03:05:02.212 --> 03:05:08.417
SAM: Does the Enlarge give her advantage on saving
throws?

03:05:08.417 --> 03:05:09.731
MATT: Just strength.

03:05:09.731 --> 03:05:13.229
ASHLEY: Eight.

03:05:13.229 --> 03:05:22.670
MATT: Eight. Even in your enlarged state, the
diseased gathering of bacteria and terrible

03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:23.950
elements--

03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:25.018
ASHLEY: 15 points?

03:05:25.018 --> 03:05:29.810
MATT: 15 points. The poison courses through your
body, and Yasha, you are considered poisoned.

03:05:29.810 --> 03:05:31.903
ASHLEY: Oh, this sucks!

03:05:31.903 --> 03:05:35.149
MARISHA: It takes seven points of damage from the
unarmed strike.

03:05:35.149 --> 03:05:39.910
MATT: It does. It's going to take its tentacles
and swing one towards you, Jester.

03:05:39.910 --> 03:05:41.535
SAM: Oh no, Jessie!

03:05:41.535 --> 03:05:42.827
LAURA: Oh no!

03:05:42.827 --> 03:05:47.354
MATT: That is 23 to hit.

03:05:47.354 --> 03:05:48.904
LAURA: That hits me.

03:05:48.904 --> 03:05:56.727
MATT: As the tentacle swings out toward you,
clawing past you with its raking teeth-- oh shit.

03:05:56.727 --> 03:06:05.398
That's 11 points of bludgeoning damage plus eight
points of piercing damage as it carves into you.

03:06:05.398 --> 03:06:08.646
LAURA: I'm going to use Hellish Rebuke on him.

03:06:08.646 --> 03:06:09.942
MATT: Go for it.

03:06:09.942 --> 03:06:13.672
LAURA: Yeah, you still don't have any stupid arms,
stupid!

03:06:13.672 --> 03:06:20.592
MATT: You are also grappled, as the tentacle wraps
around you and begins to squeeze and hold you in

03:06:20.592 --> 03:06:26.201
place. The teeth and the thorns that are coming
out of the side of its tentacle jamming into your

03:06:26.201 --> 03:06:30.650
body. Is it a constitution save for Hellish
Rebuke?

03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:38.352
LAURA: Hellish Rebuke is a 2nd-level. I really
wish it gave more information about what--

03:06:38.352 --> 03:06:45.481
SAM: It will certainly be fixed, because D&amp;D
Beyond is a responsive company and we love them.

03:06:45.604 --> 03:06:50.982
LAURA: It doesn't say anywhere what Hellish
Rebuke-- oh there it is! Dexterity save!

03:06:50.982 --> 03:06:53.749
MATT: There we go. That is going to be a nine.

03:06:53.749 --> 03:06:55.674
LAURA: That means I get 3d10.

03:06:55.674 --> 03:06:57.114
MATT: 3d10 damage to it.

03:06:57.114 --> 03:06:58.395
MARISHA: Yes!

03:06:58.395 --> 03:07:02.305
TRAVIS: Rock that shit. Goodnight Irene, let's
go.

03:07:02.305 --> 03:07:06.009
LAURA: 12.

03:07:06.009 --> 03:07:15.074
MATT: 12 points of damage. Nice. There's a burst
of icy shards and blades that explode out of

03:07:15.074 --> 03:07:21.073
Jester into the tentacle and along the side of its
body as it pulls back in place, swinging its other

03:07:21.073 --> 03:07:23.800
tentacle out behind it towards Beau.

03:07:23.800 --> 03:07:28.518
LAURA: How much damage did you say I just took,
though? Because I was busy. 19 points of damage.

03:07:28.518 --> 03:07:30.133
SAM: 11 plus eight.

03:07:30.133 --> 03:07:41.378
MATT: With disadvantage, because you have defense.
Even with a disadvantage, that is 18.

03:07:41.378 --> 03:07:43.536
MARISHA: Fuck! Yeah.

03:07:43.536 --> 03:07:52.813
MATT: You suffer five points of bludgeoning
damage, plus three points of piercing, so eight

03:07:52.813 --> 03:07:56.384
total, and you are also grappled.

03:07:56.384 --> 03:08:02.067
LIAM: All of the male players are 40 feet back,
and all the women are right in there.

03:08:02.067 --> 03:08:10.227
MATT: Now you are poisoned and grappled. The two
side tentacles, and there's the one large tentacle

03:08:10.227 --> 03:08:15.532
on top which, now that you have a closer look, has
three vertical eyes in it that are glancing around

03:08:15.532 --> 03:08:20.599
and looking at the space. The two are wrapped
around two of your allies as Yasha's dealing with

03:08:20.599 --> 03:08:24.576
the poison wracking through her veins. That's
going to end its turn. Caleb, you're up.

03:08:24.576 --> 03:08:32.170
LIAM: I am very aware of how many people are in
this arena, especially high-powered ones, as I

03:08:32.170 --> 03:08:38.249
wrap one hand around my forearm and I cast
Scorching Ray even though I feel nauseous, and off

03:08:38.249 --> 03:08:39.390
they go.

03:08:39.390 --> 03:08:43.310
MATT: Go for it. Because it attacked Beau, you
could use your reaction to attack it back with

03:08:43.310 --> 03:08:44.890
your Sentinel feat.

03:08:44.890 --> 03:08:45.986
SAM: You have Sentinel also?

03:08:45.986 --> 03:08:46.980
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:08:46.980 --> 03:08:52.570
MATT: They both do. You have that. I'll let you do
it now if you wanted to, if you want to take it.

03:08:52.570 --> 03:08:53.860
ASHLEY: Fuck yes. Yes.

03:08:53.860 --> 03:08:56.060
LAURA: If you feel like attacking.

03:08:56.060 --> 03:08:57.964
MATT: You have disadvantage on the attack,
unfortunately.

03:08:57.964 --> 03:08:59.975
LIAM: 26, ten, 16.

03:08:59.975 --> 03:09:02.041
MATT: The first and the last one hit.

03:09:02.041 --> 03:09:18.778
ASHLEY: Natural 20. 13.

03:09:18.778 --> 03:09:23.587
MATT: 13 just misses. You swing, and as you're
about to hit with the blade, the poison pulses

03:09:23.587 --> 03:09:27.913
through your veins, and you go wide as the
creature manages to be out of range. How much

03:09:27.913 --> 03:09:29.206
damage is that?

03:09:29.206 --> 03:09:30.910
LIAM: 15 points of fire damage.

03:09:30.910 --> 03:09:37.687
MATT: Both rays slam into it and the flames burst
up, and you hear (pained gurgling), trying to pull

03:09:37.687 --> 03:09:41.385
back from the impact, but it's currently by the
wall, and it's holding onto your friends and

03:09:41.385 --> 03:09:43.703
holding its ground.

03:09:43.703 --> 03:09:49.990
LIAM: I'll take a step five feet that way and as I
do so I look over at Fjord and just-- and that's

03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:51.174
the end of my turn.

03:09:51.174 --> 03:09:52.558
TRAVIS: Big nope.

03:09:52.558 --> 03:09:54.409
MATT: That ends Caleb's go. Jester.

03:09:54.409 --> 03:09:55.821
LAURA: Oh, that's me!

03:09:55.821 --> 03:09:59.220
MATT: Yes. You are currently grappled, and while
you are grappled you are restrained until you

03:09:59.220 --> 03:10:00.292
break free.

03:10:00.292 --> 03:10:01.609
SAM: I think it's my turn.

03:10:01.609 --> 03:10:04.445
MATT: Oh, sorry, Nott's after Caleb, my bad. Thank
you.

03:10:04.445 --> 03:10:11.035
SAM: I'm going to stick my hand around and fire my
little crossy-bowy. Not good! Not good at all.

03:10:11.035 --> 03:10:12.236
Ten!

03:10:12.236 --> 03:10:17.072
MATT: Ten goes wide. As it's reeling back from the
blow of the flame jets from your buddy Caleb,

03:10:17.072 --> 03:10:21.707
unfortunately as you fire it moves just out of the
way, and the bolt goes wide.

03:10:21.707 --> 03:10:27.319
SAM: I will reload and fire again. Oh god! Should
we count that?

03:10:27.319 --> 03:10:29.519
LAURA: Yeah, I think so. What do you add to it?

03:10:29.519 --> 03:10:31.119
SAM: I don't know. Matt, do I count that or not?

03:10:31.119 --> 03:10:32.988
LAURA: It's 18. It landed in my box, but it landed
up.

03:10:32.988 --> 03:10:34.352
MATT: If it landed, then it's fine.

03:10:34.352 --> 03:10:35.774
SAM: Okay, 18 to hit.

03:10:35.774 --> 03:10:37.801
MATT: 18 does hit, so go ahead and roll damage and
sneak attack.

03:10:37.801 --> 03:10:39.069
SAM: I get sneak attack?

03:10:39.069 --> 03:10:40.574
MATT: It's still adjacent to a friend of yours.

03:10:40.574 --> 03:10:45.152
SAM: Great. 15.

03:10:45.271 --> 03:10:49.706
MATT: Nice, all right. It strikes on the inside of
the mouth.

03:10:49.836 --> 03:10:55.416
SAM: I'll take Fury of the Small, why not. 19.

03:10:55.416 --> 03:11:00.877
MATT: 19 points of damage total, got it. (bolt
impact, groaning) It looks like it's hurting, but

03:11:00.877 --> 03:11:06.195
it's also in control of the battlefield on that
side there. That ends your turn. Jester.

03:11:06.195 --> 03:11:07.690
SAM: Back behind a wall.

03:11:07.690 --> 03:11:12.753
LAURA: Oh god. Does it look like it's hurting at
all?

03:11:12.753 --> 03:11:14.452
MATT: It looks like it's hurt.

03:11:14.452 --> 03:11:18.993
LAURA: While I'm in its grasp, can I touch the
tentacle and cast Toll the Dead again?

03:11:18.993 --> 03:11:23.126
MATT: If you'd like to.

03:11:23.126 --> 03:11:25.015
SAM: If you think that would help.

03:11:25.015 --> 03:11:26.070
LAURA: I want to do that.

03:11:26.070 --> 03:11:33.720
MATT: Okay. The saving throw-- that's cocked. No,
that is a five plus one.

03:11:33.721 --> 03:11:40.710
LAURA: Okay. Two.

03:11:40.710 --> 03:11:45.431
MATT: Hey, it all helps. It all goes to the same
place. You are still restrained and held in place

03:11:45.431 --> 03:11:48.836
there. Anything else you want to do?

03:11:48.836 --> 03:11:50.974
LAURA: I probably should have tried to un-restrain
myself.

03:11:50.974 --> 03:11:54.113
SAM: You're a great player.

03:11:54.113 --> 03:11:57.145
MATT: No, it's an action to break free.

03:11:57.145 --> 03:12:01.073
LAURA: It's an action. Well, I already did it. I
already Tolled the Dead, so too late.

03:12:01.073 --> 03:12:02.256
MATT: End of your turn?

03:12:02.256 --> 03:12:03.250
LAURA: I guess so.

03:12:03.250 --> 03:12:04.184
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

03:12:04.184 --> 03:12:09.448
ASHLEY: I'm going to attack again.

03:12:09.448 --> 03:12:18.346
TALIESIN: There's no short rest between here
and--

03:12:18.346 --> 03:12:20.027
LAURA: There could be.

03:12:20.027 --> 03:12:22.007
MARISHA: No, there could be more groups, man.

03:12:22.007 --> 03:12:25.621
MATT: He said about 20 minutes between rounds, and
a short rest is an hour.

03:12:25.621 --> 03:12:28.798
ASHLEY: Do I have advantage on attack, or no?

03:12:28.798 --> 03:12:31.817
TRAVIS: If you go reckless, you can.

03:12:31.817 --> 03:12:34.888
ASHLEY: Yes, that's right, I haven't used reckless
yet. Shit.

03:12:34.888 --> 03:12:36.899
MATT: You have not used reckless. That gives you
advantage on your attacks.

03:12:36.899 --> 03:12:39.018
ASHLEY: That gives me advantage, but that gives
them advantage on attacks.

03:12:39.018 --> 03:12:41.751
MATT: Correct. For now it's a straight roll,
there's no disadvantage on that roll.

03:12:41.751 --> 03:12:43.562
ASHLEY: Sorry guys. Natural 20.

03:12:43.562 --> 03:12:46.467
TRAVIS: So nonchalant with that shit!

03:12:46.467 --> 03:12:59.717
MATT: That'll do it. That doubles your weapon and
the d4. You roll those together. It's whatever

03:12:59.717 --> 03:13:08.041
that is. It's your 2d6 for your weapon, d6 for
your divine ability, and then your die, so then

03:13:08.041 --> 03:13:13.739
double that. Roll those, double that, and then add
your plus seven.

03:13:13.739 --> 03:13:15.210
ASHLEY: I see.

03:13:15.210 --> 03:13:17.634
MATT: Ooh, no.

03:13:17.634 --> 03:13:24.508
LAURA: 17 times two is 34.

03:13:24.508 --> 03:13:25.899
TALIESIN: Plus seven.

03:13:25.899 --> 03:13:28.448
SAM: Whoa, that's a lot.

03:13:28.448 --> 03:13:29.590
ASHLEY: 41.

03:13:29.590 --> 03:13:30.732
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:13:30.732 --> 03:13:32.353
(cheering)

03:13:32.353 --> 03:13:33.460
ASHLEY: No way, really?

03:13:33.460 --> 03:13:34.963
MATT: Yeah, you fucking murdered it!

03:13:34.963 --> 03:13:39.252
ALL: (chanting) Yasha!

03:13:39.252 --> 03:13:41.211
SAM: Remember, you're twice as big.

03:13:41.211 --> 03:13:44.693
MATT: It's currently holding Jester and Beau, and
it looks like it's about to slam them together.

03:13:44.693 --> 03:13:49.820
It's pulling them back and their feet are dragging
off the ground and causing grooves in the sand,

03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:51.507
and it's (growling).

03:13:51.507 --> 03:13:55.183
ASHLEY: I want to take the blade, turn it down,
and straight into the middle of it.

03:13:55.183 --> 03:13:58.344
MATT: Which you can do, because at your full
height, you're about as tall as it is. In a

03:13:58.344 --> 03:14:02.674
downward angle, you thrust forward and jam it
right into the center of its membrane above its

03:14:02.674 --> 03:14:06.251
mouth. As you push down, you watch your blade
actually protrude out the roof of its mouth,

03:14:06.431 --> 03:14:10.527
through its mouth, through the tongue, and into
the rest of its body, and as you push, it gives

03:14:10.527 --> 03:14:17.331
this horrible squealing, guttural, swine-like
sound, and as you push, and push, and push, it

03:14:17.331 --> 03:14:21.280
falls onto its back, and you keep pushing, and you
keep pushing, and the tentacles go limp and

03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:28.524
release both Jester and Beau. At that point, you
pull the blade free, and it is not moving on the

03:14:28.524 --> 03:14:30.095
ground, bleeding out into the sand.

03:14:30.095 --> 03:14:32.700
ALL: Whoa!

03:14:32.700 --> 03:14:34.340
LAURA: That was amazing.

03:14:34.340 --> 03:14:35.813
MARISHA: That was fucking awesome.

03:14:35.813 --> 03:14:41.607
LAURA: I'm going to cast Thaumaturgy and start
whispers throughout the crowd going: (chanting)

03:14:41.607 --> 03:14:46.669
Yasha, Yasha! Hopefully the crowd picks it up.

03:14:46.669 --> 03:14:53.012
ASHLEY: I run back into the hidden area
immediately, and I don't stay out there.

03:14:53.012 --> 03:14:56.283
MATT: Okay, good to know. Enlarge lasts for how
long?

03:14:56.283 --> 03:15:02.157
LIAM: A minute, so probably the time it takes her
to cast that spell and you to run into that hole.

03:15:02.157 --> 03:15:05.424
Yasha, that should probably end right about (magic
fizzles).

03:15:05.424 --> 03:15:12.052
MATT: Your size is reduced to a more diminutive
stance. As you guys back into the inside, the

03:15:12.052 --> 03:15:13.645
poison, however, is still holding.

03:15:13.645 --> 03:15:17.770
SAM: Oh no. Can we use some medicine?

03:15:17.770 --> 03:15:27.245
LAURA: Yes. I've got one kit left so I'm going to
use my medicinal herbs on you, Beau, to get rid of

03:15:27.245 --> 03:15:28.227
the poison.

03:15:28.227 --> 03:15:30.455
MARISHA: Fuck yeah. Please.

03:15:30.455 --> 03:15:32.524
TRAVIS: Where are you at, Jester? Hit point-wise?

03:15:32.524 --> 03:15:36.240
LAURA: I'm very low, hit point-wise. I'm at 12 out
of 31.

03:15:36.240 --> 03:15:39.232
TRAVIS: You want a health potion?

03:15:39.232 --> 03:15:40.645
LAURA: Huh?

03:15:40.645 --> 03:15:42.391
TRAVIS: You want a health potion?

03:15:42.391 --> 03:15:45.687
LAURA: Oh, I can use my spells to heal us right
now.

03:15:45.687 --> 03:15:47.368
TRAVIS: I think you should save--

03:15:47.368 --> 03:15:54.668
LAURA: The only thing I have that can get rid of
poisoning is Lesser Restoration, which I can cast

03:15:54.668 --> 03:15:58.065
on Yasha right now. I can get rid of the poison on
you.

03:15:58.065 --> 03:16:02.029
SAM: Wait, but the poison will go away eventually,
right? Won't it?

03:16:02.029 --> 03:16:03.869
TALIESIN: Not before the next fight, I don't
think.

03:16:03.869 --> 03:16:04.975
MATT: You don't know.

03:16:04.975 --> 03:16:06.779
LAURA: It's probably--

03:16:06.779 --> 03:16:10.553
MATT: In your herbalism kit, you can make
antitoxin if you're in a space--

03:16:10.700 --> 03:16:14.177
LAURA: No, it's not an herbalism kit, it's
medicinal herbs, which you specifically told me it

03:16:14.177 --> 03:16:15.681
removes poison on action.

03:16:15.681 --> 03:16:20.216
MATT: Yes. It's a medicine check to apply it
properly, but you can do that.

03:16:20.216 --> 03:16:21.604
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:16:21.604 --> 03:16:22.835
SAM: Make that check!

03:16:22.835 --> 03:16:24.319
LAURA: Oh no.

03:16:24.319 --> 03:16:25.767
TALIESIN: What's your medicine check?

03:16:25.767 --> 03:16:27.577
LAURA: I'm proficient-- oh, that's good.

03:16:27.577 --> 03:16:30.334
SAM: A lot.

03:16:30.334 --> 03:16:32.802
LAURA: Yeah, it's a 23.

03:16:32.802 --> 03:16:38.673
MATT: Yeah. As you guys back into the corner, you
manage to go ahead and apply the medicinal herbs,

03:16:38.673 --> 03:16:43.309
which are used now, but the poison does manage to
fade from your body, Beau. You are no longer

03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:47.377
poisoned. You're using Lesser Restoration on
Yasha, you said? Up to you.

03:16:47.377 --> 03:16:48.556
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do it.

03:16:48.556 --> 03:16:52.085
MATT: Okay, the poison is removed, which is
probably a good thing because it lasts until

03:16:52.085 --> 03:16:55.377
cured.

03:16:55.377 --> 03:16:57.060
SAM: Oh wow!

03:16:57.060 --> 03:17:05.879
MATT: Technically, it's a disease that causes
poison, but because the nature of the herbs that

03:17:05.879 --> 03:17:09.751
you've utilized in this space, it fits in a
similar realm because it's a bacterial infection

03:17:09.751 --> 03:17:12.868
that kicks in. I'll say because you got to it
quickly enough and you rolled so high, you were

03:17:12.868 --> 03:17:14.154
able to do that.

03:17:14.154 --> 03:17:15.648
TRAVIS: Because you got stabbed with poop-teeth.

03:17:15.648 --> 03:17:17.515
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

03:17:17.611 --> 03:17:20.033
ASHLEY: Jester, what are you at, right now?

03:17:20.033 --> 03:17:21.831
LAURA: I'm at 12 hit points.

03:17:21.831 --> 03:17:23.752
SAM: You need to heal!

03:17:23.752 --> 03:17:26.003
ASHLEY: I give her a potion of healing.

03:17:26.003 --> 03:17:28.574
LAURA: Yasha, you need healing too!

03:17:28.574 --> 03:17:30.159
ASHLEY: No it's fine!

03:17:30.159 --> 03:17:32.350
LAURA: Are you sure?

03:17:32.350 --> 03:17:33.658
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm sure.

03:17:33.658 --> 03:17:35.709
MARISHA: I won't deny it, but I also won't request
it.

03:17:35.709 --> 03:17:37.658
TRAVIS: Yeah, fucking take it.

03:17:37.658 --> 03:17:38.664
MARISHA: Okay.

03:17:38.664 --> 03:17:42.584
LAURA: It's what? How many d4? 2d4?

03:17:42.584 --> 03:17:46.451
MATT: 2d4 plus two for a healing potion. As you
guys are in the process of doing this, you hear

03:17:46.451 --> 03:17:52.505
the voice shouting out-- not even realizing the
other group that walks outside. "The Mountain

03:17:52.505 --> 03:18:03.138
"Makers from Grimgolir!" The dwarf and gnome troupe
makes their way out into the field. As the crowd

03:18:03.138 --> 03:18:08.142
cheers, the emcee vanishes, and you see an opposing
side open once again. Immediately bursting

03:18:08.244 --> 03:18:14.897
through, you see a large, nine-foot troll with
elongated arms and legs start rushing into the

03:18:14.897 --> 03:18:20.837
fray, screaming this high-pitched yelp. As it
runs, you can see its skin, as opposed to the deep

03:18:20.837 --> 03:18:25.659
forest green that you've read about or seen in
trolls in your experiences, this looks like a dull

03:18:25.659 --> 03:18:30.657
teal-blue color. You watch as the dwarves, all of
a sudden, rush in. The gnomes begin casting

03:18:30.657 --> 03:18:38.207
spells, and this assault goes back and forth. You
see with each strike this cold mist off the claws

03:18:38.207 --> 03:18:46.582
of the troll with each blow. You watch as the
gnomes begin to apply fire upon fire, and you

03:18:46.582 --> 03:18:50.313
watch as the entity burns, their intelligent
knowledge of the creature causing it to prevent it

03:18:50.313 --> 03:18:55.170
from regenerating. Fairly rapidly, they make short
work of it. They were prepared, and it was not as

03:18:55.170 --> 03:18:59.784
intense a battle as you were expecting. With
that--

03:18:59.784 --> 03:19:02.180
TRAVIS: Did it look like they prepared anything
with fire before the creature came out?

03:19:02.180 --> 03:19:08.356
MATT: To your memory, you didn't know that. You
didn't notice anything. With the final of the

03:19:08.356 --> 03:19:12.691
battle, the cheers go wild, the crowd goes crazy,
and eventually, The Mountain Makers make their way

03:19:12.691 --> 03:19:16.966
back into the field. Anything else you guys needed
to prepare at this time?

03:19:16.966 --> 03:19:20.827
MARISHA: They had real good teamwork. Maybe we
should come up with special moves.

03:19:20.975 --> 03:19:22.731
SAM: Like what?

03:19:22.731 --> 03:19:24.319
TALIESIN: Like heal.

03:19:24.319 --> 03:19:30.860
SAM: Like don't run up so close, or at least wait
a little bit first to gauge the beast.

03:19:30.860 --> 03:19:32.000
MARISHA: What?

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:33.784
SAM: Don't run into the -- You're going to die!

03:19:33.784 --> 03:19:38.030
MATT: "Out from the Menagerie Coast! The Stubborn
Stock!"

03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:39.231
SAM: Oh, that's not us.

03:19:39.231 --> 03:19:46.052
MATT: Behind you, as the doors open, they move
past you. Darrow goes, "Hey, wish us luck, friends,"

03:19:46.052 --> 03:19:48.858
and enters into the sunlight.

03:19:48.858 --> 03:19:50.260
LAURA: Good luck!

03:19:50.260 --> 03:19:54.862
MATT: The doors close. Looking out past the way,
another door opens off to the side, and you watch

03:19:54.862 --> 03:20:02.238
as a 15-foot-long crocodile becomes barreling into
the center, its jaws opening and snapping as it

03:20:02.238 --> 03:20:07.390
comes rushing in. It climbs over the wall that the
guys are getting behind to defend and immediately

03:20:07.390 --> 03:20:11.876
snaps down on one of the soldiers, who gets hit in
the side and screams out in pain. They all begin

03:20:11.876 --> 03:20:15.943
to rush in and assault, jumping off the wall and
getting onto its back. You watch as Darrow climbs

03:20:15.943 --> 03:20:20.723
up onto it, taking a shortsword that one of his
friends had dropped, and jams it into the top of

03:20:20.723 --> 03:20:30.054
the head. As he pulls out his battleaxe, he begins
to hack away. He seems to be laughing. Another friend pries

03:20:30.054 --> 03:20:34.948
the mouth off of the one soldier that had been
stamped on. He limps away as it spins around, its

03:20:34.948 --> 03:20:38.529
tail slapping one of its friends, sending him
flying back ten feet as his weapon goes skidding

03:20:38.529 --> 03:20:42.676
into the sky. It hits the dirt off the way. He
runs to try and retrieve it. The battle goes back

03:20:42.676 --> 03:20:48.218
and forth for a while. One of their friends goes
down and one of his allies grabs and pulls him

03:20:48.218 --> 03:20:53.765
away from the battle zone as he begins to try and
wake him up. At this point, you watch as Darrow

03:20:53.765 --> 03:20:59.555
makes a couple of motions to his friends, and they
all cycle in and assault at one time, cutting at

03:20:59.555 --> 03:21:05.992
the throat of the large crocodile as Darrow takes
his axe and carves out one of its eyes. As it

03:21:05.992 --> 03:21:10.501
pulls back, screaming in pain, they both come
underneath and cut through the throat at the same

03:21:10.501 --> 03:21:14.985
time, causing it to bleed out. With that, the
crocodile collapses, not moving, into the field.

03:21:14.985 --> 03:21:18.869
MARISHA: Did you see that? He had a sign, and then
things happened.

03:21:18.869 --> 03:21:23.441
MATT: They slap awake their ally, and they begin
to drag themselves back into the chamber as the

03:21:23.441 --> 03:21:28.890
crowd's cheering. They're a little wounded and a
little winded, but as they come in, "Heh! That

03:21:28.890 --> 03:21:34.538
"wasn't too bad! You're on deck, I suppose!" They
bring their friend over to the side, and one--

03:21:34.538 --> 03:21:38.350
TRAVIS: They used cover really well. We should try
and hide ourselves better.

03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:41.247
SAM: I can make a box!

03:21:42.257 --> 03:21:44.284
TALIESIN: No, don't do that.

03:21:44.364 --> 03:21:48.022
SAM: I can actually make a 15 foot large box! We
could all fit in it!

03:21:48.022 --> 03:21:49.610
LAURA: I'm going to take a healing potion.

03:21:49.610 --> 03:21:51.296
TRAVIS: Nott had a great idea actually though. We
should keep our distance.

03:21:51.296 --> 03:21:53.813
SAM: Keep our distance. We don't know what door
they're coming out.

03:21:53.813 --> 03:21:54.505
TRAVIS: We don't.

03:21:54.505 --> 03:21:57.698
SAM: Did we see which door the last two monsters
came out of?

03:21:57.698 --> 03:22:01.100
MATT: The one that came out here. The crocodile
came out here.

03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:03.564
SAM: That was the last one?

03:22:03.564 --> 03:22:04.670
MATT: That was the last one.

03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:07.468
ASHLEY: What about the teal thing? What was the--
Who did The Mountain Makers fight?

03:22:07.468 --> 03:22:13.437
MATT: Oh, the ice troll! Sorry. The ice troll came
from this side there. They are changing--

03:22:13.744 --> 03:22:14.912
ASHLEY: They're changing.

03:22:14.912 --> 03:22:18.974
TRAVIS: You people that need to be up close, just
wait until it gets to you. Make him chase you for

03:22:18.974 --> 03:22:21.846
a bit. Use the cover. Let's put some damage on it
before--

03:22:22.486 --> 03:22:24.774
MARISHA: I could do that. I could be a
distraction--

03:22:24.774 --> 03:22:33.263
MATT: "To the front lines again! The Last Line!"
You see as the armored soldiers go back out there

03:22:33.263 --> 03:22:37.748
into the field. They get into the center. They
form a phalanx back to back in the center as they

03:22:37.748 --> 03:22:48.431
look around in any direction, and you hear
(grunting) (roaring) and two gates open. From each

03:22:48.431 --> 03:22:55.286
gate, two large-looking figures come charging out.
You see these sprinting, dark, humanoid creatures

03:22:55.286 --> 03:23:00.215
with giant horns out of the front of their head.
Two minotaurs come charging into the center.

03:23:00.215 --> 03:23:04.932
Immediately, they both break into two groups and
try to head them off, shields up. One of them gets

03:23:04.932 --> 03:23:09.191
thrown, taking the impact of the blow. Knocked
back onto his ass, three feet back. The other one

03:23:09.191 --> 03:23:13.834
gets gored immediately, the horns piercing his
armor and throwing him into the air. As this

03:23:13.834 --> 03:23:18.848
happens, you notice now they're both wielding
large axes, and they start cleaving into the

03:23:18.848 --> 03:23:22.931
opponents. They're giving up a good fight, and it
goes back and forth for a bit, but at one point

03:23:22.931 --> 03:23:28.220
you watch one drop, and another drop. A third one
gets grabbed and picked up and then broken over

03:23:28.220 --> 03:23:35.017
the knee of one of the minotaurs. At which point,
you see the elven general begins to look around

03:23:35.017 --> 03:23:40.923
nervously and starts waving his hand to call it
off just as one of them gores him from behind. He

03:23:40.923 --> 03:23:44.834
gets thrown ten feet, landing onto the ground
rolling, unconscious. His blade clattering in the

03:23:44.834 --> 03:23:53.052
dirt. There you see Gunther in the center with two
warhammers in his hands, blood down his face

03:23:53.052 --> 03:23:59.003
going, "Come on!" They both come charging in at
him from two different sides. Last minute, he

03:23:59.003 --> 03:24:03.769
darts backward, causing them to collide into each
other. As they're stunned, he rushes up and jams

03:24:03.769 --> 03:24:08.931
his hammer into the head of one of them. Once.
Twice. One of the minotaurs goes down, and right

03:24:08.931 --> 03:24:13.256
as he pulls back, the second minotaur gets him
from behind. You watch as a horn pierce where his

03:24:13.256 --> 03:24:20.751
liver is, and he falls unconscious on the ground.
They fall. The final minotaur roars up into the

03:24:20.751 --> 03:24:29.013
air and the whole crowd goes, "Oh!" You watch as
two groups come out with chains and manacles and

03:24:29.013 --> 03:24:34.836
manage to grapple and throw them down. The lasting
minotaur passes out in the chains and they drag

03:24:34.836 --> 03:24:40.594
him back off the field. The two clerics rush out
into the field and prevent death to those who are

03:24:40.594 --> 03:24:46.249
in the process of slipping. With that, The Last
Line is pulled back, the first fallen out here in

03:24:46.249 --> 03:24:46.838
the field.

03:24:46.838 --> 03:24:53.196
LAURA: That was intense. Would we be able to have
fought those two minotaurs?

03:24:53.196 --> 03:24:54.421
MARISHA and TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:24:54.421 --> 03:24:55.816
SAM: No! Of course not!

03:24:55.816 --> 03:24:59.466
MATT: "The first fallen in the tournament!"

03:24:59.466 --> 03:25:01.497
TALIESIN: Focus on one target at a time.

03:25:01.497 --> 03:25:12.559
MATT: "Let us greet back to the field, The Mighty
Nein!" The doors open once more.

03:25:14.219 --> 03:25:16.248
MARISHA: She's Cure Woundsing me!

03:25:16.681 --> 03:25:19.742
MATT: All righty. Where do you guys wish to be
placed?

03:25:21.472 --> 03:25:24.769
LAURA: Is it possible to climb up on one of the
walls?

03:25:25.489 --> 03:25:26.884
MATT: If you'd like to try.

03:25:26.884 --> 03:25:28.929
LAURA: I'm going to try and climb up on top of the
wall.

03:25:28.929 --> 03:25:30.597
MATT: Make an athletics check real fast.

03:25:30.597 --> 03:25:32.853
ASHLEY: Am I able to take a potion of healing?

03:25:32.853 --> 03:25:33.433
MATT: Yeah.

03:25:33.433 --> 03:25:35.839
LAURA: That's really good. This one, sure. Why
not.

03:25:35.839 --> 03:25:36.682
MATT: This one here?

03:25:36.682 --> 03:25:37.416
LAURA: Yeah.

03:25:37.416 --> 03:25:39.055
MATT: All righty.

03:25:39.055 --> 03:25:40.169
TALIESIN: I'll back up into that far corner.

03:25:40.169 --> 03:25:40.667
MATT: This one here?

03:25:40.667 --> 03:25:41.318
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:25:41.318 --> 03:25:42.663
LAURA: It's a 22.

03:25:42.663 --> 03:25:43.794
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

03:25:43.794 --> 03:25:44.791
MARISHA: I'll move here.

03:25:44.791 --> 03:25:45.390
MATT: Nott?

03:25:45.390 --> 03:25:48.341
SAM: Dead center. I'm going to cast Mage Hand.

03:25:48.341 --> 03:25:49.587
MATT: Okay. Yasha?

03:25:54.527 --> 03:25:56.130
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand by Caleb, actually.

03:25:56.130 --> 03:25:58.511
MATT: Okay. You're with Caleb there?

03:25:58.511 --> 03:25:59.258
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:25:59.258 --> 03:26:00.490
LAURA: Beau, ten points.

03:26:00.500 --> 03:26:02.613
MARISHA: Yes! I love you, Jester!

03:26:03.243 --> 03:26:17.295
MATT: All righty. As you guys all take your place,
two gates immediately open again. You hear two

03:26:17.295 --> 03:26:28.296
sources of this loud, deep (howling). Leaping
through both sides, you see two massive, white

03:26:28.296 --> 03:26:31.652
furred wolves come leaping through into a full
sprint.

03:26:31.652 --> 03:26:34.338
LAURA: I Invoke Duplicity in the middle of the--
next to Nott.

03:26:34.338 --> 03:26:39.787
MATT: From this side and this side here. You
Invoke Duplicity?

03:26:39.787 --> 03:26:41.173
LAURA: Yeah, next to Nott.

03:26:41.173 --> 03:26:45.317
MATT: Next to Nott. All righty, I need you all to
roll initiative.

03:26:45.317 --> 03:26:48.514
(screaming)

03:26:50.724 --> 03:26:52.315
MARISHA: Natural 20!

03:26:52.315 --> 03:26:53.645
LIAM: Natural one!

03:26:54.755 --> 03:26:57.522
MATT: Aw, Caleb. My dice fell.

03:26:58.482 --> 03:26:59.169
LIAM: Hundred dollars.

03:26:59.749 --> 03:27:10.539
MATT: Sorry, mic. All righty, for this new round,
25 to 20?

03:27:10.539 --> 03:27:11.251
TALIESIN: 21.

03:27:11.251 --> 03:27:11.980
MARISHA: 24.

03:27:11.980 --> 03:27:12.641
LAURA: 22.

03:27:12.641 --> 03:27:14.425
MATT: Oh shit. We have Beau--

03:27:14.425 --> 03:27:16.119
TRAVIS: Jester, and Molly.

03:27:16.119 --> 03:27:22.292
MATT: You got it. 20 to 15?

03:27:23.732 --> 03:27:29.454
ASHLEY: 15! I was just, I'll wait until the end.
Oh wait, I rolled high!

03:27:29.454 --> 03:27:33.580
MATT: All right then, it'd be Yasha. 15 to ten?

03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:36.161
TRAVIS: Oh no. No, that isn't me either.

03:27:36.161 --> 03:27:37.445
MATT: Ten to five?

03:27:37.445 --> 03:27:37.991
SAM: Nine.

03:27:39.221 --> 03:27:39.761
TRAVIS: Six.

03:27:40.231 --> 03:27:41.718
LAURA: Six again, Fjord?

03:27:41.718 --> 03:27:42.418
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:27:42.418 --> 03:27:43.411
MATT: All righty.

03:27:44.251 --> 03:27:45.700
SAM: Two for Caleb.

03:27:45.700 --> 03:27:47.074
MATT: Caleb at the bottom.

03:27:47.074 --> 03:27:49.144
LIAM: I rolled a natural one, so--.

03:27:49.144 --> 03:27:56.047
MATT: Top of the round, as the wolves begin to
emerge, Beau, you're up first.

03:27:56.453 --> 03:28:09.759
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to run (counting) 40, I
guess?

03:28:09.759 --> 03:28:10.509
MATT: All righty.

03:28:10.509 --> 03:28:12.005
ASHLEY: Look at the blood on there already.

03:28:12.005 --> 03:28:16.419
MARISHA: I'm-- Yeah, that's cool-- I'm going to
look at this one and I'm going to go, hey

03:28:16.419 --> 03:28:23.401
(whistles), go fetch! I'm going to throw my other
wooden sword at that one, and then I'm going to do

03:28:23.401 --> 03:28:25.118
Patient Defense.

03:28:25.118 --> 03:28:25.823
MATT: Okay.

03:28:25.823 --> 03:28:27.004
MARISHA: Right in the middle of them.

03:28:27.004 --> 03:28:28.347
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

03:28:28.347 --> 03:28:30.188
MARISHA: Animal handling.

03:28:32.248 --> 03:28:33.716
MATT: Just because I want to see what will
happen.

03:28:34.486 --> 03:28:41.325
MARISHA: I'm going to use this lucky die that this
Critter gave me! Okay! 20!

03:28:41.325 --> 03:28:43.157
MATT: Okay. You throw it.

03:28:44.737 --> 03:28:45.795
MARISHA: Come on boy!

03:28:45.795 --> 03:28:46.997
MATT: That's your action.

03:28:46.997 --> 03:28:48.928
MARISHA: Wait, what do you mean that's my action?

03:28:48.928 --> 03:28:50.711
MATT: Yeah, to get its attention and try and throw
it?

03:28:50.711 --> 03:28:52.859
MARISHA: I can't take a ki point to do Patient
Defense?

03:28:52.859 --> 03:28:54.157
MATT: Patient Defense is a bonus, you're fine.

03:28:54.157 --> 03:28:55.138
MARISHA: Okay, so Patient Defense.

03:28:55.138 --> 03:28:55.707
MATT: Yeah.

03:28:55.707 --> 03:28:57.179
MARISHA: That's it.

03:28:57.179 --> 03:28:58.793
MATT: All right, that ends Beau's turn. Jester,
you're up.

03:28:58.793 --> 03:29:02.939
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at the one
behind me!

03:29:02.939 --> 03:29:04.133
MATT: All righty.

03:29:05.243 --> 03:29:06.194
LAURA: That's a dex save.

03:29:06.744 --> 03:29:08.688
MATT: That's a failure. That is an eight.

03:29:08.688 --> 03:29:09.660
LAURA: Yes!

03:29:09.660 --> 03:29:10.886
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that one.

03:29:12.216 --> 03:29:14.486
LAURA: Five points of damage to him!

03:29:14.486 --> 03:29:16.302
MATT: Five points of damage, nice. All righty.

03:29:16.302 --> 03:29:17.505
SAM: Or her.

03:29:18.745 --> 03:29:21.724
MATT: As the divine flame burns up around it, it's
still running.

03:29:22.514 --> 03:29:28.943
LAURA: I'm going to make my Invoked Duplicity
Jester run right in the middle of the two walls,

03:29:28.943 --> 03:29:29.984
past Fjord.

03:29:29.984 --> 03:29:30.789
MATT: Right there?

03:29:30.789 --> 03:29:34.945
LAURA: Yeah, and she's going to start going
(gibberish).

03:29:34.945 --> 03:29:35.687
MATT: Okay.

03:29:35.687 --> 03:29:37.253
ASHLEY: Look at me, look at me!

03:29:37.253 --> 03:29:40.256
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Molly,
you're up.

03:29:40.256 --> 03:29:43.734
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a run towards the fake
Jester.

03:29:43.734 --> 03:29:47.197
MATT: All righty. 25. 30

03:29:47.197 --> 03:29:53.157
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's where I can get there. I'm
going to try and see if I can make Vicious Mockery

03:29:53.157 --> 03:29:53.772
work on this thing.

03:29:53.772 --> 03:29:54.762
MATT: You have line of sight.

03:29:54.762 --> 03:29:56.483
TALIESIN: I do have line of sight?

03:29:56.483 --> 03:30:00.071
MATT: That's a eight, so that hits.

03:30:00.071 --> 03:30:01.632
TALIESIN: (sinister voice) Bad doggy!

03:30:01.632 --> 03:30:03.500
(laughter)

03:30:04.030 --> 03:30:04.694
SAM: Butt turkey?

03:30:04.694 --> 03:30:10.731
TALIESIN: Yep, butt turkey, you heard me. That's
one point of psychic damage and it has

03:30:10.731 --> 03:30:12.786
disadvantage next attack.

03:30:12.786 --> 03:30:18.314
MATT: You got it. That ends Molly's turn. It is
now the wolves' turn. This one is going to run,

03:30:18.314 --> 03:30:26.852
pacing around this side, up into that range there.
It's going to rush up and partially pass through

03:30:26.852 --> 03:30:33.327
the Jester illusion, look back and see all that
crowd in front, in its area. It pulls back and its

03:30:33.327 --> 03:30:43.388
shoulders curl up and the fur expands and (deep
roar). You watch as a burst of freezing winter air

03:30:43.388 --> 03:30:46.276
blows out of its open mouth.

03:30:46.276 --> 03:30:48.744
LAURA and SAM: (groaning)

03:30:48.744 --> 03:30:52.049
MATT: That's going to get all three of you guys.

03:30:52.049 --> 03:30:56.781
(laughter)

03:30:56.781 --> 03:30:59.863
MATT: I need you all to make a dexterity saving
throw.

03:30:59.863 --> 03:31:01.205
LAURA: Even though I am high up?

03:31:01.205 --> 03:31:02.850
MATT: Yeah, it's a cone out in that direction.

03:31:06.490 --> 03:31:07.347
TRAVIS: Round two.

03:31:07.347 --> 03:31:08.004
LAURA: 20.

03:31:09.224 --> 03:31:09.851
MATT: That's a success.

03:31:09.851 --> 03:31:10.709
LIAM: Four.

03:31:10.709 --> 03:31:12.223
MATT: Nope. Yasha?

03:31:12.893 --> 03:31:13.757
ASHLEY: Natural one.

03:31:13.757 --> 03:31:14.907
MATT: Okay!

03:31:14.907 --> 03:31:16.784
(laughter)

03:31:17.684 --> 03:31:20.297
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me. Oh god.

03:31:20.297 --> 03:31:25.562
MATT: 16 points of cold damage to Yasha and Caleb
and eight points to you, Jester.

03:31:26.209 --> 03:31:27.449
LAURA: Already? Eight points to me?

03:31:27.449 --> 03:31:28.228
MATT: Yes.

03:31:28.228 --> 03:31:29.939
LAURA: Halved because I'm resistant to cold
damage.

03:31:29.939 --> 03:31:37.432
MATT: Exactly, so four. The other one is going to
(galloping noises) turn around--

03:31:37.432 --> 03:31:38.180
MARISHA: What?!

03:31:38.180 --> 03:31:40.452
MATT: It's not going for a wooden sword.

03:31:42.222 --> 03:31:44.218
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 20!

03:31:44.218 --> 03:31:45.681
LIAM: You can certainly try.

03:31:45.681 --> 03:31:51.705
MATT: It saw it for a moment. It's going to move,
rush up here.

03:31:51.705 --> 03:31:56.441
MARISHA: That was a ki point! A very valuable ki
point!

03:31:56.441 --> 03:32:02.257
MATT: It was running out and you whistled and it
went (grunt) and kept running.

03:32:02.257 --> 03:32:02.717
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:32:04.487 --> 03:32:08.571
MATT: It's going to go ahead and blast another
cold air bit in that direction that will go for

03:32:08.571 --> 03:32:14.105
both Molly and Fjord. I need you both to roll
dexterity saving throws, please.

03:32:15.235 --> 03:32:15.904
LAURA: Roll high.

03:32:17.224 --> 03:32:17.911
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:32:19.481 --> 03:32:19.989
LAURA: Oh no.

03:32:21.729 --> 03:32:22.359
TALIESIN: Eight.

03:32:22.359 --> 03:32:23.328
TRAVIS: 12.

03:32:23.328 --> 03:32:25.112
MATT: You barely succeed!

03:32:25.112 --> 03:32:25.854
TRAVIS: Ooh!

03:32:25.854 --> 03:32:34.241
MATT: Molly does not. That is 26 points of cold
damage to you, Molly. I rolled really well on that.

03:32:34.525 --> 03:32:35.246
SAM: Oh, jeez!

03:32:35.246 --> 03:32:36.957
MATT: That's 13 to you, Fjord.

03:32:36.957 --> 03:32:39.640
LAURA: 26 points?

03:32:39.640 --> 03:32:41.132
TALIESIN: I am not resistant to cold.

03:32:41.132 --> 03:32:42.647
MATT: You are not, unfortunately, no.

03:32:42.647 --> 03:32:44.580
TRAVIS: 13, yeah okay.

03:32:44.580 --> 03:32:45.398
TALIESIN: Ow!

03:32:45.398 --> 03:32:46.209
SAM: Wait! You're out?

03:32:46.209 --> 03:32:48.477
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine. I'm not fine but ow!

03:32:48.477 --> 03:32:57.004
MATT: Yeah, and as it finishes blowing, it growls
in place. That's going to end its turn.

03:32:58.714 --> 03:32:59.488
SAM: Damn.

03:33:00.258 --> 03:33:03.267
MATT: Yeah, so that will bring us to the next
round. That's Yasha, you're up.

03:33:03.657 --> 03:33:04.301
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:33:04.301 --> 03:33:08.118
SAM: (shouting) Pick one and focus fire on that
one!

03:33:08.118 --> 03:33:25.729
ASHLEY: Okay, so reckless. Let me see something
here. Sorry. Where's the hex? Divine Fury? Can I

03:33:25.729 --> 03:33:26.785
do that as well?

03:33:26.785 --> 03:33:27.804
MATT: All righty. Go for it.

03:33:27.804 --> 03:33:29.016
LAURA: Are you raging?

03:33:29.016 --> 03:33:30.355
ASHLEY: I don't have any more.

03:33:30.355 --> 03:33:31.026
LAURA: Oh no!

03:33:31.026 --> 03:33:31.549
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:33:33.769 --> 03:33:36.970
SAM: You raged too much in the games of chance.

03:33:36.970 --> 03:33:39.513
ASHLEY: Wait, do I have advantage, or that's it?

03:33:39.513 --> 03:33:42.541
MATT: You have advantage with your attacks, if
you're reckless.

03:33:42.541 --> 03:33:45.507
ASHLEY: Sorry. Natural 20 again.

03:33:45.507 --> 03:33:47.262
(cheering)

03:33:47.262 --> 03:33:47.963
MATT: That will hit!

03:33:50.483 --> 03:33:51.916
ASHLEY: Divine Fury is an extra--

03:33:51.916 --> 03:33:52.510
MATT: d6.

03:33:52.510 --> 03:33:55.513
TALIESIN: Ah! Should have had disadvantage.

03:33:55.513 --> 03:33:57.750
MATT: Disadvantage doesn't affect it. It's a
cone.

03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:59.229
TALIESIN: It's a cone? Yeah, okay.

03:33:59.229 --> 03:33:59.675
MATT: Sorry.

03:33:59.675 --> 03:34:00.408
TALIESIN: All right.

03:34:02.538 --> 03:34:05.534
ASHLEY: Ugh. (counting) Eight.

03:34:05.534 --> 03:34:09.340
MATT: See, technically it would be-- It was a
natural 20? You only roll three of those dice.

03:34:09.900 --> 03:34:11.805
ASHLEY: Well, is Divine Fury an extra d6.

03:34:11.805 --> 03:34:13.015
MATT: Yes, that's how it is.

03:34:13.015 --> 03:34:14.773
ASHLEY: It's three, I'm sorry.

03:34:14.773 --> 03:34:17.960
MATT: Roll again, that's fine. It's 2d6 reroll.
It's okay.

03:34:18.510 --> 03:34:22.246
ASHLEY: Okay. (counting) Seven, ten, 27.

03:34:22.246 --> 03:34:27.916
MATT: 27 points of damage! You carve a hefty chunk
out of this wolf as you slam down with your blade.

03:34:27.916 --> 03:34:33.413
As it carves past, you see where the white fur has
now become red on its left side. It (whimpers)

03:34:33.413 --> 03:34:38.197
pulls back from the pain. Part of its flesh is
flapping from the wound you left as you draw the

03:34:38.197 --> 03:34:43.492
blade back. That was a pretty hefty hit. That ends
Yasha's turn. Nott, you're up.

03:34:43.492 --> 03:34:45.615
SAM: Okay, I'm going to aim for that flap of
skin.

03:34:45.615 --> 03:34:46.807
MATT: Fjord, you're up next.

03:34:46.807 --> 03:34:49.405
SAM: Fire. 25 to hit.

03:34:49.405 --> 03:34:50.688
MATT: That definitely hits.

03:34:53.738 --> 03:34:56.871
SAM: That is 16 points of damage.

03:34:56.871 --> 03:34:58.910
MATT: 16 points of damage. Beautiful!

03:34:58.910 --> 03:35:04.318
SAM: I will run. Nope, I will fire again.
(reloading) Same place.

03:35:04.318 --> 03:35:05.589
MATT: Go for it.

03:35:05.589 --> 03:35:06.666
SAM: 16 to hit.

03:35:06.666 --> 03:35:08.000
MATT: That hits! Roll damage.

03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:10.272
SAM: Six points.

03:35:12.522 --> 03:35:17.507
MATT: Six to that guy. As both bolts hit the open
wound that Yasha left behind, it's now starting to

03:35:17.507 --> 03:35:22.186
growl and look like it's in pain and is getting
cornered-animal angry.

03:35:22.186 --> 03:35:28.951
SAM: I'm going to run this way, as far as my
little-- well, so I can still see everybody and

03:35:28.951 --> 03:35:29.754
the action.

03:35:29.754 --> 03:35:32.979
MATT: All right, that ends Nott's turn. Fjord,
you're up.

03:35:32.979 --> 03:35:42.425
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on
myself, and I'm going to use my bonus action to

03:35:42.425 --> 03:35:53.899
cast Hex on the wolf that's nearest to Yasha and
give it disadvantage on dexterity checks. I'm

03:35:53.899 --> 03:35:58.131
going to use my movement to run towards that
wolf.

03:35:58.131 --> 03:35:59.064
MATT: This wolf here?

03:35:59.064 --> 03:35:59.575
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:35:59.575 --> 03:36:00.828
MATT: You can get there.

03:36:00.828 --> 03:36:02.156
TRAVIS: In between Molly and Yasha.

03:36:02.156 --> 03:36:07.883
MATT: The one that you run away from does snap at
you with its maw. I know you guys love that word.

03:36:07.883 --> 03:36:15.007
I know I do. That is going to be a nine. That does
not hit, it's a three plus six. Its jaws snap

03:36:15.007 --> 03:36:21.503
behind you and you hear the impact, but it's too
far below you. That ends Fjord's go. Caleb, you're up.

03:36:22.473 --> 03:36:31.911
LIAM: I pull out a cat's paw and say: (stuttering)
Bad dog. Maximilian's Grasping Cat's Claw comes

03:36:31.911 --> 03:36:37.224
out by that one there. It has to make a strength
saving throw.

03:36:38.014 --> 03:36:38.799
MATT: This one here?

03:36:38.799 --> 03:36:40.284
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but it has to save.

03:36:40.284 --> 03:36:45.012
MATT: Strength saving throw. That is going to be a
12. What's your DC?

03:36:45.012 --> 03:36:45.621
LIAM: 15.

03:36:45.621 --> 03:36:54.672
MATT: 15, no. He is held in place. As the hand
creeps up and grabs it, it (yelps) and it's held

03:36:54.672 --> 03:37:00.234
in place now, up off the ground, its paws held as
this giant caw paw is holding the doggy.

03:37:00.234 --> 03:37:06.424
LIAM: <i>Und</i> I will move that ways to make a
triangle with the two dogs and myself to get as

03:37:06.424 --> 03:37:08.025
far away as I can get.

03:37:09.235 --> 03:37:10.419
MARISHA: What does restraining it do?

03:37:10.419 --> 03:37:14.501
LIAM: Everyone gets advantage on it and it's at
disadvantage to hit us.

03:37:14.501 --> 03:37:15.847
SAM: That's great!

03:37:17.217 --> 03:37:20.506
MATT: That ends Caleb's turn. At the top, Beau,
you're up. Jester, you're up next.

03:37:20.506 --> 03:37:23.947
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to look around with my
defensive stance and be like "Aw, fucking really?"

03:37:23.947 --> 03:37:31.508
and then go: Parkour! Stab!

03:37:31.508 --> 03:37:33.249
LAURA: No, attack the one that's by all of us!

03:37:33.249 --> 03:37:35.262
MARISHA: No, this guy's got advantage!

03:37:35.262 --> 03:37:37.622
TRAVIS: Stay out of the cone, get on the
backside.

03:37:37.622 --> 03:37:40.605
MARISHA: It's fine! Oh, wait, that guy's cone?

03:37:40.605 --> 03:37:41.966
MATT: You're already there.

03:37:43.216 --> 03:37:44.420
MARISHA: Well, it's on.

03:37:44.420 --> 03:37:45.965
MATT: You're there. You have advantage on your
strikes, though.

03:37:45.965 --> 03:37:54.855
MARISHA: I'm coming down very hard and heavy.
Advantage. I'll take that natural 19, and then for

03:37:54.855 --> 03:37:57.670
my second one-- advantage on all of them?

03:37:57.670 --> 03:37:59.343
MATT: Yeah, because it's restrained.

03:37:59.343 --> 03:38:01.417
MARISHA: I'll take that 13?

03:38:01.417 --> 03:38:03.502
MATT: 13 just hits.

03:38:03.502 --> 03:38:13.548
MARISHA: Okay, so the first one: not great, six
damage? Second one: better, eight damage.

03:38:13.548 --> 03:38:20.353
MATT: Eight damage, all righty. As you leap over,
slamming your fist down-- or, your staff down-- on

03:38:20.353 --> 03:38:25.155
the nostril of the restrained wolf, and then as
you land, hit it with the back of your elbow. It

03:38:25.155 --> 03:38:28.652
takes the impact, but it can't move anywhere; it's
held in place by this magical--

03:38:28.652 --> 03:38:30.256
MARISHA: Do I still have a little bit of
movement?

03:38:30.256 --> 03:38:31.001
MATT: You do.

03:38:31.001 --> 03:38:32.509
MARISHA: Can I move behind it a little bit?

03:38:32.509 --> 03:38:34.450
MATT: It would be-- Yeah.

03:38:34.450 --> 03:38:38.182
LIAM: Oh, also, sorry. It takes bludgeoning damage
from the attack that I gave it.

03:38:38.182 --> 03:38:44.355
MATT: Roll damage for that, please. You're trying
to move around it? You have about 15 more feet of

03:38:44.355 --> 03:38:45.591
movement, I'll say.

03:38:45.591 --> 03:38:51.814
MARISHA: Can I come right here to it? You know
what-- nah, it's fine. Whatever works, it's all

03:38:51.814 --> 03:38:53.582
good. I'm into it all.

03:38:53.582 --> 03:38:54.273
LIAM: Six.

03:38:54.273 --> 03:38:59.313
MATT: Six damage, got it. That ends Beau's turn.
Jester, you're up. Molly, you're on deck.

03:38:59.313 --> 03:39:04.631
LAURA: Having seen Beau do that just then and it
looked really cool, I'm going to jump off the wall

03:39:04.631 --> 03:39:08.977
with my handaxe in my hand and try to come down
onto the back of the one right there.

03:39:08.977 --> 03:39:10.813
MATT: Okay, so you're going to run across the
wall?

03:39:10.813 --> 03:39:11.864
MARISHA: Hardcore parkour!

03:39:16.764 --> 03:39:25.288
LAURA: That is a 17 to hit! Nine points of
damage!

03:39:25.288 --> 03:39:28.060
MATT: Nine points of slashing damage against this,
nice.

03:39:28.060 --> 03:39:31.516
MARISHA: Fighting's more epic when you're flying
through the air!

03:39:34.486 --> 03:39:39.446
MATT: As you carve down with the axe and it cuts
through, it yelps again. You guys are cutting it

03:39:39.446 --> 03:39:44.040
up pretty bad. It's hurting. It's not on death's
door or anything, but it's hurting. Its fur is

03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:48.580
starting to get matted with its own blood with
each blow. That ends Jester's turn-- or, anything

03:39:48.580 --> 03:39:49.744
else you want to do with your turn?

03:39:49.744 --> 03:39:53.463
LAURA: Can I back up? Is it going to get an attack
of opportunity?

03:39:53.463 --> 03:39:54.616
MATT: Only one way to find out.

03:39:54.616 --> 03:39:56.216
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: That's a yes.

03:39:56.216 --> 03:40:03.338
LAURA: Oh no! Well, I'm going to move around him.
I'm going to move to his tail. To the pillar, yeah.

03:40:03.343 --> 03:40:08.031
MATT: Okay, you're right up against the pillar,
we'll say. That ends your turn, Jester. Molly,

03:40:08.031 --> 03:40:08.695
you're up.

03:40:08.695 --> 03:40:12.400
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a slashing attack at
the guy right in front of me.

03:40:12.400 --> 03:40:13.070
MATT: Okay.

03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:17.195
TALIESIN: That's-- oh, goddamn it-- that's 12 to
hit?

03:40:17.195 --> 03:40:21.354
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately. It ducks out
of the way.

03:40:21.354 --> 03:40:25.132
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit it again. Oh my god,
it's a natural fucking one.

03:40:25.132 --> 03:40:30.390
(mix of cheers and groans)

03:40:31.740 --> 03:40:37.387
MATT: You're trying to swing at it, but
unfortunately, for some reason, the howl of its

03:40:37.387 --> 03:40:42.045
presence and it moving so quickly in front of you
throws you off and your blades are not going well.

03:40:42.046 --> 03:40:51.466
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and circle around a
little bit to space everybody out a bit.

03:40:53.476 --> 03:40:56.526
MATT: That ends your turn, Molly. It's now the
wolf's turn. Let's see if they get their breath

03:40:56.526 --> 03:40:59.852
back. Nope and nope, neither of them do!

03:41:00.452 --> 03:41:01.173
TRAVIS: Huge!

03:41:04.723 --> 03:41:10.514
MATT: They are both going to make a single bite
attack. One of them is going to be, let's see,

03:41:10.514 --> 03:41:13.787
against you, Yasha. You did the most amount of
damage to it, so it's going to make a bite attack

03:41:13.787 --> 03:41:14.390
against you.

03:41:14.390 --> 03:41:14.792
SAM: No!

03:41:14.792 --> 03:41:20.431
MATT: That is going to be-- and it has advantage,
since you used your reckless. That's going to be--

03:41:20.431 --> 03:41:23.305
TALIESIN: It still has disadvantage from the-- for
its attack, though.

03:41:25.485 --> 03:41:28.884
MATT: Right, so it would have been the first
strike. That would be a total of 14. What's your

03:41:28.884 --> 03:41:29.487
armor class?

03:41:29.487 --> 03:41:29.834
ASHLEY: 14.

03:41:29.834 --> 03:41:41.877
MATT: Aw, just hits! That would be 12 points of
piercing damage as it bites down on you with its

03:41:42.126 --> 03:41:46.972
giant jaws. I need you to make a strength saving
throw, which you do not have advantage, currently,

03:41:46.972 --> 03:41:48.987
because you're not raging.

03:41:49.737 --> 03:41:51.212
SAM: You're still strong.

03:41:51.212 --> 03:41:56.318
LIAM: Super buff, and not just in the game.

03:41:58.718 --> 03:41:59.607
ASHLEY: 24.

03:41:59.607 --> 03:42:04.430
MATT: Success, it does not knock you prone. It
bites and tries to throw you onto the ground, but

03:42:04.430 --> 03:42:07.520
you push off of its jaws and use the back of the
wall to steel yourself and kick its mouth off of

03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:15.495
you and still stand there, resolute, with your
blade in hand. The other one is going to attempt

03:42:15.495 --> 03:42:19.771
to break free. It does not like being held in
place by there. What does it have to roll to break free?

03:42:20.426 --> 03:42:20.993
LIAM: 15.

03:42:20.993 --> 03:42:22.707
MATT: 15? What kind of check?

03:42:22.707 --> 03:42:23.776
LIAM: Oh, strength.

03:42:23.776 --> 03:42:33.122
MATT: Strength? 13 plus four, that's 17, yeah. It
manages to break free of the hand.

03:42:33.122 --> 03:42:35.033
LIAM: That's its action, correct, to break free?

03:42:35.033 --> 03:42:42.167
MATT: That's its action, correct. It will move
over here to flank up right there. Beau, you do

03:42:42.167 --> 03:42:45.767
get an attack of opportunity as it moves out of
the space, and if you hit it, it does prevent it

03:42:45.767 --> 03:42:46.287
from moving.

03:42:46.287 --> 03:42:50.942
MARISHA: (singing) It does! 14!

03:42:50.942 --> 03:42:51.818
MATT: 14 hits.

03:42:51.818 --> 03:42:53.820
(cheering)

03:42:53.820 --> 03:42:58.719
MATT: It gets dragged back. It does not get into
melee with the rest of your friends as you grab

03:42:58.719 --> 03:43:01.253
that tail and then pull it back.

03:43:01.253 --> 03:43:09.570
MARISHA: Yeah, that's eight damage. It's like a
Looney Tunes cartoon. My heels are dug in.

03:43:09.570 --> 03:43:12.471
MATT: As you're pulling the tail, it's screaming.

03:43:12.973 --> 03:43:15.298
MARISHA: Show me your belly!

03:43:15.298 --> 03:43:17.404
LIAM: It felt its gooch almost rip out.

03:43:17.404 --> 03:43:20.624
(sympathetic groans)

03:43:20.624 --> 03:43:22.401
MATT: That's going to end their turn. Yasha,
you're up.

03:43:22.401 --> 03:43:27.887
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to take another attack.
Wait, I'm within ten-- oh, yeah, I'm right next to

03:43:27.887 --> 03:43:29.020
Fjord, huh?

03:43:29.020 --> 03:43:29.562
MATT: Yeah.

03:43:36.242 --> 03:43:37.671
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to take another
attack.

03:43:37.671 --> 03:43:38.885
MATT: Go for it.

03:43:38.885 --> 03:43:40.865
ASHLEY: Reckless, all the stuffs.

03:43:40.865 --> 03:43:42.413
LAURA: How you want to do this!

03:43:42.413 --> 03:43:43.749
ASHLEY: Natural one.

03:43:43.749 --> 03:43:45.529
MATT: Good thing you went reckless.

03:43:45.529 --> 03:43:46.599
ASHLEY: Natural 20!

03:43:46.599 --> 03:43:50.537
(cheering)

03:43:50.537 --> 03:43:56.984
MATT: Jesus! I think you found your snitch!

03:44:00.274 --> 03:44:16.479
ASHLEY: Okay. Nine, 18 (counting) 25 points of
damage.

03:44:16.479 --> 03:44:17.480
MATT: 25 points.

03:44:17.720 --> 03:44:19.890
ASHLEY: Probably still not enough.

03:44:19.890 --> 03:44:20.750
MATT: No, how do you want to do this?

03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:23.583
(cheering)

03:44:23.583 --> 03:44:26.734
ASHLEY: I want to grab over his head, rip--

03:44:26.734 --> 03:44:30.761
MATT: Technically, it's not plus two with rage,
because it's not plus seven, right? Because you

03:44:30.761 --> 03:44:32.004
weren't raging.

03:44:32.004 --> 03:44:33.049
ASHLEY: Say that again?

03:44:33.049 --> 03:44:33.751
MATT: It's 23.

03:44:33.751 --> 03:44:34.498
ASHLEY: It's 23, okay.

03:44:34.498 --> 03:44:37.758
MATT: Because you're not raging, remember. There
is two damage from that you don't have on the plus

03:44:37.758 --> 03:44:38.519
seven, so it's plus five.

03:44:38.519 --> 03:44:39.190
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:44:39.730 --> 03:44:42.223
MATT: Still enough to finish it, but I wanted to
let you know.

03:44:42.223 --> 03:44:44.543
ASHLEY: Wait, what's the plus five-- break it down
again?

03:44:44.543 --> 03:44:50.269
MATT: It's plus three for strength, plus two for
your Divine Fury, and then plus two for your rage

03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:53.026
damage-- that makes it plus seven, but you're not
raging.

03:44:53.026 --> 03:44:55.018
ASHLEY: Okay, right, I see what you're saying.

03:44:55.018 --> 03:44:57.754
MATT: It had 22 hitpoints left, so you still
manage to carve it down.

03:44:57.754 --> 03:45:00.054
(relieved groaning)

03:45:00.054 --> 03:45:07.375
ASHLEY: Okay, sorry. I need to write all these
down in my notes later so we don't have to keep

03:45:07.375 --> 03:45:15.163
going through this. I'm going to go over the top
of his head and force his jaw open and then take

03:45:15.163 --> 03:45:19.378
my blade and put it through its mouth, straight
through its mouth. Skewer it.

03:45:19.378 --> 03:45:25.044
MATT: As the blade carves through, you hear it
yelp, and its growl turns into this low, guttural

03:45:25.044 --> 03:45:29.866
(fading growl), and goes limp in your grip as you
push it and draw the blade from its body. It

03:45:29.866 --> 03:45:36.137
slumps onto the ground, right at the base of
Jester. Molly, you both take a step back as the

03:45:36.137 --> 03:45:39.561
body slumps to the ground, no longer moving. Hex
is off.

03:45:42.251 --> 03:45:43.838
LAURA: I pet him and say: Good doggy.

03:45:47.238 --> 03:45:50.012
MATT: That's the end of Yasha's turn. Nott, you're
up.

03:45:51.992 --> 03:45:58.760
SAM: I do what I always do, I fire my crossbow at
the beast, for a 14 to hit?

03:45:58.760 --> 03:45:59.957
MATT: That hits.

03:45:59.957 --> 03:46:02.694
SAM: All right-- ooh, and it's sneak--

03:46:02.694 --> 03:46:04.273
LAURA: It is definitely sneak attack.

03:46:04.273 --> 03:46:07.726
SAM: Oh, 12 points of damage.

03:46:07.726 --> 03:46:10.111
MATT: 12 points of damage to it, all right.

03:46:10.111 --> 03:46:13.416
SAM: How's everyone-- is everyone alive right
now?

03:46:13.416 --> 03:46:14.780
LAURA: Everyone's up.

03:46:14.780 --> 03:46:16.736
TALIESIN: Barely. Yasha could use some healing.

03:46:16.736 --> 03:46:19.570
SAM: Yasha's right next to me-- I mean Beau.

03:46:19.570 --> 03:46:21.342
LIAM: Ah, couldn't see her behind the wall.

03:46:21.342 --> 03:46:25.305
SAM: I will do the same thing. I will reload and
fire again.

03:46:25.305 --> 03:46:26.169
MATT: Go for it.

03:46:26.169 --> 03:46:27.946
SAM: That's a miss. Ten points.

03:46:27.946 --> 03:46:29.522
MATT: Ten to attack, you mean?

03:46:29.522 --> 03:46:30.397
SAM: Ten to attack.

03:46:30.397 --> 03:46:32.888
MATT: (arrow firing sound) It goes too wide. It
hits the stone behind, almost hitting Beau. You're

03:46:32.888 --> 03:46:35.483
like (scattering sound) as it sparks off the
stone. No impact.

03:46:37.493 --> 03:46:41.095
SAM: I'll duck behind the wall and hide like a
weakling.

03:46:41.765 --> 03:46:45.232
MATT: There you go. Nott the Brave, by the name.
Fjord, you're up.

03:46:45.232 --> 03:46:52.929
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I transfer my
Hex onto this wolf, and can I start running around

03:46:52.929 --> 03:46:58.298
to get to its right hindquarter? Staying in melee,
but getting on its rear.

03:46:58.298 --> 03:47:00.088
MATT: Oh, you're going in melee with it?

03:47:00.088 --> 03:47:00.675
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:47:00.675 --> 03:47:02.281
MATT: All right, so you move there.

03:47:02.281 --> 03:47:06.881
TRAVIS: Can I keep coming this way a little bit
more? Yeah, right there. I reach back, and as I

03:47:06.881 --> 03:47:11.728
start to swing my hand up, I'll summon the
Wastehunter falchion and slice up through it.

03:47:13.008 --> 03:47:17.378
MATT: As the blade appears in the hand, you see a
blast of greenish energy as the blade apparates

03:47:17.378 --> 03:47:23.495
out of his grip. As he swings upward, it sends an
arc of seawater splashing into the air. Go ahead

03:47:23.495 --> 03:47:24.457
and roll for an attack.

03:47:24.457 --> 03:47:26.842
LAURA: Both me and my invoked Jester go: Ooh.

03:47:27.512 --> 03:47:29.538
TRAVIS: That's 26 to hit.

03:47:29.538 --> 03:47:30.944
MATT: That definitely hits.

03:47:30.944 --> 03:47:33.798
LIAM: Is this the same sword we've always seen? I
don't remember the word-- Liam doesn't remember

03:47:33.798 --> 03:47:34.732
the word Wastehunter.

03:47:34.732 --> 03:47:36.730
MATT: Same sword, looks a little different.

03:47:36.730 --> 03:47:38.564
TRAVIS: 13 points of damage.

03:47:38.564 --> 03:47:40.199
MATT: 13 points of damage to it.

03:47:40.199 --> 03:47:45.284
TRAVIS: One d6 necrotic for another four, so 17
total.

03:47:46.754 --> 03:47:52.360
MATT: As you arc upward, it cuts upward, the
splash of seawater mixed with the arc of blood

03:47:52.360 --> 03:47:57.750
from the wound. The way you carved up hits the
back of its thigh, and one leg collapses for a

03:47:57.750 --> 03:48:03.569
second and it looks over at you with these angry,
piercing blue eyes. It's looking pretty hurt. It's

03:48:03.569 --> 03:48:08.730
limping to that side, now. You guys see that the
falchion has a slight curve to it and has a hooked

03:48:08.730 --> 03:48:14.167
end to the back of its design. That finishes your
turn, Fjord. Caleb, you're up.

03:48:14.167 --> 03:48:20.130
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, just deadpan, I do this around my hand
and I cast three Scorching Rays out of it at this

03:48:20.130 --> 03:48:27.071
thing. The first does not hit at all, it was a two
plus something. The second one hits: 19 plus seven

03:48:27.071 --> 03:48:30.660
is 26. The third one hits: 16 plus seven hits.

03:48:30.660 --> 03:48:32.369
MATT: That hits, go and roll for damage.

03:48:32.369 --> 03:48:39.051
LIAM: (counting) Four, five, (frustrated noise).
Total of nine fire damage.

03:48:39.051 --> 03:48:39.637
TRAVIS: <i>Nein</i>!

03:48:39.637 --> 03:48:45.176
MATT: Total of nine fire damage to it. As it's
turning back and forth and growling, and Beau's

03:48:45.176 --> 03:48:51.917
harrying it from the side, the two rays of fire
slam into its side and it turns back around. You

03:48:51.917 --> 03:48:56.580
can see the dark burn marks on its white fur where
the impacts have started to burn, and you can see

03:48:56.580 --> 03:49:00.723
some of the skin underneath where the hair has
been burned away is black and cracked. It's hurt

03:49:00.723 --> 03:49:01.310
pretty bad.

03:49:01.310 --> 03:49:06.951
LIAM: I call out as I walk backwards slowly:
Fjord, you got this? Good. I walk, deadpan,

03:49:06.951 --> 03:49:08.741
sideways behind that piece of stone.

03:49:08.741 --> 03:49:10.860
(laughter)

03:49:10.860 --> 03:49:13.118
MATT: Perfect. Ending Caleb's turn, Beau, you're
up.

03:49:13.118 --> 03:49:17.395
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take my staff-- after
I threw my sword, I'm going to crack it in the

03:49:17.395 --> 03:49:19.559
nuts and crack it over the top.

03:49:19.559 --> 03:49:20.893
MATT: Go for it.

03:49:23.263 --> 03:49:26.699
MARISHA: First attack and second-- first attack is
a natural one!

03:49:27.139 --> 03:49:28.316
LAURA: It was so slow--

03:49:28.316 --> 03:49:33.292
MARISHA: It really was. Second attack is a 17.

03:49:34.242 --> 03:49:35.230
MATT: 17 does hit.

03:49:36.500 --> 03:49:41.636
MARISHA: That's in there. That is a four, so eight
damage.

03:49:42.236 --> 03:49:43.486
MATT: Eight points of damage.

03:49:46.486 --> 03:49:50.521
LAURA: Maybe the dice gods really want the charity
to do well.

03:49:51.121 --> 03:49:52.018
LIAM: I think that's it.

03:49:52.018 --> 03:49:57.787
MATT: As you slam it with the second hit up in its
groin area, it's impacted. It's hanging on. It's

03:49:57.787 --> 03:50:00.160
hurting, but it's pretty beat up.

03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:05.254
MARISHA: Spay and neuter your pets! I'm going to
do Flurry of Blows and I'm going to do one more.

03:50:05.254 --> 03:50:08.111
LIAM: Oh, get it. Finish him.

03:50:08.111 --> 03:50:10.526
MARISHA: Oh my god! Another natural one!

03:50:10.526 --> 03:50:11.382
LIAM: That's good.

03:50:11.382 --> 03:50:12.385
TRAVIS: Fuck, it really is.

03:50:12.385 --> 03:50:13.287
SAM: Terrible.

03:50:13.287 --> 03:50:15.321
MARISHA: That's two natural ones in my turn.

03:50:15.321 --> 03:50:19.312
MATT: Yasha and Beau have been hitting two sides
of coin tonight. All right--

03:50:20.722 --> 03:50:22.266
MARISHA: Bob Barker is not here tonight.

03:50:22.266 --> 03:50:24.261
MATT: I know, how many ki points do you have
left?

03:50:24.261 --> 03:50:25.332
MARISHA: That's it. Done.

03:50:25.332 --> 03:50:26.213
MATT: That's the last one. All right.

03:50:26.213 --> 03:50:26.691
SAM: Oh, no.

03:50:26.691 --> 03:50:27.709
MARISHA: Doneskis.

03:50:27.709 --> 03:50:30.866
MATT: Well, that ends Beau's turn, Jester you're
up, and Molly you're after that.

03:50:31.476 --> 03:50:34.736
LAURA: I'm going to Toll the Dead.

03:50:34.736 --> 03:50:35.733
MATT: All righty.

03:50:35.733 --> 03:50:39.711
LAURA: My invoked Jester is going to run around
and stand next to Fjord.

03:50:39.711 --> 03:50:43.941
MATT: Okay. Runs around-- It rolled a 14, what's
your DC?

03:50:43.941 --> 03:50:44.677
LAURA: 14.

03:50:44.677 --> 03:50:46.537
MATT: Resists it, unfortunately.

03:50:46.537 --> 03:50:49.482
SAM: Oh, no. No toll.

03:50:49.482 --> 03:50:49.875
MATT: Sorry.

03:50:49.875 --> 03:50:51.458
LAURA: No toll or anything.

03:50:51.458 --> 03:50:52.579
MATT: Anything else on your turn?

03:50:52.579 --> 03:50:54.497
LAURA: I think that's basically all I can do,
though.

03:50:54.497 --> 03:50:56.082
MATT: Okay. Molly you're up.

03:50:56.082 --> 03:50:59.990
TALIESIN: I'm going to breathe deep and take a run
at this damn thing.

03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.756
TRAVIS: Come on.

03:51:00.756 --> 03:51:05.153
TALIESIN: Straight into it and I'm going to come
swinging out at it.

03:51:05.153 --> 03:51:06.850
TRAVIS: Tell us how you taxidermy it.

03:51:06.850 --> 03:51:09.354
TALIESIN: That's a hit, that's a 23 to hit?

03:51:09.354 --> 03:51:10.089
MATT: That'll hit.

03:51:11.719 --> 03:51:14.101
TALIESIN: This thing doesn't take extra damage
from this does it?

03:51:14.101 --> 03:51:15.457
MATT: No, it does not.

03:51:15.457 --> 03:51:19.143
TALIESIN: No, that's fine. Seven points of damage
for the first hit.

03:51:19.143 --> 03:51:20.565
MATT: Seven points, all righty.

03:51:20.565 --> 03:51:28.986
TALIESIN: Is that right? No, wait, yeah that's
right. Then, 23 to hit-- 21 to hit.

03:51:28.986 --> 03:51:30.199
MATT: Yep, roll damage.

03:51:33.469 --> 03:51:35.163
TALIESIN: That's seven points of damage again.

03:51:35.163 --> 03:51:36.222
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:51:36.222 --> 03:51:38.896
(cheering)

03:51:38.896 --> 03:51:44.731
TALIESIN: I want to go in and I want to see if I
can carve through the mouth as deep in-- I'm going

03:51:44.731 --> 03:51:47.496
to try and get right in there-- I'm going to do a
dental jawbreaker.

03:51:47.496 --> 03:51:52.342
MATT: As you go rushing towards it, it opens its
jaws to strike. You slide down and with one

03:51:52.342 --> 03:51:58.479
scimitar you jam up into its lower jaw, which
causes its upper jaw to be stuck and as you pull

03:51:58.479 --> 03:52:03.414
it out its jaw falls open. As it does, your other
blade, you backswing dropping-- not dropping, but

03:52:03.414 --> 03:52:07.344
holding on with both hands on the other side,
swing through and as it carves in, you actually

03:52:07.344 --> 03:52:14.696
get about one to two feet inward as the jaw lolls
open. The tongue slips out as you cut it from the

03:52:14.696 --> 03:52:19.126
inside of the mouth. Its eyes go dull as the
creature's body collapses to the ground, no longer moving.

03:52:20.493 --> 03:52:21.906
ASHLEY: Fucking yes.

03:52:23.256 --> 03:52:28.284
MATT: With that point, the whole crowd goes
cheering--

03:52:28.284 --> 03:52:29.991
TRAVIS: Yasha, Yasha.

03:52:29.991 --> 03:52:32.066
ALL: Yasha, Yasha.

03:52:32.066 --> 03:52:36.767
MATT: The gates where you came open, and you all
go and return.

03:52:36.767 --> 03:52:41.024
LAURA: The minute that it ends I'm going to start
casting Prayer of Healing.

03:52:41.659 --> 03:52:45.364
MATT: Okay, as you guys step into the back
chamber, you cast Prayer of Healing.

03:52:45.364 --> 03:52:47.471
LAURA: Yeah. Who all is injured right now?

03:52:47.471 --> 03:52:48.656
ASHLEY: I'm pretty bad.

03:52:48.656 --> 03:52:50.572
LAURA: One, two, three, four.

03:52:50.572 --> 03:52:51.756
LIAM: I'm pretty shit.

03:52:51.756 --> 03:52:52.800
MARISHA: I'm not too bad.

03:52:52.800 --> 03:52:54.227
LAURA: You're not and you're not at all?

03:52:54.227 --> 03:52:56.519
SAM: I've been drinking and hiding.

03:52:56.519 --> 03:52:59.495
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to cast it on the five
of us.

03:52:59.495 --> 03:53:00.317
MATT: All righty.

03:53:00.317 --> 03:53:02.646
LIAM: I could get knocked out by a crownsguard
right now.

03:53:02.646 --> 03:53:04.330
TRAVIS: Could you give it to one more? Do you have
to spare?

03:53:04.330 --> 03:53:04.842
LAURA: Yeah.

03:53:04.842 --> 03:53:05.641
TRAVIS: Okay, I'll take some.

03:53:05.641 --> 03:53:07.978
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's what I'm asking. I can do
six people.

03:53:07.978 --> 03:53:09.530
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

03:53:09.530 --> 03:53:12.923
LAURA: That's decent. 14 points to everyone.

03:53:12.923 --> 03:53:17.844
SAM: Oh that's great. That's huge. Wow. Healer.

03:53:17.844 --> 03:53:20.317
MATT: All righty.

03:53:20.317 --> 03:53:23.408
SAM: I think Laura is the best healer we've ever
had.

03:53:23.408 --> 03:53:27.550
(laughter)

03:53:27.550 --> 03:53:33.102
MATT: As you guys pull back into your chamber,
there's a few nods. Darrow's clapping and the rest

03:53:33.102 --> 03:53:39.285
of his team are clapping. There's a clap from two
of the Mountain Makers off to the side. At which

03:53:39.285 --> 03:53:45.938
point, "The Mountain Makers!" are announced and
they step out into the space. As they all gather,

03:53:45.938 --> 03:53:53.163
hiding in the corner, spreading out a bit, two of
the sides open. Out of one, two large furred

03:53:53.163 --> 03:53:57.808
entities about eight to nine feet tall come
rushing in with a combination of fur and feathers,

03:53:57.808 --> 03:54:04.565
these hooked, dark beaks at the tips of their
mouths. Two owlbears come running in and go into

03:54:04.565 --> 03:54:10.477
an assault on these people. They took some hits in
the last battle, and as it goes back and forth,

03:54:10.477 --> 03:54:14.645
you watch as they're striking it and cutting
through. The owlbears are screaming this horrible

03:54:14.645 --> 03:54:19.451
squeal of pain and anguish combined with ravenous
anger, and they start tearing and pulling into

03:54:19.451 --> 03:54:23.361
them. One of them grabs the gnome in its beak,
pulls up and tears its throat out. The gnome

03:54:23.361 --> 03:54:27.676
gurgles as it falls to the ground. The two clerics
immediately come up to the side, getting ready to

03:54:27.676 --> 03:54:33.044
rush out there to try and save its life. Another
one of them manages to hit one of the owlbears in

03:54:33.044 --> 03:54:36.696
its leg as it falls on the ground and they all
start slashing on it. It looks like one owlbear is

03:54:36.696 --> 03:54:42.031
about to fall as the other one, in a complete
frenzy either partnered or what, tears and grabs

03:54:42.031 --> 03:54:46.922
one of the dwarves and starts biting into its face
as it screams, it falls unconscious on the ground.

03:54:46.922 --> 03:54:51.260
It grabs another, and bites into its chest,
throwing it into the sky as they spin off to the

03:54:51.260 --> 03:54:55.421
side. As they all begin to pick up to assault the
one that's going after them, the one on the ground

03:54:55.421 --> 03:55:00.074
slowly gets back up and joins the fray. You watch
one by one as these owlbears, on the cusp of

03:55:00.074 --> 03:55:02.700
dying, tear through the Mountain Makers.

03:55:02.700 --> 03:55:11.951
At which point, the crowd goes like (gasp) "Whoa!"
Big cheers. Cheers because it's a display, but

03:55:11.951 --> 03:55:17.145
also that mournful "Whoa", that low bass-y sound.
At which point you see the two groups come out

03:55:17.145 --> 03:55:22.278
again with the chains and the come up to the
outskirts of the owlbears which then pass out, and

03:55:22.278 --> 03:55:24.793
they put the manacles on and then pull them away.

03:55:24.793 --> 03:55:26.209
TRAVIS: They pass out when the manacles go on?

03:55:26.209 --> 03:55:30.586
MATT: Right as they get up to them, they pass out.
They pull them off, and drag them, the gates open

03:55:30.586 --> 03:55:34.567
wipe, the clerics rush out and grab and drag in
the bodies. The gnome is gone but one of the

03:55:34.567 --> 03:55:38.572
clerics reaches over and touches him, and for a
moment later (gasps) breath comes back and you

03:55:38.572 --> 03:55:45.135
watch the wound close up somewhat. Brought from
death. As they pull the group in--

03:55:45.135 --> 03:55:47.055
LAURA: I need to learn that.

03:55:47.055 --> 03:55:52.655
MATT: The shout comes for the next group. "The
Stubborn Stock returns!" and Darrow and his team

03:55:52.655 --> 03:55:58.454
rush out, giving a pat on the shoulder to Yasha on
the rush out. They go out to the middle field, the

03:55:58.454 --> 03:56:03.733
gates close, and there, two of the gates open on
the sides and you see these dark shapes kind of--

03:56:03.733 --> 03:56:04.983
(materialization noise)

03:56:05.153 --> 03:56:05.796
SAM: Oh, no.

03:56:06.226 --> 03:56:12.260
MATT: Almost skittering but shifting, their
position seems hard to map. At which point you see

03:56:12.260 --> 03:56:18.736
Darrow glance on the side and he goes, "Oh no, I
know what this is!" You watch as these large

03:56:18.736 --> 03:56:22.708
panther-like creatures with large tendrils off
their back whipping begin rushing inward.

03:56:22.708 --> 03:56:24.747
MARISHA: (shouting) Displacer Beasts!

03:56:24.747 --> 03:56:28.127
MATT: One of them swings and strikes, but as he
strikes it passes through and it all of a sudden

03:56:28.127 --> 03:56:32.488
shifts, and was not in the space where it blow and
it pounces onto one of his adventurers. They begin

03:56:32.488 --> 03:56:37.170
to hack back and forth, crowding up around each
other back to back, one of them is pulling out his

03:56:37.170 --> 03:56:41.362
longbow and letting loose arrow after arrow. Some
striking, some missing. One of them all of a

03:56:41.362 --> 03:56:45.438
sudden the phase is lost, it gets struck, and now
it is in a solid place. They use that moment for

03:56:45.438 --> 03:56:50.280
all of them to dash in and surround this one
creature. They manage to, within one round, carve

03:56:50.280 --> 03:56:55.016
down this one displacer beast on one side, the
other pouncing onto Darrow and holding him to the

03:56:55.016 --> 03:57:00.151
ground. Its back legs clawing into his belly as
the others try and pull it off. Darrow takes a

03:57:00.151 --> 03:57:04.579
serious series of wounds before he manages to pull
himself free. The displacer beast grabs another of

03:57:04.579 --> 03:57:09.628
its friends and snaps him in his face. He falls
unconscious and whips around. They strike at it a

03:57:09.628 --> 03:57:13.995
few times, but they can't seem to find where its
body is. It is dodging around until finally Darrow

03:57:13.995 --> 03:57:21.568
is back up, his face covered in blood, takes his
battle axe and swings wide and clocks it in the

03:57:21.568 --> 03:57:28.905
side of the jaw. Its strange illusion form
vanishes at that point, its body coming to a very

03:57:28.905 --> 03:57:33.007
condensed location. They all swarm this one, and
one by one tear it down for the next round.

03:57:33.007 --> 03:57:39.061
They're hurt, their bruised, and Darrow's looking
rough, but with that the Stubborn Stock raise

03:57:39.061 --> 03:57:45.866
their hands "The Stubborn Stock, continues!" and
the crowd cheers.

03:57:45.866 --> 03:57:48.007
LAURA: I was hoping they would lose.

03:57:48.007 --> 03:58:00.035
MATT: As they pull back in, the MC walks back out.
"Two rounds completed, and only two teams remain

03:58:00.356 --> 03:58:12.416
for the third and final round, will they all fall?
Will they all survive? We shall see as next, we

03:58:12.416 --> 03:58:20.108
call forth The Mighty Nein!" Any preparation you
guys have in this moment as the doors begin to open?

03:58:20.108 --> 03:58:21.555
SAM: Everyone--

03:58:21.555 --> 03:58:23.548
TRAVIS: I'm tapped.

03:58:23.882 --> 03:58:24.849
SAM: Wait!

03:58:24.849 --> 03:58:26.010
MARISHA: I'm so tapped.

03:58:26.010 --> 03:58:29.341
SAM: Wait! What if we just stood next to all the
doors and held our action until something came out

03:58:29.341 --> 03:58:29.982
of them?

03:58:31.212 --> 03:58:33.602
TALIESIN: Then they would be alone out there for
like two rounds.

03:58:33.602 --> 03:58:35.338
SAM: What are you talking about?

03:58:35.338 --> 03:58:37.174
LAURA: Well we attack and then run to the middle.

03:58:37.174 --> 03:58:39.261
TRAVIS: Plus somebody's going to be super danger
close right off the bat.

03:58:39.261 --> 03:58:42.912
SAM: Yeah, but we get a hit in on them the second
they came out.

03:58:42.912 --> 03:58:44.898
MARISHA: I'm kind of into it. I--

03:58:45.478 --> 03:58:47.100
TALIESIN: That seems like a terrible plan.

03:58:47.100 --> 03:58:48.706
SAM: Why is that a terrible idea?

03:58:48.706 --> 03:58:51.201
TRAVIS: We've got some super squishy people in
here that won't make it past--

03:58:51.201 --> 03:58:52.729
TALIESIN: We're all one hit away from--

03:58:52.729 --> 03:58:53.789
LAURA: We might get a surprise attack on them.

03:58:53.789 --> 03:58:55.494
SAM: We would get a surprise round on them!

03:58:55.494 --> 03:58:56.395
TALIESIN: I don't think we would get--

03:58:56.395 --> 03:58:57.740
MARISHA: There's only like four doors right?

03:58:57.740 --> 03:58:59.602
SAM: Yeah, so pick four people I'll take one of
them.

03:58:59.602 --> 03:59:01.263
MARISHA: Pick the less squishy?

03:59:01.263 --> 03:59:02.988
TRAVIS: All right, if that's what you guys want to
do.

03:59:02.988 --> 03:59:04.067
LAURA: Let's do it.

03:59:04.067 --> 03:59:05.580
TALIESIN: I think it's a terrible plan.

03:59:05.580 --> 03:59:07.330
MARISHA: It might be a terrible plan.

03:59:07.330 --> 03:59:08.441
SAM: Let's do it!

03:59:08.441 --> 03:59:10.008
MARISHA: No, no, no, I'm kind of into it.

03:59:10.008 --> 03:59:14.169
ASHLEY: We could also try to get inside and get
the chains because they are scared of those and--

03:59:14.169 --> 03:59:19.558
LIAM: I am snapping my fingers and bringing
Frumpkin scarf-like around my neck, under my hood.

03:59:19.558 --> 03:59:20.178
Just to have him with me.

03:59:20.178 --> 03:59:20.579
MATT: All right.

03:59:20.743 --> 03:59:21.366
MARISHA: Yasha--

03:59:21.366 --> 03:59:27.286
MATT: At this point the crowd's cheering, "Mighty
Nein! Mighty Nein! Mighty Nein!"

03:59:27.286 --> 03:59:27.639
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:59:27.639 --> 03:59:29.390
MATT: The doors are open, what are you guys
doing?

03:59:30.040 --> 03:59:31.818
TRAVIS: I'll go take one of the doors.

03:59:31.818 --> 03:59:33.819
SAM: I'm taking a door.

03:59:34.113 --> 03:59:35.508
ASHLEY: I'm taking a fucking door.

03:59:35.508 --> 03:59:37.051
TRAVIS: For the record, I do not like this plan.

03:59:37.051 --> 03:59:37.638
SAM: I love it!

03:59:37.638 --> 03:59:38.335
ASHLEY: I don't like it.

03:59:38.335 --> 03:59:38.987
MATT: Who's going where?

03:59:38.987 --> 03:59:42.531
MARISHA: If we stay flanking somebody, anyone who
runs away from us--

03:59:42.531 --> 03:59:44.118
ASHLEY: Oh that's true, that's true.

03:59:44.118 --> 03:59:46.389
MARISHA: Maybe we can go, you want to take a
door?

03:59:46.389 --> 03:59:48.775
MATT: How long does your illusion last?

03:59:48.775 --> 03:59:55.783
LAURA: Invoke Duplicity I think lasts for-- I want
to say an hour but I don't know if it does.

03:59:55.783 --> 03:59:59.837
LIAM: I will stay with Fjord.

03:59:59.837 --> 04:00:00.955
SAM: I'll take a door.

04:00:00.955 --> 04:00:02.519
MATT: Caleb's going to stay with Fjord.

04:00:02.519 --> 04:00:03.781
TRAVIS: You should get some distance.

04:00:03.781 --> 04:00:05.480
MARISHA: Yasha and I will take a door.

04:00:05.480 --> 04:00:06.507
SAM: Just pick me a door.

04:00:06.507 --> 04:00:08.248
MATT: Pick you a door? No, you get to pick, Nott.

04:00:08.248 --> 04:00:09.535
SAM: This one's fine, it don't matter.

04:00:09.535 --> 04:00:10.799
MATT: Right next to there.

04:00:10.799 --> 04:00:11.413
TRAVIS: Any ideas?

04:00:11.413 --> 04:00:12.444
TALIESIN: This is such a bad idea.

04:00:12.444 --> 04:00:14.981
TRAVIS: The idea is that whatever doors they come
out of will get one surprise round and

04:00:14.981 --> 04:00:17.962
then whoever's by those doors better be able to
take some damage--

04:00:17.962 --> 04:00:19.284
MARISHA: Defend themselves, yeah.

04:00:19.284 --> 04:00:22.399
TRAVIS: You don't want to be near me. You should
be in the middle, able to move.

04:00:22.399 --> 04:00:23.597
MATT: What are you doing, Yasha?

04:00:23.597 --> 04:00:26.886
ASHLEY: I'm over there flanking with Beau.

04:00:26.886 --> 04:00:30.557
LAURA: I'm going to go, with me and you Molly on
the other door.

04:00:30.557 --> 04:00:32.398
TALIESIN: This is such a bad idea.

04:00:32.398 --> 04:00:34.155
SAM: (laughter)

04:00:34.155 --> 04:00:37.032
TALIESIN: This is going to be like two rounds to
get to whoever--

04:00:37.032 --> 04:00:39.063
MATT: How long does Invoke Duplicity last?

04:00:39.063 --> 04:00:42.354
TALIESIN: You're going to be alone for two full
rounds with whatever this thing is.

04:00:42.354 --> 04:00:43.817
MARISHA: I'm fast as fuck.

04:00:43.817 --> 04:00:47.834
TALIESIN: Yeah, what if you're there-- what if it
comes out of that door?

04:00:47.834 --> 04:00:51.841
LIAM: All right, this is how much time we have to
plan in the moment as this is happening.

04:00:51.841 --> 04:00:53.145
TALIESIN: This is a terrible plan.

04:00:53.145 --> 04:00:53.724
MATT: Guys--

04:00:53.724 --> 04:00:55.058
MARISHA: Wait what are all the doors by-the-by?

04:00:55.058 --> 04:00:56.459
TRAVIS: Yeah, there are four doors right?

04:00:56.459 --> 04:00:57.209
MARISHA: There are four doors?

04:00:57.209 --> 04:00:58.261
TALIESIN: No, there's one two--

04:00:58.261 --> 04:01:00.216
MATT: For one minute, so your Invoke Duplicity's
gone.

04:01:00.216 --> 04:01:01.366
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to hop up--

04:01:01.366 --> 04:01:03.422
TRAVIS: I don't know if the map is accurate to how
many doors there are--

04:01:03.422 --> 04:01:05.949
MARISHA: Yeah, Matt, can you please do us a favor
and point out the doors?

04:01:05.949 --> 04:01:10.552
MATT: Right. One, two, the map is accurate to
them, four--

04:01:10.552 --> 04:01:13.240
TRAVIS: Fuck that, no, no, no we've got to get in
the middle. This is a terrible plan.

04:01:13.240 --> 04:01:14.775
MARISHA: There are five doors.

04:01:14.775 --> 04:01:15.510
TRAVIS: There's too many doors.

04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.919
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.

04:01:15.919 --> 04:01:17.452
MATT: Five doors. You guys exit from this one
here.

04:01:17.452 --> 04:01:19.331
LAURA: I'm going to do the same thing and hop up
on a wall like last time.

04:01:19.331 --> 04:01:21.817
SAM: Wait, we come in from one of the doors, so
there's only four.

04:01:23.477 --> 04:01:24.564
MATT: Yeah, you came in from this one.

04:01:24.564 --> 04:01:26.459
MARISHA: Oh, that's a good point.

04:01:26.459 --> 04:01:27.823
SAM: Yeah, there's only four doors.

04:01:27.823 --> 04:01:29.638
TRAVIS: There's those four others besides the one
we came in?

04:01:29.638 --> 04:01:30.674
MATT: Four others beside you guys yeah.

04:01:30.674 --> 04:01:31.455
LIAM: This is about how well we do--

04:01:31.455 --> 04:01:33.345
MATT: Guys, quickly. Coming in, what are you
doing?

04:01:33.345 --> 04:01:36.127
MARISHA: Four doors, four doors, I'm going to--
I'm going to stay by Yasha.

04:01:36.127 --> 04:01:37.160
MATT: What's your plan?

04:01:37.160 --> 04:01:38.443
MARISHA: Anything else I don't care.

04:01:38.443 --> 04:01:40.939
LAURA: I'm going to hold my attack for the door
that--

04:01:40.939 --> 04:01:43.807
TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the opposite point
from Caleb.

04:01:43.807 --> 04:01:46.560
TRAVIS: No, no, we got to come in the center, we
got to take advantage of the sentinels.

04:01:46.560 --> 04:01:47.059
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:01:47.059 --> 04:01:50.147
TRAVIS: That's the point of the feat. We're spread
way too fucking thin.

04:01:50.147 --> 04:01:51.302
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is so bad.

04:01:51.302 --> 04:01:52.325
TRAVIS: Go back in the middle like we thought we
were going to do.

04:01:52.325 --> 04:01:53.429
TALIESIN: We're going to drop so fast.

04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:56.896
MATT: The crowd cheering dies down, what are you
guys doing?

04:01:56.896 --> 04:02:03.061
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. How about we take Sam's
similar approach, but we guard these four incidences.

04:02:03.921 --> 04:02:04.751
MATT: What are you doing?

04:02:04.751 --> 04:02:08.288
MARISHA: Okay Yasha and I are going to move here,
and guard these two.

04:02:08.288 --> 04:02:11.376
TALIESIN: I'm going to go against the wall,
against the back of that wall there.

04:02:11.376 --> 04:02:13.496
SAM: I stay where I am and I'm casting Mage Hand.

04:02:13.496 --> 04:02:17.399
LIAM: It is hard to walk on two legs, maybe four
is better.

04:02:17.399 --> 04:02:19.469
SAM: Holding my attack!

04:02:19.469 --> 04:02:22.223
LAURA: I want to be on the other one.

04:02:22.223 --> 04:02:24.268
ASHLEY: Nott, you're staying there?

04:02:24.268 --> 04:02:27.351
SAM: I'm staying and I'm holding my attack until
something runs out of my door.

04:02:27.351 --> 04:02:28.759
MATT: Nott, you're staying there?

04:02:28.759 --> 04:02:32.126
SAM: I'm ready to shoot anything that comes out of
this door.

04:02:32.126 --> 04:02:34.534
TALIESIN: You're going to be at disadvantage
because it's going to be right next to you.

04:02:34.534 --> 04:02:35.144
LAURA: You're too close.

04:02:35.144 --> 04:02:36.771
SAM: No, I'm not. I have a crossbow feat.

04:02:36.771 --> 04:02:38.507
ASHLEY: They won't see him maybe they won't--

04:02:38.507 --> 04:02:43.533
MATT: As the quiet has this stillness that's come
across the whole battlefield, every breath is

04:02:43.533 --> 04:02:47.483
being held. You all in your chaos, running around
and trying to shout orders to each other, you all

04:02:47.483 --> 04:03:04.045
eventually come to settle in this place. (slow,
heavy footfalls, roaring) All the doors come

04:03:04.045 --> 04:03:16.242
upward. Heavy, repeated footfalls hit, before
bursting out of the far end, you see a Hill Giant

04:03:16.242 --> 04:03:17.885
come barreling through.

04:03:17.885 --> 04:03:20.362
(yelling)

04:03:20.362 --> 04:03:27.467
MATT: Knocking that pillar down, as it stands
there in the center of the field, you see now its--

04:03:28.217 --> 04:03:29.711
TRAVIS: (shouting) My door, my door!

04:03:29.711 --> 04:03:38.176
MATT: It has these tiny little spines stuck into
it, like it's been agitated and pushed to a point

04:03:38.176 --> 04:03:41.232
of absolute rage and anger. It's just roaring.

04:03:44.502 --> 04:03:46.724
SAM: I-- I let my crossbow bolt go.

04:03:46.724 --> 04:03:48.021
MATT: All right, you release it?

04:03:48.021 --> 04:03:52.882
SAM: Just out into the-- "Oh fuck!" No, not at it.
Nope.

04:03:52.882 --> 04:03:56.060
MATT: All right, and this is where we're going to
pick up next week.

04:03:56.060 --> 04:03:58.190
(yelling)

04:03:58.190 --> 04:03:59.400
MATT: Because it's 11 o'clock.

04:03:59.400 --> 04:04:00.721
TRAVIS: Two spines in the side.

04:04:00.721 --> 04:04:05.160
ASHLEY: Dang it! I want to fight it right now!

04:04:05.160 --> 04:04:06.237
MARISHA and MATT: I know.

04:04:06.237 --> 04:04:06.607
LIAM: Yep.

04:04:06.607 --> 04:04:07.929
MARISHA: I have no ki points.

04:04:07.929 --> 04:04:09.523
TRAVIS: Oh my God.

04:04:09.523 --> 04:04:10.843
MATT: That's going to be fun.

04:04:10.843 --> 04:04:12.412
SAM: That is a huge thing.

04:04:12.412 --> 04:04:14.235
TRAVIS: (laughter) My door!

04:04:14.235 --> 04:04:15.963
MARISHA: That's good times.

04:04:15.963 --> 04:04:19.421
TALIESIN: Aren't you glad you weren't standing
there by yourself for that?

04:04:19.421 --> 04:04:20.265
TRAVIS: Yep.

04:04:20.265 --> 04:04:21.626
MARISHA: I mean--

04:04:21.626 --> 04:04:23.259
SAM: Would have gotten two hits in.

04:04:23.259 --> 04:04:24.038
MARISHA: You would have been fine.

04:04:24.038 --> 04:04:26.374
SAM: We're just as far away from the thing.

04:04:26.374 --> 04:04:27.194
TALIESIN: You get one.

04:04:27.194 --> 04:04:29.779
SAM: Yeah, but there was two people standing next
to that door.

04:04:29.779 --> 04:04:30.873
LAURA: No, there was just Fjord.

04:04:30.873 --> 04:04:32.438
SAM: At one point there was Fjord and Caleb.

04:04:32.438 --> 04:04:33.227
LAURA: Yeah, he moved.

04:04:33.227 --> 04:04:34.540
MARISHA: Caleb wussed out.

04:04:34.540 --> 04:04:40.404
SAM: If you had stuck to the plan, you would have
gotten two hits, and we're all just as far away as

04:04:40.404 --> 04:04:41.485
we were before.

04:04:41.485 --> 04:04:46.468
MaTT: It's true. We're going to pick up next week
at the start of this final round.

04:04:46.468 --> 04:04:48.181
LAURA: Oh, god.

04:04:48.181 --> 04:04:50.457
TALIESIN: It would have been three rounds before I
could do any damage. Before it killed him.

04:04:50.457 --> 04:04:51.979
SAM: Well you shouldn't have been that far away.

04:04:51.979 --> 04:04:54.140
TALIESIN: (shouting) It's my door! Oh, my god.

04:04:54.140 --> 04:04:56.104
(laughter)

04:04:56.104 --> 04:04:57.468
TRAVIS: Oh, my god.

04:04:57.468 --> 04:05:01.217
MATT: Oh, man. This is going to be fun.

04:05:01.217 --> 04:05:03.373
TALIESIN: Overestimating the value of surprise.

04:05:03.373 --> 04:05:09.175
MATT: This is a very angry hill giant rushing
towards you right now. Giant great club in its

04:05:09.175 --> 04:05:17.166
hand. It's going to be fun. All right guys, we'll
pick this up next week. In the meantime, have a

04:05:17.166 --> 04:05:22.181
